    "# Classifying YouTube Comments using Supervised Learning\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use supervised learning techniques to classify YouTube comments. The goal is to categorize comments into different classes such as positive, negative, spam, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved:\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of YouTube comments along with their corresponding labels.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the comments by removing special characters, stop words, and perform other necessary preprocessing steps.\n",
    "3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.\n",
    "4. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) for classification.\n",
    "5. **Training the Model**: Train the model using the training dataset.\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model\\'s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "7. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new YouTube comments.\n",

Im guessing the 10% tariff on China was not intended to hurt China but essentially redistribute money from US companies or the public to the US government by using Chinese goods. Because people will buy Chinese goods regardless of a small increase in Tariff, the US knows it, it will unlikely affect the trade volume with China. But if you're going to do so, there needs to be prior communication with China, you cant simply use another countries goods to re-direct money flow in your economy without asking first. China most likely knows it too. But as you can see, all of the goods ta-riffed on China are easily replaceable either in house or by China's good neighbor Russia. So actually the US will be receiving less money from China because Chinese companies/government will most likely switch suppliers to Russia instead.\r\nRead more\r\nReply\r\n@robertjohnson-mt8pz\r\n1 day ago\r\nI'm glad China is tariffing coal and LNG.

I think the right way to do it is to analyze where these funds are going and cutting all unnecessary expenses, even if it means scaling back. Doing it the current way just shines a negative light towards the US unfortunately. Also logically, to be a manufacturing hub takes years to develop. There just isn't enough time to catch up to China within 5 years, amongst many other things like the high labor cost, for example. Let's see how this plays out.

The troops were already there.The money for Canadian border response upgrades and funding for the same were in place LAST December.  The current president's ‘people in the know” (researchers? division heads? - let's say \"staff\") might have only been responding to the markets and he was the messenger, portraying it as his idea.

As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it’s a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, \"A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.\" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone.

Im guessing the 10% tariff on China was not intended to hurt China but essentially redistribute money from US companies or the public to the US government by using Chinese goods. Because people will buy Chinese goods regardless of a small increase in Tariff, the US knows it, it will unlikely affect the trade volume with China. But if you\\'re going to do so, there needs to be prior communication with China, you cant simply use another countries goods to re-direct money flow in your economy without asking first. China most likely knows it too. But as you can see, all of the goods ta-riffed on China are easily replaceable either in house or by China\\'s good neighbor Russia. So actually the US will be receiving less money from China because Chinese companies/government will most likely switch suppliers to Russia instead.\\r\\nRead more\\r\\nReply\\r\\n@robertjohnson-mt8pz\\r\\n1 day ago\\r\\nI\\'m glad China is tariffing coal and LNG.

      "China probably won this one. Im guessing the 10% tariff on China was not intended to hurt China but essentially redistribute money from US companies or the public to the US government by using Chinese goods. Because people will buy Chinese goods regardless of a small increase in Tariff, the US knows it, it will unlikely affect the trade volume with China. But if you're going to do so, there needs to be prior communication with China, you cant simply use another countries goods to re-direct money flow in your economy without asking first. China most likely knows it too. But as you can see, all of the goods ta-riffed on China are easily replaceable either in house or by China's good neighbor Russia. So actually the US will be receiving less money from China because Chinese companies/government will most likely switch suppliers to Russia instead.\n",

For years Mexico has already had 10,000 troops at their Northern border since it was required of them by the last U.S. administration. The troops were already there.The money for Canadian border response upgrades and funding for the same were in place LAST December.  The current president's ‘people in the know” (researchers? division heads? - let's say \"staff\") might have only been responding to the markets and he was the messenger, portraying it as his idea.  I and EVERYONE I know and have spoken with will continue to boycott U.S. goods until President Trump is gone.\n",

Im guessing the 10% tariff on China was not intended to hurt China but essentially redistribute money from US companies or the public to the US government by using Chinese goods. Because people will buy Chinese goods regardless of a small increase in Tariff, the US knows it, it will unlikely affect the trade volume with China. But if you\\'re going to do so, there needs to be prior communication with China, you cant simply use another countries goods to re-direct money flow in your economy without asking first. China most likely knows it too. But as you can see, all of the goods ta-riffed on China are easily replaceable either in house or by China\\'s good neighbor Russia. So actually the US will be receiving less money from China because Chinese companies/government will most likely switch suppliers to Russia instead.\\r\\nRead more\\r\\nReply\\r\\n@robertjohnson-mt8pz\\r\\n1 day ago\\r\\nI\\'m glad China is tariffing coal and LNG.

China announced tariffs on a range of US products moments after President Donald Trump imposed a 10% tariff on goods from Beijing. China hit US coal and liquefied natural gas exports with a 15% levy, and targeted its oil and agricultural equipment with a 10% fee. Bloomberg's Minmin Low reports.

The Chinese attitude is that there is no point in negotiating. Obviously, the US government never keeps its word, and it is a waste of time to try to reach any agreement with a liar. So, if the opponent wants to fight, then let's fight.

The recent escalation of trade tensions underscores a critical truth: America’s economic challenges—stagnant wages, widening wealth inequality, and the erosion of middle-class prosperity—stem not from trade imbalances but from systemic failures in domestic wealth distribution. Imposing tariffs on Chinese goods will not revive hollowed-out industries, address soaring healthcare and education costs, or reverse decades of corporate tax cuts and deregulation that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Instead, such measures risk raising prices for everyday Americans, hurting farmers and manufacturers reliant on global markets, and diverting attention from urgent reforms needed to rebuild equitable access to opportunity. True solutions lie in policies that prioritize workers over Wall Street, invest in infrastructure and education, and ensure corporations and the ultra-rich pay their fair share—not in counterproductive trade wars that punish ordinary citizens while ignoring root causes.

I just don't understand starting trade war's with 3 of your biggest trading partners at once and then trying to act like they cant harm you. Individually each country would only have limited damage on the US economy, but all 3 countries responding with counter tariffs at once would have a big impact on the US, and take us all down a dark road to some sort of dystopian future.

Both US and China knows this trade war is only going to escalate, it's been going on for almost 10 years now.  Just as US has been decoupling from China, China is trying to do the same.  Currently, the balance is in US favor as China has less stuff it can put tarrif on the US and the economy has been doing poorly since 2022. Fortunately my relatives are relatively wealthy shanghainese and are able to wealther this. The new grads and blue collar workers are going to have even harder time finding jobs and have to take lower pay now.

Canada and the United States share one of the world's strongest and most prosperous partnerships. Our two nations are not just neighbours—we are allies, economic partners, and friends with a deep history of collaboration for the greater good of both countries. Lately, there has been misleading information suggesting that Canada is taking advantage of the U.S. This is simply not true. A strong economic relationship benefits both nations, and any attempt to undermine this partnership through tariffs would ultimately result in a lose-lose situation. Increased trade barriers would harm businesses, disrupt supply chains, and impact jobs on both sides of the border.
Rather than focusing on rhetoric, it is essential to examine the facts. I encourage everyone to research what is being reported rather than who is reporting it. The truth is that Canada and the U.S. thrive when we work together, and maintaining a strong economic relationship is in both countries' best interests. Our focus should remain on cooperation, economic stability, and shared prosperity.

Didn't China learn last time?  100% tariff on Chinese goods into the USA is almost no increase because it's pennies on the dollar, and because Chinese companies will just race to the bottom and sell things cheaper still.  And 100% tariff on American goods into China is crippling.  Both ways, China's almost-slavery wages get worse in a society already boldly rejecting the CCP.

We did this during Trump's 1st term. We're a much larger economy (almost 50% larger than China). If we don't buy, China's economy will be severely hurt. We are 28% of the entire global GDP. China is only 20%.And the huge difference is we're a consumer economy. The last time they tried this Trump hit back. After a few weeks China asked to end the tariff war.

"Not victory.... the shroud of the darkside has fallen. Begun, the trade war has."
Bring it on. China is ready and prepared.
"President Trump is playing chess with these countries knowing which move to make to get them to the bargining table , while Biden was sleeping the last 4 years . This is the difference America is seeing between the 2 presidents ."
"There is no negotiation, there's only trump getting embarrased and bending his knees again like he did to mexico and canada, but his mouth keep yapping art of the deal (gone wrong) "
Trump you just outplayed yourself.
Trump is saying you need to buy more of my crap to improve my country instead of us buying things that actually work 
Trump can forget about buying TikTok.
Trump is out of mind
"US is in a no win situation. Unlike Trump 1.0, China is well prepared for Trump 2.0 now. The 2 countries should show respect for each other and promote cooperation instead of confrontation."
Trump will be humbled soon 
Pls God not more Boeings 
"What an embarrassment for America.  Trump has shown he is nothing more than an old Toothless dog that cant even bark, only whimpers.
The dog came out with fire in his eyes and nothing more.   You guys voted him in, but jeez not even a woof...."
i thought tariff is a tax on citizens?
Trump took the biggest L on his dumb tarrif game
Why don’t the Chinese government just tax  the Tesla factory in China ?
"The recent escalation of trade tensions underscores a critical truth: America’s economic challenges—stagnant wages, widening wealth inequality, and the erosion of middle-class prosperity—stem not from trade imbalances but from systemic failures in domestic wealth distribution. Imposing tariffs on Chinese goods will not revive hollowed-out industries, address soaring healthcare and education costs, or reverse decades of corporate tax cuts and deregulation that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Instead, such measures risk raising prices for everyday Americans, hurting farmers and manufacturers reliant on global markets, and diverting attention from urgent reforms needed to rebuild equitable access to opportunity. True solutions lie in policies that prioritize workers over Wall Street, invest in infrastructure and education, and ensure corporations and the ultra-rich pay their fair share—not in counterproductive trade wars that punish ordinary citizens while ignoring root causes."
"The economy is struggling with uncertainties, global fluctuations, and the lingering effects of the tariffs, leading to instability. Rising inflation, slow growth, and trade disruptions require immediate action from all sectors to restore stability and promote growth."
They should close the tesla factory
At least China gives us products that don't cost us hundreds of dollars and on top of it the food they send over is probably better than what we get here in the US
"Everyone the US government starts the fight, and play victim.. like bro, you started the trade war, and you justified it by saying it’s someone else fault. And us was one of the major contributor that built the free trade system, what is going on?"
US tariffs is about collecting tax revenues.
i'm fully expecting china to demand 50% of android ownership 
I can just...FEEL the love.
"Bring it on China!
We good here!"
Tit for tat tariffs 
"I like the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade; he made a wise counterattack. e.g, China export 4.7B tons coal to world and import 3.4M tons coal from US. Trade war for Chinese consumers, this is just a matter of origin. But for American consumers, this is about the cost of living."
Charge China with 25% Tariff
"Just wait. Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and Panama all changed their tune."
"I just don't understand starting trade war's with 3 of your biggest trading partners at once and then trying to act like they cant harm you. Individually each country would only have limited damage on the US economy, but all 3 countries responding with counter tariffs at once would have a big impact on the US, and take us all down a dark road to some sort of dystopian future."
China was already tariffing US goods. This isn’t a big change
China has started shifting most of cars to the electric cars since 2020.  Less import of raw Oil etc. is highly expected.
"And by the way, China shall be prepared for a more aggressive tariff increase, not only 10%. So, US, are you ready?"
... moderate and well targeted Chinese reaction to a childish president's tantrum ...
I could not care less about China
"Put tariffs on tesla, apple"
How dare they
战争要打多久，我看我们不要做决定，过去是由杜鲁门、现在是由艾森豪威尔或者是美国将来的什么总统。就是说，你们要打多久，就打多久，一直打到，完全胜利！
"Canada might as well strike a bilateral trade deal with China at this point, just like Mexico did. If Mexico joins BRICS+, that would really make things interesting. Also, at this point, all deals are off the table with the US. Just do what’s best for your nation."
Why is Tesla left out? 
"Both US and China knows this trade war is only going to escalate, it's been going on for almost 10 years now.  Just as US has been decoupling from China, China is trying to do the same.  Currently, the balance is in US favor as China has less stuff it can put tarrif on the US and the economy has been doing poorly since 2022. Fortunately my relatives are relatively wealthy shanghainese and are able to wealther this. The new grads and blue collar workers are going to have even harder time finding jobs and have to take lower pay now."
"China needs the US consumers. US wants the Chinese goods. It hurts both countries, but in different ways. US has an imperative to lower its debt."
Bend your knees to whoever is bullying you is not a right altitude for negotiation...
"Dear China, 
Canada is opening an LNG port on the Pacific this summer. A great place to get tariff-free LNG"
Dow Jones Industrial Average is going to suffer China Syndrome.hehe..
"Well, Trump might seem like radical but he actually needs the inflation to come down,  Trump cannot risk to increase the price because of tariff, that is the weakness of election politics."
"you want play？
let's play！"
Trump putting Chinese People on the streets 1 tariff at a time. 
"Canada and the United States share one of the world's strongest and most prosperous partnerships. Our two nations are not just neighbours—we are allies, economic partners, and friends with a deep history of collaboration for the greater good of both countries. Lately, there has been misleading information suggesting that Canada is taking advantage of the U.S. This is simply not true. A strong economic relationship benefits both nations, and any attempt to undermine this partnership through tariffs would ultimately result in a lose-lose situation. Increased trade barriers would harm businesses, disrupt supply chains, and impact jobs on both sides of the border.
Rather than focusing on rhetoric, it is essential to examine the facts. I encourage everyone to research what is being reported rather than who is reporting it. The truth is that Canada and the U.S. thrive when we work together, and maintaining a strong economic relationship is in both countries' best interests. Our focus should remain on cooperation, economic stability, and shared prosperity."
US companies should move factories to India. Only India can make goods at a cheaper price and same quality and scale as China.
It's about fair trade it's a drug war
You all have house. Why can't you grow your own vegetables? This is a privilege reserved for the rich in China.
Investigation into Google to protect and promote American Maoism in the face of America First? Prayers
"Tariff: 
Triggers saving money. 
Do we really need what they sell? 
Society says we need thier products? 
Save your money, let the supply go up. 
It will lower prices again. ️
Learn patience rather than panicking, and screaming  like a new born."
"Like TikTok, Google needs to sell its interest to Chinese?"
Decouple yay!
Aww. Now poorly made junk is going to get expensive. LMAO The less solar panels the better.
"Having the best president in the world. Donald Trump, the United States is blessed, $57,000 in a space of 3 weeks, now I can sit back and watch my investment progress️ my regards to Wesley Shirley Christian and all registered brokers in the United States 2025 is blessed already.."
"Here two uncles from two opposite of the world are fighting with tariffs and whatnot and the whole world are in fear of inflation, recession."
Suspend the constitution and let trump have at it USA
Xi🇨🇳
"People do realize the banned means no iPad and computer, as those rare material which are irreplaceable.. if China stop exporting them, then US can’t even make them… and they will have to import those product from places like Canada and Mexico.. so any one willing to pay 25% more for their phone and computer?"
Nothing more to talk about. Decouple by all means.
"Why Google? what business does Google have in China anyway, didn't Google exit the Chinese market many years ago?"
"Poor Temu, now what will the CCP do?"
来而不往非礼也！
"It’s not even good or bad to anyone, it’s stupid.  Because it hurts self, isn’t that stupid, then why doing it?"
New 30% tariff on China in the morning.
18年都搞不定的现在还来玩这套，完全不卖给美国又能如何

Lot of Chinese trolls in comments 
"India caved in even before Trump's upcoming meeting with India, which proves that they are sp in eless  Trump Trade Tensions: India Slashes Import Duties Ahead of Talks (featuring Palki Sharma). How brave"
They know they are about to lose the Panama canal.
They hardly buy anything from us anyway.
"I think I'll change my u.s currancy(because its shrinking in value)..to brics..
And instead of tesla..B.Y.D the superior electric car!!!"
China is trying to advance so that its people can prosper. Is it wrong that the US is trying so hard to stop it? Is it only the US and its allies who can prosper?
"Hahahaha... Google is banned in China. So, how can China accuse Google of unfair competition."
this is the elite version of thinking you have the only gun in the world.
So many 50 cent army bots in the comments
"Knowing how ill-conceived Trump's tariff wars are, this will be over before weekend."
"Didn't China learn last time?  100% tariff on Chinese goods into the USA is almost no increase because it's pennies on the dollar, and because Chinese companies will just race to the bottom and sell things cheaper still.  And 100% tariff on American goods into China is crippling.  Both ways, China's almost-slavery wages get worse in a society already boldly rejecting the CCP."
China should put 100% tariff on Tesla and iPhone. Since there have many other good EV brand and smart phones on China.
wonder why China not imposing export tax on the products to USA. instead of letting US government to collect tariff.
中国都不接你们电话了

As an American I hope it's 200^ on all things made in China. They don't buy from us anyI hope we quit buying from any country we have a trade deficit with. Tired ofbeings everybody's defense
Tesla is a proxy of Trump in China. 
"No doubt the usual racist, Sinophobic comments will be on here, permitted by this platform, despite supposed “community guidelines”."

"China is now too big to fail by virtue of having had 104> years of secure, disciplined, single party communist governance. It is by continuing to earn the confidence and trust of China's 1.4< billion population that the CPC will guarantee China's continued progress."

"Instead of asking for leniency and forgiveness, China's 🇨🇳 determination to fight back Trump's tariffs will only hurt China more."
"We did this during Trump's 1st term. We're a much larger economy (almost 50% larger than China). If we don't buy, China's economy will be severely hurt. We are 28% of the entire global GDP. China is only 20%.And the huge difference is we're a consumer economy. The last time they tried this Trump hit back. After a few weeks China asked to end the tariff war."
We’re doing our enemies work for them. LMAO so stupid some people are still celebrating tariffs
期待中美经济脱钩
Fafo for Anglo Saxons 
"To the relief of the planet, it seems that the day is not far away when the American dollar will no longer be the ""strong"" currency of the world economy and Trump is disastrously anticipating this! Good for emerging economies and for China, Canada and the European Union! Just like that!
The smart Chinese ""comrade"" embodied the true SUN TZU Lol...."
Don't mass with COVID.

CCP can't do anything but criticize.
"The economy can actually get better if only the govt can start making better decisions for the sake of it's citizens, cos' they've really made life more difficult for its residents. Hyperinflation has left the less haves bearing the brunt of the burden. It's already eating into my entire $520k retirement portfolio. Like where else can we invest our money with less risks?"
Why is Tesla left out?

Canadian here, and I think Canada would be a great European Union member state! Our resources are VAST, and with a solid market of 26 other nations in need of rare earth metals, oil and gas, why not? Its such a win win situation!
Europeans are multicultural, and so is Canada!
Europeans have universal health care! So does Canada!
Europeans have strict gun control! So does Canada!
Europeans believe in a multi-polar world! So does Canada!
I'd vote for Canada to join the EU for sure!
Though we would likely need to keep our currency, to stabilize influence from the USA but there isn't much resistance to that.

Canadians would overwhelmingly support being part of the EU and would solve many of the challenges for the EU. Canada ranks globally
- The largest known supply of rare earth minerals.
- 3rd largest oil reserves
- 3rd largest renewable fresh water source
- arctic trade route would cut shipping costs by at least half, and the EU could help develop it with Greenland and the Baltic‚Äôs gaining prosperity and security. 
- Germany receiving high quality and reliable Canadian softwood/oil/minerals and get back to the industrial heavyweight it was
- Britain once known for being the architects of the greatest fleets the world ever saw, get back to building vessels, Canada needs your expertise to open the arctic trade. 
- France knows that Canada is one of the largest French populations anywhere and is an official language in Canada making tourism and trade easy. 
I know I left out so many other European countries but you get the point, Canada and the EU would be one of the greatest deals ever made.

Our history should have taught us before this that the U.S. have never respected our sovereignty, but I feel the E.U. is based on responsible goverenance and cooperation, and we could only benefit from the relationship and contribute toward the Union.  We will NEVER become the 51st state.  Trump wants our oil, minerals, and water, and he wants them for free.  Please continue this Canada in the E.U. conversation!

The easy answer is yes Canada could join the EU, Why? Because Canada owns Vimy Ridge a territory in Europe,  European land equals European country, also Canada has strong European history and is part owned by European countries, also Europe is forever grateful for Canada's support in WW2 and Canada would not be denied membership for all these reasons, also Canada and the EU have very similar principals. Canada Joining the EU would be a bonus for both ends. I hope it happens.

As a Canadian of European heritage and family, I would be thrilled to join the EU. However, The EU already has problems wrangling the member nations that it has and finding consensus. However, some kind of associate membership like several Scandinavian have would be viable. If I get a chance, I will vote for it.

I guarantee you this. A huge majority of Canadians if forced to choose between becoming an American state or an EU member, would choose the EU in a heartbeat. America is clinically insane.

As a Canadian who is reading comments from other Canadians saying they would be 'open to joining the EU', I urge them to reconsider!
Joining the EU is not a 'party' and you need to remember that there are 27 other countries that will have to vote each time there is a decision to be made
You can't just do what you want
We are 'strong and free' right now as we are, with our own rules and we don't have to answer to anyone
The EU are our friends and they are great, but not for Canada to join
Let's just keep the great relationship we have with them and make it even stronger!

Canada joining the EU just makes SO much sense. We're a huge country - the size of Europe - with a small population.  We're one of the most ethnically diverse nations on the planet. Our TWO national languages are English and French, but we speak Hindi, Cantonese, Mandarin, German, Dutch and so many others. We're already very European in how we live and in our culture... if you go to Quebec City, you'd think you're in France.

Don't get me wrong, it wouldn't be easy - but it would give Europe a foot in North America and Canada a foot in Europe. It's basically a win/win for everyone! (Well, ok, maybe except the US...)

And it would end the decades long Danish/Canadian Whiskey War! :)

Before the UK joined the EU it was France who rejected them because they were too close to the USA.

That would be about the only reason I would NOT want Canada in the EU. Because of loyalties. The UK were obviously too close to the USA and not enough committed to mainland europe. The brexit is proof of their poor loyalty.

We dont need US lap dogs in the EU. But I would love a people and country like Canada in the EU, if they are committing to the EU family over the USA.

We have similar governments, similar ways of life and we by and large get along with each other.  And  as you stated in this video, we fought in the two world wars along side you.  This should be a no brainier.  Europe gets a friendly, reliable trading partner and Canada gets rid of the bullies of the world in the US.  Come on, Europe.  Just do it!!  You've got nothing to lose and so much to gain.

Canadian here. The polling which one of your pundits cites is nearly a week out of date.   The Conservative Party is only marginally polling ahead of the Liberals.  The resignation of Trudeau, and the prospect of having an accomplished Economist like Mark Carney at a time when the economy is the top priority is changing people's perspective overall.  We get tired of our Prime Ministers after roughly 8-10 years. Trudeau has had the same tenure as his predecessor, Conservative PM Harper.

CPC leader Poilievre has been denigrating our country for YEARS just to try get power for himself.  He's a career politician of over two decades, whereas Carney is an economist, much like PM Harper was during the Great Recession.  Party brand loyalty only goes so far when one compares the two of them.  Naturally, this does depend on the Liberal Party electing an outsider like Carney to leadership, but they'll lose the next election this year if they don't.

Canada should have thought about these ties long ago. Former PM Paul Martin was right to refuse to be drawn into US aggression against Iraq. What does Canada even have in common with a warmongering country who thinks gun ownership was a ""right"", but society is nothing more than selfish individuals, and the State has no duty to provide welfare for its people? I thought Canada was civilised, and civilised country would run away from the US.

Canadian here.  Canada loves the EU, but we are not European.  We are our own society and if we are to join any group, it should be CANZUK.  We are pulling away from the US and standing on our own two feet.  We need to stand with people who have the same parliamentary systems, share the same values and have a long history together.  We will trade with the EU.  We will defend the EU.  However, we will not join.  This idea will pass eventually and we will continue to be friends.

As a first-generation Canadian of German descent, I'll admit that I've considered this before. In fact, the last time was during Trump's first term. There are many reasons why Canada would make a better fit with the EU than as a 51st state. Demographically and culturally, more than half of all Canadians can trace their roots back to Europe. Socially and politically, we are also much more aligned with our European family than we are with our American neighbours. The benefits of EU membership are obvious to both Canada and the EU as well. The big problem is that our economy is so intricately entwined with the U.S. Our auto industry is a prime example of this, but there are others, including our transportation and energy infrastructure. Disentangling our economy from the U.S. wouldn't be easy, but it might prove worthwhile in the medium to long term, for our economic stability, our peace of mind and to preserve our sovereignty. For what it's worth, I'd be proud and honoured to consider myself a citizen of the EU, and similarly, I'd fight tooth and nail till my last dying breath to prevent my country from ever becoming the 51st state.

As a canadian, I fully support this. Unfortunately, the EUs' abilities to regulate these giant companies for anti consumer laws would threaten the US with us being so close. These companies would never allow it because Americans would see how good these laws are. It is why America hates our free Healthcare system. It is a constant thorn in the private healtcare companies in the US.

Canadian viewer. I would be surprised if Canada joined the EU. We are quite different politically. I would hope for a broader political economic treaty that the EU nations felt comfortable with.
Because many Europeans were insulted during the Brexit process,  the EU is the right thing for Europeans to be working on.

It's amazing to see the resilience of Bitcoin, even amidst the  U.S. regulatory standards. Trump victory created a major roles including a substantial fine and leadership changes, signal a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market.  Despite the impact on the financial sector and the crypto market, BTC seems to have emerged unscathed and is once again being hailed as a safe haven asset. This is a testament to the value and potential of this relatively new asset class. There hasn‚Äôt been a more better time to start trading, thanks to Aria Cookings Crypto strategy I have been able amass 19 BTC in three weeks of trading. Her expertise and knowledge of the crypto market are unparalleled and I feel incredibly lucky to have found her.

Europeans have universal health care! So does Canada!
Europeans have strict gun control! So does Canada!

- Germany receiving high quality and reliable Canadian softwood/oil/minerals and get back to the industrial heavyweight it was
- Britain once known for being the architects of the greatest fleets the world ever saw, get back to building vessels, Canada needs your expertise to open the arctic trade.

70,"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
71,as a Canadian I would support joining the EU or even strengthening the trade with the EU and other countries of the world. it would be a catastrophic mistake and extremely foolish to trust in the US again for anything like trade or military alliance.

95,That will be Canada's best course of action economically.
96,Canada in the EU would be be an excellent fit.
97,"Very well done, appreciate this video!"

104,"A Romanian here,  after travelling to Canada I can definetly see the strong European ties and this as a viable option."
105,That not even a question for Canadians. Would you like to cese to exist as a state or would you like to join the Erupean union? Even joining the EU on unfavourable terms is a universe better that cese to exist and be part of a thing like the US.
106,"I can't speak for the rest of Canada, but I personally am not at all opposed to the idea of joining the EU."
107,"As a Canadian all I have to say is Yes please!! s'il vous pla√Æt, merci. üá™üá∫üá®üá¶üá™üá∫"
108,As a Canadian I feel betrayed by our closest Ally. It‚Äôs time to move on and start over with our friends over seas. üá®üá¶Ô∏èüá™üá∫
109,"As a 62 year old Canadian it sickens me how the US has been treating us lately, so I welcome the idea of Canada becoming part of the EU."
110,"as a canadian, i'd love it if Canada joined the EU. even if that doesn't happen in full, i'd love it if we can become a part of the shengen area."
111,"Canada, and Canadians, love Europe...  We really should join, plus we have a land border with Denmark and are about 20km from France's land!"
112,"Canadian here....  
I will never bend the knee to a wannabe dictator and a convicted felon.
I perfer being part of the EU."
113,As an American‚Ä¶ I am sorry. This sucks and not all of us agree with everything going on. Please remember your humanity when dealing with my inhumane government. We are not them.
114,"Canadian here.  Regardless of any formal arrangements between nations, the recent hostility and nativism by the returning American President NECESSITATES increased economic activity between businesses in all nations who used to rely on selling anything to American businesses.   

That time has ended, and we all have to adjust. There really isn't any debate. That's happening right now."
115,This makes so much sense. As an European I've always had the impression that Canada's is culturally aligned with Europe while the US is not.
116,As a Canadian I love this idea 
117,"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
118,"The easy answer is yes Canada could join the EU, Why? Because Canada owns Vimy Ridge a territory in Europe,  European land equals European country, also Canada has strong European history and is part owned by European countries, also Europe is forever grateful for Canada's support in WW2 and Canada would not be denied membership for all these reasons, also Canada and the EU have very similar principals. Canada Joining the EU would be a bonus for both ends. I hope it happens."
119,"As a Canadian, I much rather have close trade relationships with EU than US at this point, even tough geography is a major challenge and I hope its feasible to do so. US proven itself to be an erratic, untrustworthy, even threatening neighbor, rather than an ally."
120,That would be awesome. These days it feels we have more in common with the Europeans than with the guys down south
121,Sure why not if the Us has no more interest in its allies we will have to adapt
122,You are very welcomed Canada !!! We share the same values !
123,"As a Canadian, I would support closer ties with the EU in whatever form that may take. Frankly, I believe European values align more closely with Canadian values than American ones."
124,"As a Canadian of European heritage and family, I would be thrilled to join the EU. However, The EU already has problems wrangling the member nations that it has and finding consensus. However, some kind of associate membership like several Scandinavian have would be viable. If I get a chance, I will vote for it.

I guarantee you this. A huge majority of Canadians if forced to choose between becoming an American state or an EU member, would choose the EU in a heartbeat. America is clinically insane."
125,"We welcome the Canadians in any way they prefer. Thanks Canada for liberating Amsterdam from the fascist, we will stand behind you to fight of the neofascists."
126,The US have been profiting from Canada for too long.
127,"As a Canadian, EU membership would be very welcome, and infinitely more welcome than US annexation."
128,That will the best economic policy for Canada.
129,"Well, we now share a border with Denmark, does that help our application at all?"
130,üá®üá¶üá™üá∫üá®üá¶üá™üá∫ Greetings from Toronto. I‚Äôm actually in favour of the idea
131,"I had never considered Canada as a potential EU candidate, but I am pleasantly surprised by the entire concept!"
132,"Absolutely.  It would solve Europe's energy needs, and raw materials.  We ship raw materials to the US and buy finished products back."
133,"Canadian here, seeing all the people from the EU welcoming Canada to join is heart warming.  Canada has been treated like garbage from our American ""Friends""."
134,"As  a Dane, I am sure Canada is most welcome in EU. What a brilliant idea - let us make a reality!"
135,As a Canadian I'd rather join the EU and maintain some sovereignty than be a lowly 51st state of a country busy surrendering its power all around the world.
136,Canada has technically a land border with Europe (Denmark) on Hans Island...
137,As a German who has spend a high school year in Canada I would absolutely LOVE for Canada to join the EU - Canada is such a great country and our values align so much! üá™üá∫üá®üá¶Ô∏è
138,5th generation Canadian here. I would chose becoming a part of the E.U. over a U.S. state without hesitationüá®üá¶
139,"As a Canadian,  I very much rather be part of the EU. Let's make this happen!!"
140,I‚Äôm Canadian. I would LOVE to join the EU.
141,"what Canada is learning is when you befriend a bully, it's only a matter of time until it turns against you."
142,We could start by cancelling the order for F-35s and instead buying from European suppliers.
143,I'm irish I would love Canada to join the EU and become our partners . That and people like Trump wouldn't be able to bully Canada with the EU behind it.
144,"Honestly, it's heartwarming and uplifting to hear this from our European friends."
145,As a proud Englishman who lives within the continent of Europe I would welcome Canada and it's wonderful people with open arms. Trump's America? No thanks.
146,"Canadian soldiers liberated my hometown in WW2. We owe them. If it was up to me, they are welcome in the EU."
147,the truth is canada would definitely be a boon for the european union and that would also enable europe to take an opportunity of trade of the usmca with mexico also
148,"Great idea...
Canada and the EU."
149,"As a Canadian who is reading comments from other Canadians saying they would be 'open to joining the EU', I urge them to reconsider!
Joining the EU is not a 'party' and you need to remember that there are 27 other countries that will have to vote each time there is a decision to be made
You can't just do what you want
We are 'strong and free' right now as we are, with our own rules and we don't have to answer to anyone
The EU are our friends and they are great, but not for Canada to join
Let's just keep the great relationship we have with them and make it even stronger!"
150,Im Canadian and I would 100% vote to join the EU!
151,"I 1000% agree, i would like this so much!"
152,"Pierre Trudeau mused about joining the EEC back in the 1970s...to avoid becoming overly dependent on the US ironically. Geography aside, Canada would be much more at home, if it could be nestled up off the coast of Norway."
153,"American here who never voted for trump, apologizing for his words and behaviors to Canada, Mexico, Panama and ALL of Europe! "
154,Joining the EU would make america cry 
155,Joining EU is a great idea. Many European families already live in Canada that have dual citizenship.
156,"As a Canadian, I would love it, if Canada joined EU."
157,As a Canadian I would welcome being part of the EU. Our values and way of thinking is more aligned to the EU than the US.
158,"Canadian here, PLEASE GOD LET US IN"
159,"Canada-EU: great for trade, climate change, immigration, UN, WHO, international justice, peace missions, space mission, technology, research, healthcare, agriculture‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the list goes on. Great defining moment in Geopolitics! Hats off!"
160,"Canada should definitely get much closer with EU, if not join EU. Canada is closer to Europe culturally and politically than to USA anyway."
161,"deeper EU/Canada would be great partnership that would hurt US and Russia

btw just rename EU to ETU- European trade union (which it actually is) and pretty much anyone can join"
162,Canada we love you üá™üá∫
163,I'm a swede and obviously have no problem with Canada joining the EU.
164,"I'm Canadian and I see our future being with Europe, asides from Hungary our values are a lot closer."
165,"as a european to all canadians: 
we have a saying - ""you can't choose your neighbour but you can choose your friends!"""
166,"As a dual citizen of Canada, Portuguese/Canadian I‚Äôm all in to join the EU"
167,Man that would be a dream. As a Canadian I would LOVE to distance from the US and be one with Europe. Open borders!
168,I would vote for that.  I have always felt Canadians  were more closely related to Europeans than Americans.  AND we still get to be Canadians.
169,"As a portuguese who's been to Canada and fell in love with its land and open sky spirit, i would love the chance to see Europe grown closer to our Canadian friends and rich culture. Surely Canada is the most european north American  culture."
170,"Being a citizen of an EU country is worth $1,000,000. Being a US citizen isn‚Äôt worth 10 cents."
171,As a french I would be very happy if Canada joined the EU
172,"As an Albertan, a Canadian I vote for it "
173,I am German and love Canada. The Idea of Canada joining the EU is a bit insane but would be the greatest thing to happen in a long time.
174,"I think the best thing for Canada is to diversify its trading partners. Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia..."
175,"Yes. Please. As a European, I hope so."
176,"As a Proud Canadian, I would vote to join the EU in a heartbeat."
177,As a Canadian I think it‚Äôs a really good idea to become a member of the EU. The world has gotten a lot closer and smaller as the years have past. We have a lot more to gain being a member of the EU.
178,"As a Turkish, I'm convinced that even Japan could become an EU member :) BTW, good luck, best time for Canada and EU collaboration and both have common values. Full support for this.
Ps. Turkiye will never become an EU country with the value missmatch (politics, economy and such) but wish good things for your neighbors and collaborate. Especially during ongoing trade wars and geopolitical tensions."
179,We should join forces.
180,"as a french looking in, i feel canadians have kept their european heritage much better than usa culture; i would enjoy canda as a closer allie in many ways; i also have some great Canadian friends, the connection is there between canada and france :) bought maple sirup 2 days ago as a sweet gesture of support to canada vs usa ;)"
181,Canada doesn‚Äôt need to join anything. The country needs to diversify its commercial partners and build good relationships with them.
182,"As a Canadian, I'm down! let's do that!"
183,Why not?
184,"Hmm, as a Canadian, I could get behind this? Who are we thinking for Eurovision 2026? Celine Dion? Shawn Mendes?"
185,"As european guy,  I would be very happy having Canada in EU. I stand with Canadians"
186,"As a Canadian, l would be very interested in learning more about this."
187,The worst thing in your life that you can have is a bad neighbor.
188,Can Minnesota Join Canada? Please
189,"With trade tariff turmoil, Canada must rethink its reliance on the U.S. It's time to diversify our trade relationships and explore opportunities elsewhere. Strengthening ties with other countries will protect our economy and ensure stability, reducing overdependence on a single, unpredictable partner. The world is full of possibilities."
190,"Henry Kissinger once say, ""To be an enemy of the US is dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal"""
191,As a Canadian and an European I am for it.
192,As a Canadian I totally support this idea!
193,finally some good sounding news
194,"As an Englishman, I am even more jealous and disgusted with Brexit!!  As Europe prosper, we fall further and further behind. And it looks more and more likely that we will be the lapdog to the newest oligarchy, America."
195,"As a Danish citizen I would welcome Canada, and I too would prefer EU to buy oil and gas from Canada not from the USA."
196,Canadian here. Would definitely vote to join the EU. Would never join the US.
197,"As a Canadian, we should sincerely look into what's required to join the EU.  I think it would be a win-win."
198,"Our history says yes. German, French, England, Scotch,Irish Ukraine ,and it goes on"
199,"As both, Canadian and European citizen, I see a great match. Perfect complementarities."
200,"As a Canadian, I would love to be able to join the EU.
Realistically though, I doubt it would happen. 
Would be beneficial to both sides though and we have more in common with Europe than the US."
201,"I am a Canadian and would never want to become the 51st state.  I would, however, welcome becoming part of the EU as I have European family and feel more European than American in my mindset and values."
202,As a dual British/Canadian citizen I'd be both amused and pleased if I got my EU access back by CANADA joining
203,"Canada joining the EU just makes SO much sense. We're a huge country - the size of Europe - with a small population.  We're one of the most ethnically diverse nations on the planet. Our TWO national languages are English and French, but we speak Hindi, Cantonese, Mandarin, German, Dutch and so many others. We're already very European in how we live and in our culture... if you go to Quebec City, you'd think you're in France.

Don't get me wrong, it wouldn't be easy - but it would give Europe a foot in North America and Canada a foot in Europe. It's basically a win/win for everyone! (Well, ok, maybe except the US...)

And it would end the decades long Danish/Canadian Whiskey War! :)"
204,This is brilliant!
205,My sister and her family are Canadian.   I may be moving there as living here has created a very high degree of stress with all the authoritarian chaos
206,"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
207,"Never thought of that as an option.  Wonder how it would work? Hey, we use the metric system too."
208,Would be a very good idea actually.
209,If Canada became an EU that would be a win/win situation.
210,"Before the UK joined the EU it was France who rejected them because they were too close to the USA.

That would be about the only reason I would NOT want Canada in the EU. Because of loyalties. The UK were obviously too close to the USA and not enough committed to mainland europe. The brexit is proof of their poor loyalty.

We dont need US lap dogs in the EU. But I would love a people and country like Canada in the EU, if they are committing to the EU family over the USA."
211,Canadian here - would love this!
212,"Canadian guy here.  l don't see a single issue with us joining the EU,  We've  already got the Queen on our $20 bill and all of our coins.  And it wasn't all that long ago that we were still technically under England's rule.  l think it was roughly 40 years ago.  We have similar governments, similar ways of life and we by and large get along with each other.  And  as you stated in this video, we fought in the two world wars along side you.  This should be a no brainier.  Europe gets a friendly, reliable trading partner and Canada gets rid of the bullies of the world in the US.  Come on, Europe.  Just do it!!  You've got nothing to lose and so much to gain."
213,I'm all in. Let's do this!!!
214,As a person from Demark. You are very wellcome
215,OMG!  my life long dream of living in Canada actually could become true! üá®üá¶üá©üá™üá®üá¶
216,"As a Canadian, anyone but the USA "
217,Canada and EU (Denmark) share a land border so it would be natural to trade with neighbouring countries.
218,Not the 51th ones....but in friendship with Europe. Warmly welcomed Canada
219,Please let Australia and New Zealand join the EU too!
220,Canadian's have more of a connection to the European community. They share similar values.
221,Canada would be most welcome in the EU.
222,"As a Canadian, yes please! My wife and I are Registered nurses, and have been discussing immigrating to europe anyway. We've been learning german, french, and danish in preperation."
223,Imagine first canada and then mexico joining Europe 
224,Canada must file the Paperwork to Join the European union immediately.
225,I hope Canada does join the EU!!
226,Weirdly makes sense
227,"Yes, please join the European Union and add Canada to the Schengen area(free movement of people between countries)"
228,Yes !  Bring Canada in !
229,It would be absolutely appropriate for Canada to become the 28th member of EU
230,"As an European, i will totally LOVE IT if Canada will join us!!!"
231,Atlantic Canadian here.  Canada wants nothing to do with the US as far as becoming a state.  Nice to see the nice comments from the EU although pretty sure the majority would not want to be part of the EU either.  We would be happy trade more with our EU friends.  Canadians just want to be Canadian.  :)
232,Please make it happen
233,"I have been to Canada as an European, Montreal and Quebec in general is very European looking. I would welcome Canada to join the EU or become a close partner at least."
234,"Canada, Australia, EU, New Zealand, UK and Mexico should prioritise free trade. Trumps isolation will make us all poorer."
235,"Let start with expanding trade relation between Canada & the EU, as a dane I strongly recommend it - if Canada wants to join the EU = OK with me"
236,"Canada joining the EU would be a mega game changer. As America crumbles, Canada joining the EU would demonstrate there is an alternative to the American world order. Of course let's not forget the irony of Canada joining the EU after the UK left. Fkn poetic."
237,Canada should join EU to against American tyranny
238,"As a Canadian I‚Äôd be more comfortable joining the EU alongside the UK, because then we‚Äôd be partnered with them and France and it would feel like the family was all back together again.
I thought the UK would have sought greater ties with us after Brexit, but I was mistaken ü´§"
239,"I love how they will discuss ""all sorts of things""."
240,"As a Canadian,  I'd be happy to join the EU."
241,This guy litterally looks like the Canadian stereotype from south park
242,This is going to make it even more funny when American tv show characters ‚Äúvisit Europe‚Äù.
243,As a Canadian I would love to be member of the EU
244,"America would hate this. I love it lol. At least good to throw out in the media to keep America on their toes. I love that the EU would pretend for a second that they wouldn‚Äôt want Canada. If Canada was a tenth of the land mass with a tenth of the resources, our location alone is a gigantic benefit.and we bring zero drama as far as wars and enemies. If the EU doesn‚Äôt want Canada than they don‚Äôt want anyone new."
245,"Canadian here. The polling which one of your pundits cites is nearly a week out of date.   The Conservative Party is only marginally polling ahead of the Liberals.  The resignation of Trudeau, and the prospect of having an accomplished Economist like Mark Carney at a time when the economy is the top priority is changing people's perspective overall.  We get tired of our Prime Ministers after roughly 8-10 years. Trudeau has had the same tenure as his predecessor, Conservative PM Harper.

CPC leader Poilievre has been denigrating our country for YEARS just to try get power for himself.  He's a career politician of over two decades, whereas Carney is an economist, much like PM Harper was during the Great Recession.  Party brand loyalty only goes so far when one compares the two of them.  Naturally, this does depend on the Liberal Party electing an outsider like Carney to leadership, but they'll lose the next election this year if they don't."
246,"This Canadian would much rather join the EU than keep ANY ties to the unreliable, duplicitous, and belligerent USA. It's not something that I'd considered before, but it would make a lot of sense, especially ideologically."
247,"Canada is part of the british commonwealth. UK that sits in Europe, so CLOSE ENOUGH"
248,"Why shouldn't the Canadians join the EU? No reason at all. Go for it! (It will royally tick off Trump, which is a bonus)

As an American, I'm very sorry for the mess we've put the Canadians and Mexico in. Slightly over 50% of us DIDN'T vote for the menace-in-chief. I hope you'll forgive us when we come to our senses."
249,I would love to have Canada in the Union! Love form üá©üá™ üá™üá∫
250,"French Her, Been on reddit reading about that since Trump talked about Tarrifs prior to winning.
I really think we should study the question.

I think Canada should ask for membership just even to send a message to Trump"
251,We share a tiny border with Denmark! Let's sign up!!!!! 
252,"Canada should have thought about these ties long ago. Former PM Paul Martin was right to refuse to be drawn into US aggression against Iraq. What does Canada even have in common with a warmongering country who thinks gun ownership was a ""right"", but society is nothing more than selfish individuals, and the State has no duty to provide welfare for its people? I thought Canada was civilised, and civilised country would run away from the US."
253,"Canada, we will be happy if you join us in the EU  from Belgium."
254,This is the best ridiculous idea i have heard in years. I would love if it were to happen.
255,"As a Canadian, all I can say is , ‚ÄúAbout time!‚Äù  It won‚Äôt be easy but it is possible to move away from needing the USA."
256,"You welcome you, Canada."
257,"If the Canary Islands are part of Spain, Australia takes part in Eurovisi√≥n and Turkey might also be part of the EU despite more than 85% of it's territory is in Asia, why can't Canada join the EU?"
258,I actually LOVE this idea
259,CA  EU
260,"Canadian here.  Canada loves the EU, but we are not European.  We are our own society and if we are to join any group, it should be CANZUK.  We are pulling away from the US and standing on our own two feet.  We need to stand with people who have the same parliamentary systems, share the same values and have a long history together.  We will trade with the EU.  We will defend the EU.  However, we will not join.  This idea will pass eventually and we will continue to be friends."
261,As a Canadian I would love to have free movement within the EU and having them freely moving in Canada. Also we are trusted partners. We can rely on eachother.
262,"Canadian here (Toronto) I am very interested in this. I have been to Europe before including Barcelona, Spain last year. I would love to return!"
263,Canadian here! I‚Äôd support joining the EU
264,I'm a sad American.  I hope the rest of the world realized that DT does not have anything close to a mandate.  I cannot blame Canada or the EU for breaking off ties with us.
265,That would be great to have Canada in the EU 
266,I'm Canadian and I would love better access to access to European EVs
267,"As a first-generation Canadian of German descent, I'll admit that I've considered this before. In fact, the last time was during Trump's first term. There are many reasons why Canada would make a better fit with the EU than as a 51st state. Demographically and culturally, more than half of all Canadians can trace their roots back to Europe. Socially and politically, we are also much more aligned with our European family than we are with our American neighbours. The benefits of EU membership are obvious to both Canada and the EU as well. The big problem is that our economy is so intricately entwined with the U.S. Our auto industry is a prime example of this, but there are others, including our transportation and energy infrastructure. Disentangling our economy from the U.S. wouldn't be easy, but it might prove worthwhile in the medium to long term, for our economic stability, our peace of mind and to preserve our sovereignty. For what it's worth, I'd be proud and honoured to consider myself a citizen of the EU, and similarly, I'd fight tooth and nail till my last dying breath to prevent my country from ever becoming the 51st state."
268,Canada a member of the EU? YES!!
269,"trump is the best thing that happned to trudeau, trudeau is gaining some popularity over this."
270,"As a Filipino-Canadian, i am excited for this possibility to have access to europe than america. USA politics is too bipolar lately. I dont want to be in a shaky relationship with someone bipolar lol. As a healthcare worker i would be so delighted to even possibly work in spain i have always wanted to visit there."
271,"I'd be more open to EU than the 51st state but I think there's more of a chance of a Western Alliance with Canada, Mexico and picking up a few states that no longer want to be part of the US, lol."
272,"Imagine wanting to make Canada your new state and you make them be in EU, now.. lol"
273,You know what !? I THINK  I could like that proposition.  USA is treating us very badly actually... üá®üá¶
274,Being EU would be great. To be considered american is probably the worse thing I can imagine.
275,"Canadian here, I would love to join the EU. Please make that happen!"
276,"If Canada can - why not Japan ? 

How much more polarisation do we need in Euro Parliament until we realise that reforming the decision-making should be our priority, as opposed to enlargement?"
277,"This is cool. So, Dutch put bid for in to purchase California, and Canada joining EU?! Nice"
278,I've always wished I could have free movement in Europe. That would be amazing.
279,Canada owns ground in France so technically European :)
280,Alberta is going LOVE this 
281,"As a small business owner in Newfoundland, Canada, I love this idea. Been following European events for a while now and the way the E.U. seems to operate makes a lot more sense that this BS the southern pumpkin is attempting"
282,"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
283,Wrong about Poilievre being heavily favoured.  Not since Mark Carney put his hat in the ring.  His coziness with Trump turned out to be Kryptonite with Canadians looking ahead for the next four years.
284,"As a Canadian, I would love to join the EU. Values, Security and History would make us a good fit. You have people, we have land, marriage made in heaven."
285,üá™üá∫üá®üá¶
286,"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
287,Sure! Give me that EU passport so I can get TF out of Canada üá®üá¶ 
288,Please yes !!! Canada - EU  
289,"I'm HATING that Canadian premieres are down in Washington to consult with their American colleagues and talking about our integrated economies.  NO, I want us to move away from the U.S.  I am sooooooooooo sick and tired of their attitude and their drama and how unfair they are while trying to paint themselves to be the victims.  It's exhausting!!"
290,"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
291,"Dear Californians, that's all of you. . Imagine being able to live and work anywhere in Canada or Europe."
292,Canadians need to learn to say AluminIUM! 
293,"Saint-Pierre & Miquelon is France and in Canada. Clipperton Island is France and in Mexico. 

Canada & Mexico

Join EUROPEAN UNION/NATO NOW"
294,"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
295,"Canada, welcome to the EU! We don't want to have anything to do with the skitsofrenian Trumpland."
296,üá®üá¶üá™üá∫I love my Europe brothers and sisters
297,"Yes, please.  We would love to join the EU!  We have shared borders with Denmark and technically very close geographically close to France."
298,Love the idea
299,I hope the Canadians look for WHAT not to do in an election. Trump is a total disaster and he is/was a conservative.. he turned out to be a fascists.
300,Should just join BRICS and lean into the conflict haha
301,Please lets join the EU!
302,"The last thing Canada ""needs"" is more people."
303,Why does trump think the US is great without their alies?
304,Canadian here. Yes please!
305,Yes to EU‚Ä¶no way USA
306,"Canada EU Partnership   are more Economic  advantage for   than USA . unfortunately  ,  most of EU member are NATO  membership  may to retiming NATO and EU  Relations"
307,"As a canadian, I fully support this. Unfortunately, the EUs' abilities to regulate these giant companies for anti consumer laws would threaten the US with us being so close. These companies would never allow it because Americans would see how good these laws are. It is why America hates our free Healthcare system. It is a constant thorn in the private healtcare companies in the US."
308,Make Europe Canada Collaboration Awesome
309,Do it!...join the EU!...You can take the place of the UK!
310,"This was super helpful, thanks!"
311,"Canadian viewer. I would be surprised if Canada joined the EU. We are quite different politically. I would hope for a broader political economic treaty that the EU nations felt comfortable with.
Because many Europeans were insulted during the Brexit process,  the EU is the right thing for Europeans to be working on. 
DW is a great channel."

25% tariff paid to the US is going to trickle down to a 25% price increase to the American consumer. This is basically a 25% increase in sales tax that consumers will pay. Meanwhile, the working person foots the bill. Typical.

EDIT - a few days later, people seem to enjoy interacting with this comment, but I've thought about it, and I decided that we can't let a politican divide people, so I am not going to 'boycott' American stuff, but I am going to give preference to stuff and cultures from other countries around the world, so Japan, India, Turkey, Sweden, Belgium, Potugal, Morocco, Israel (the ones who are peace loving and wish to live with the Palestinians), Palestine (same thing here), Egypt, Ukraine, and Austria, we're all gonna get closer and become friends while donald trump isolates his country

It long over due that we should drop the inter-provincial trade barriers. Then get our oil flowing east/west. Most importantly, we need to open new markets up with the rest of the world who wants our trade. Trump can go sit on a thumb tag and twist on it.

Imposing a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports could backfire on the U.S. by raising costs for businesses and consumers, triggering retaliatory tariffs, and straining trade relations. Since industries like automotive, agriculture, and manufacturing rely on North American supply chains, higher import costs will increase prices, inflation, and job losses. The U.S. auto industry, for example, will face higher production costs, making vehicles more expensive and less competitive. Canada and Mexico will likely retaliate with tariffs on key U.S. exports, hurting American farmers and manufacturers who depend on these markets. Declining sales in soybeans, corn, dairy, and beef could lead to financial losses and farm closures. These tariffs could also damage diplomatic relations, undermining the USMCA and pushing Canada and Mexico to strengthen trade with Europe and China, reducing U.S. influence. Politically, rising costs and job losses could spark a public backlash, pressuring policymakers to reverse the decision. While intended to strengthen the U.S. economy, these tariffs may ultimately do more harm than good.

What BBC gets completely wrong is that tariffs are payed by the IMPORTER not the seller. So when those cowboy boots are imported the importer pays the tariffs and then have to increase the sales price by the same amount to keep the same profit = the sales price will increase. 
Importers would never ‚Äúcover‚Äù that cost without increasing the price equivalent toward retailers.
The best thing Canada could do is to NOT add any tariffs. The result would be huge increase of cross border shopping because everything would be so much cheaper in Canada. Then the individuals of course risk to be charged tariffs at the border crossing on their way home again‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve been in the import business since 2009.

it doesn't hurt to punish China, a country that makes a lot fo goods that the USA depends on? are you kidding me? Tarrifs are essentially an import duty that will make those goods expensive for the American buyer. If the US cannot replace all the goods its increasing tariffs on in America then the companies making, it is the US consumer who is at the receiving end of this bad deal. How is this not hurting America?

1 Canadian buys 4 times as much American goods as 1 American buys Canadian goods.
They buy very little from Canada, but Canada buys all their stuff from the USA.
They think there is a trade imbalance between a country of 40 million, patronizing a country of 335 million, and only being around $50B behind them in patronization.
The truth is Canada supports the American economy and the only thing Americans buy from Canada is the energy and raw materials they need to make their own industries successful.
It's time to expand Canada's trading relationships.

As an American who's grandfather fought for this nation, it's bewildering to see the direction we have taken. During Donald Trump's first term, I hoped he wouldn't do much damage to the nation and leave the country similar to how Obama left it. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise. At the end of Trump's first term, I hoped we could have a peaceful transition of power to the Biden administration and forget about the worst presidents we have ever had. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise.  When the election ballets opened, I hoped Trump would lose in an electoral landslide. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise. On inauguration day, I was hopeful he would be all-talk like his last presidential term and allow us to mend relations. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise. Now, it is 2/2/25, and as a  proud 3rd generation American I refuse to underestimate this man or his idiotic supporters. I hope they get exactly what they want, a presidency where Donald Trump erects a failing nation through every policy proposed. I hope I can be fortunate enough to see the remnants of a once peaceful and powerful nation rebuilt atop the ruins of a nation led by Donald Trump.

The first thing we must do is reduce the number of franchises of all American brands. For example, McDonald‚Äôs has more than a thousand locations in Alberta and nearly a hundred in Calgary, if not more. If we reduce them to a quarter of their current number, we can give local restaurants a better chance to earn money. The same applies to Starbucks, Costco, KFC, and other major chains.

Additionally, we should focus on manufacturing most of our essential items locally. I still remember how difficult it was to provide Canadians with N95 masks during COVID-19. I cannot accept that a first-world country like Canada is unable to manufacture most of its necessities domestically.

Imposing tariffs on Mexico and China is understandable. But imposing tariffs on Canada is a very shortsighted act. Canada is the US's closest ally in America. They have been having a brotherly relationship over the years. It's like one brother suddenly turns his back to the other. This act might damage the US Canada relationship irreversibly. The only way out for Canada is to look for new markets. I am pretty sure Canada will come out of this difficult situation soon. My heart is always with Canada.

Canada has a trade imbalance with the US because we sell too much energy.
 Retaliation to US tariffs.
 The economy is transformed energy;
1) Proclaim the Emergency Measures Act;
2) Reduce by 25% the sales of electricity from Quebec, Ontario and other provinces if there are any;
3) Reduce by 25% the sales of oil and refined products;
4) Reduce by 25% the sales of natural gas;
5) Reduce by 25% the sales of uranium;
6 ) Reduce by 25% the sales of natural water;

The US is likely to face challenges under the Trump administration, leading to other nations distancing themselves from it. This could affect how freely Americans can travel abroad. It's a wake-up call for Americans to realize that no country can thrive in isolation before it's too late.

Let‚Äôs face Trump isn‚Äôt an economist he is full of bluster, he won‚Äôt be happy till he screws the world economy. Whilst he won‚Äôt suffer economically personally, low income Americans will. I hope Canada and Mexico start more trade with the EU and vice versa. The sooner he makes America a pariah state the better, then maybe the American people will realise what a mistake they make voting him into office.

If Quebec would allow a natural gas pipeline to cross into Nova Scotia, we could compress and sell it to Europe to offset Russian gas; oil and gas pipelines mean we could export to Europe via east coast and Asia via the west coast and not sell any oil or gas to the U>S. at discounted prices.

The main gist of his strategy is not to increase the coffers through tariffs, but to use a carrot & stick approach to entice/coerce businesses to setup shop in USA. One interesting thing which I don't hear much is changing of attitudes to make the workforce more attractive, the return to office is probably just one step in the entire scheme of productivity.

75,I am an American. I STAND WITH CANADA!!
76,"I'm Canadian. Think this might be a good thing for Canada. We are too tethered to the USA. If anything, it's the USA that hasn't been treating us fairly, even under Biden. It long over due that we should drop the inter-provincial trade barriers. Then get our oil flowing east/west.

80,If you think Canada's taken advantage of the United States as he says it is a big fat joke I think it's the other way around
81,Was someone making pig noises in the background during the first part of this video?! 
82,"Imposing a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports could backfire on the U.S. by raising costs for businesses and consumers, triggering retaliatory tariffs, and straining trade relations. Since industries like automotive, agriculture, and manufacturing rely on North American supply chains, higher import costs will increase prices, inflation, and job losses. The U.S. auto industry, for example, will face higher production costs, making vehicles more expensive and less competitive. Canada and Mexico will likely retaliate with tariffs on key U.S. exports, hurting American farmers and manufacturers who depend on these markets. Declining sales in soybeans, corn, dairy, and beef could lead to financial losses and farm closures. These tariffs could also damage diplomatic relations, undermining the USMCA and pushing Canada and Mexico to strengthen trade with Europe and China, reducing U.S. influence. Politically, rising costs and job losses could spark a public backlash, pressuring policymakers to reverse the decision. While intended to strengthen the U.S. economy, these tariffs may ultimately do more harm than good."
83,"As an American citizen that works in finance and is already struggling with medical debt, I am upset by this. However, it was amusing to watch my racist MAGA coworkers have a meltdown today. Even my conservative coworkers who all are traders know this is bad."

88,"The more people boycotting the USA worldwide, the better."
89,Does this mean I'm about to pay an outrageous price for an avocado to my nachos? hell naw!
90,"Help. I'm a sane, rational, educated person trapped in America."
91,Isn‚Äôt Mexico and Canada meant to be allies. Why are we running high tariffs on allied nations? I don‚Äôt get this.
92,Why do you not explain that illegal immigrants and fentanyl entering US from Canada is a trickle? And why don't you lay any blame on the fentanyl users in the US? And why don't you mention the fact that the US allows guns into our countries resulting in criminals committing murders here?
93,This is the reason why the majority of voters chose trump... They want tariffs.
94,Canada needs to finds more respectful business partners than the US. Canada should apply for BRICS.
95,HE'S HURTING THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS MORE THEN ANYTHING ELSE AND HE DOESN'T KNOW
96,Canadiens will band together. Americans won‚Äôt.
97,"Its amazing to me that the US president understands basically nothing about international trade yet is allowed to unilaterally do things like this. How is the rest of the US government not pushing back on this obviously awful, ruinous plan? What the hell is going on?"
98,I love the way the commentators on the news say....MR TRUMP!....in a real childish manner haha
99,Canada and Mexico WIN BIG.  #together
100,"Give the American people what they want Trump, higher cost on consumer goods. This IS what they want because they voted for you."
101,"What BBC gets completely wrong is that tariffs are payed by the IMPORTER not the seller. So when those cowboy boots are imported the importer pays the tariffs and then have to increase the sales price by the same amount to keep the same profit = the sales price will increase. 
Importers would never ‚Äúcover‚Äù that cost without increasing the price equivalent toward retailers.
The best thing Canada could do is to NOT add any tariffs. The result would be huge increase of cross border shopping because everything would be so much cheaper in Canada. Then the individuals of course risk to be charged tariffs at the border crossing on their way home again‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve been in the import business since 2009."
102,"Europe 
"" Did we just become best friends?
Canada 
"" Yep"""
103,"Canada-25%
Mexico-25%
China- 3%.......
President Musk knows who butters his parsnips."
104,The Whole world (almost) is behind Canada and Mexico on tariffs. Which country will be next.
105,"No comments from Russia, just a big smile. "
106,Tariffs invite reciprocal tariffs so the orange man is running out of juice.
107,The American People that did not vote for him will be the ones who also have to suffer from his ridiculous proclamations and mandates.
108,Reminder this person bankrupted 3 casinos. America is next. trump can't get a loan for a car with his credit.
109,"it doesn't hurt to punish China, a country that makes a lot fo goods that the USA depends on? are you kidding me? Tarrifs are essentially an import duty that will make those goods expensive for the American buyer. If the US cannot replace all the goods its increasing tariffs on in America then the companies making, it is the US consumer who is at the receiving end of this bad deal. How is this not hurting America?"
110,Mark my words ‚Äúthe market will see no effect from tariffs‚Äù.
111,"Walmart, Amazon and Trump support? Qardun token is going to 500x... I just hope there is not too many insiders"

115,"Hahahah running his country to the floor, good job trumpster!"
116,"What importer would absorb a 25% increase in prices instead of passing it to the consumer? that's right, nobody who wants to stay in business"
117,"""Firmly believes that he is the worlds best negotiator"" ... May God help us in this time of utter idiocy."
118,Childish greed.
119,"He does understand Americans will have to pay the tax, right?"
120,Is Trump going to stop selling Chinese made merchandise ? I doubt this hypocrite will  !
121,"When Mexico stops sending oil and Canada stops sending oil and electricity, I bet trump will be on the phone begging for forgiveness since the U.S. don‚Äôt have the refineries to use our own oil that we have"
122,Canada! We Europeans are waiting for you to join! We have more things in common than with the USA
123,"25% tariff on Mexico and  25% on Canada, 10% tariff tax on china for sending us some fentanyl."

They buy very little from Canada, but Canada buys all their stuff from the USA.
They think there is a trade imbalance between a country of 40 million, patronizing a country of 335 million, and only being around $50B behind them in patronization.
The truth is Canada supports the American economy and the only thing Americans buy from Canada is the energy and raw materials they need to make their own industries successful.

177,"As an American who's grandfather fought for this nation, it's bewildering to see the direction we have taken. During Donald Trump's first term, I hoped he wouldn't do much damage to the nation and leave the country similar to how Obama left it. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise. At the end of Trump's first term, I hoped we could have a peaceful transition of power to the Biden administration and forget about the worst presidents we have ever had. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise.  When the election ballets opened, I hoped Trump would lose in an electoral landslide. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise. On inauguration day, I was hopeful he would be all-talk like his last presidential term and allow us to mend relations. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise. Now, it is 2/2/25, and as a  proud 3rd generation American I refuse to underestimate this man or his idiotic supporters. I hope they get exactly what they want, a presidency where Donald Trump erects a failing nation through every policy proposed. I hope I can be fortunate enough to see the remnants of a once peaceful and powerful nation rebuilt atop the ruins of a nation led by Donald Trump."
178,"The first thing we must do is reduce the number of franchises of all American brands. For example, McDonald‚Äôs has more than a thousand locations in Alberta and nearly a hundred in Calgary, if not more. If we reduce them to a quarter of their current number, we can give local restaurants a better chance to earn money. The same applies to Starbucks, Costco, KFC, and other major chains.

Additionally, we should focus on manufacturing most of our essential items locally. I still remember how difficult it was to provide Canadians with N95 masks during COVID-19. I cannot accept that a first-world country like Canada is unable to manufacture most of its necessities domestically."

227,Imposing tariffs on Mexico and China is understandable. But imposing tariffs on Canada is a very shortsighted act. Canada is the US's closest ally in America. They have been having a brotherly relationship over the years. It's like one brother suddenly turns his back to the other. This act might damage the US Canada relationship irreversibly. The only way out for Canada is to look for new markets. I am pretty sure Canada will come out of this difficult situation soon. My heart is always with Canada.

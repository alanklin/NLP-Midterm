President Donald Trump ordered his administration to consider imposing reciprocal tariffs on numerous trading partners, raising the prospect of a wider campaign against a global system he complains is tilted against the US. Trump wants studies done by April 1, then he could take immediate action. Michael McKee and Shawn Donnan report.

This helps us how? Each country we have bullied?  China is already there. They strategically planned ahead. Its amazing how many countries they are helping. They expanded a port in Mexico that has a direct route to China. Built a speed rail train in Africa. China has made friends and gotten new resources.

You know, the problem is really not about having a moron for president (though that, in and of itself, can present problems).  After all, not every president has had a high level of expertise in business and economics.  The problem is having a egomaniacal malignant narcissist for president who thinks he actually knows better than everyone else and therefore won't take advice from the people who DO have a high level of expertise in all of these different areas.

So, the prices might go up in the short term... and Trump said that once prices go up they are difficult to bring back down.  What is it that the American public doesn't understand.  You might want to read ""Tariffs for Dummies"".

If the rest of the world imposes tariffs on the US, expect Chump to whine... no favours, no fortune for Donald J Chump.  Everyone should stay united until this is done.

To add, VAT tax is paid by everyone, had nothing to do with where it came from.  But then again, this is Donald Chump.

You need to clarify that VAT is applied to all products both foreign and domestic so it is not like a tariff that is only applied to foreign products.  So VAT is not aimed at the US products.  If the US wants to put a VAT on all products in the US then that can be compared to VAT.  But for someone like the UK to take off VAT from US products would put their own products at a disadvantage.  So it is not going to happen.  The EU and other countries can either accept the tariffs that Trump imposes or retaliate.  But they are not about to lift their VATs on American products.

Is there no one intelligent and brave enough to advise him that tariffs will hurt the end consumers the most. Really wondering if Trump and his team actually understands the difference between Exports and Imports and how tariffs actually works and who gets affected in the end. Because if he really knew about tariffs, he definitely wouldn't have imposed it in the first place. Period

>Keep the following in mind. These tariffs are an expensive distraction. The real problem is the US national debt. In the year 2000 the debt stood at $5.0 Trillion US but now it stands at over $36.0 Trillion US. In four years, that debt will zoom over $40.0 Trillion US. With the hidden cost of the tariff move that debt could easily hit $44.0 Trillion US in four years.
>The only way to slow and then reverse that climb in debt is to grow the economy, increasing the GDP faster than the increases in the debt. The ratio of Debt/GDP is around 125 % and the only way to get this down below 100% is by increasing the GDP. These tariffs will do the opposite. Turning against the two allies, Canada and Mexico, will just accelerate the rise in debt while diminishing the rise in GDP of the US.
Does anyone in Washington not see this?

I hope Trump forces other countries to reciprocate the US de minimis rate on US goods via the mail.  That would be great for consumers around the world and reduce prices.

America has the lowest trade/gdp ratio of any developed nation.  You could totally cease all trade and the economy would get better for the average American.  It's only the super rich that don't want tariffs.

Here is the problem for Americans who do no research nor understand tariffs in the first place. 90% of what the US imports from Canada is used to go into a finished product it is not a consumable product. Whereas a bulk of what Canada imports from the US is consumer based goods for the buyer. Like Heinz, booze, etc. Now that Canada, the EU and other countries who the mutt in charge is targeting are just going to buy locally made food, booze, consumables and travel locally or anywhere but the US there will be major disruption to the US economy. That's the difference and that's where it is going to be devastating for American jobs...

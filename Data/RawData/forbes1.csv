Well, I have bad news for Trump: I and millions of other Europeans will be actively boycotting American products if and when he applies tariffs to the EU, which will invariably hurt US consumers far more than us. Why? Because US consumers appear to have a marked preference for European quality consumer products, namely German-made cars, as opposed to those made in the land of Uncle Sam, which nobody really wants to buy on this side of the pond, with the exception of Tesla, at least for the time being. I would also draw his attention to the dire consequences witnessed after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930) was implemented. Think again, Mr. Trump.

Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome. You tried this stunt 4 years ago Donnie, and the EU targeted retaliatory tarriffs that would effect your red state base the most. Tennessee whiskey, Harley Davidsons, etc., etc., etc. - the incoming dementia has obviously obliterated that memory already. So the EU won't suffer, its rural red states that will take the hit from this craziness. Not that he gives a damn now that he's in office of course Ô∏è He said to their faces he didn't care about them and that he just cared about their vote, but the turkeys went ahead and voted for Thanksgiving all the same.... we reap what we sow Ô∏è

Just so people know, a tariff is a sales tax on consumers. A tariff raises the price of a good exactly the same as a sales tax does.

Tariffs raise prices to consumers. That is Trump's way of punishing USA voters for not electing him in 2020.

As a European, I would like to apologize to American consumers for the terrible treatment. I am heartbroken after hearing what Trump said in the video. I am sooo sorry that we provided you with good and cheap goods. I'm glad Trump is putting an end to this and will make our products much more expensive for American consumers in the future. At best, Americans will finally be ‚Äúfree‚Äù to only be able to afford American products and nothing else. For example, we all know that no American ever wanted their European car, they were just forced into it by us and the lack of tariffs.

The U.S. can hurt Europe with tariffs, but Europe has enough leverage to hit back just as hard if not harder. The EU can diversify suppliers more easily than the U.S. can replace European markets, and European countries tend to stay united in trade disputes, while U.S. industries often pressure their own government to back down when they start feeling the pain

The benefits of tariffs are: #1 minimizing dependency on foreign counties, #2 discouraging insatiable consumption habit, #3 increasing federal revenue, #4 bringing jobs back to America, #5 lowering our national deficits, and #6 (ultimately) Making America Great Again!

The people are the one paying the tariffs, that's true, but it's 
The tariff increases government revenue, government revenue can be used to support Americans who are underprivileged
The tariffs will make ""Made in USA"" products more competitive on the market, allowing these business to grow, which provides more job opportunities for local Americans.

Tariffs only sometimes passed on the consumer? Always! Even if an importer could "" finance"" the price increase by absorbing tariffs (which means they are reselling at a huge mark-up) , this would only be temporarily and impoverish the importing company. Europe sells a lot to the US and consumers would quickly find that in their pockets unless they start buying American made substitutes. Well good luck with finding the equivalent of European made products in the US!

As a Canadian I'm not a fan of the tariffs, but the US has so much debt that needs to be paid. Trump is only trying to do everything he can to create a surplus rather than a deficit. That's income through tariffs and cutting costs. And if countries want to negotiate no tariffs he now has an advantage in the negotiation by simply removing the tariff. It's not personal, it's just business.

The EU does not produce or export products but large EU head-quartered yet multinational corporations do. And most multinationals have manufacturing operations in the US already. So import tariffs target mostly smaller and mid sized exporters of specialty products. Will be interesting to see whether or not and to what extent US importers of foreign products will pass on tariff costs to customers.

Wall Street consistently makes misguided decisions. Their excitement over the passage of trade agreements NAFTA and GATT, which resulted in the loss of American factory jobs to Mexico and China, reveals their shortsightedness. As for me, I couldn't care less about the opinions of the investor class. Before these disastrous trade agreements were enacted, American workers were in a much stronger position. I advocate for their complete abolishment. While the current tariffs are a step in the right direction, I believe they should be raised to 100%. This would compel manufacturers to relocate their factories to the United States, ensuring an abundance of well-paying factory jobs and a more reliable supply chain. It is crucial for America to achieve complete self-sufficiency in all essential areas, including energy, textiles, advanced electronics, and heavy industry

While I‚Äôm not 100% against tariffs, it will just further the class divide. Assuming tariffs replaced income tax, which would be great for me personally, the nearly half of Americans that do not currently pay any income tax would be devastated. So, people with money come out ahead while the lower income class, many of whom support Trump, get beat down further. Perhaps tariffs on certain goods coupled with a flat tax, where everyone pays their share, would be better?

Given that Europe has some of the highest employee costs in the world, I wonder why Americans are buying European consumer goods. Putting tariffs on these imports will let American manufacturers of the hook, but it won't make them more efficient. Meanwhile, Europe may well seek out other markets. It's a case of a short-term ego trip for Trump versus long-term damage to America's status in the world.

I'm starting think he really doesn't know who pays the tariff.

Trying to produce simple products like clothing would see the price of clothing sky rocket. Many foods, fuel, lumber, and so on. I wonder if American's believe they lie that other nations are paying the tariff?

I am interested to see how it turns out. Americans can grow and make everything they need themselves, and they do it well. Hopefully they put the engineers back in charge of factories and get rid of the bean counters. I reckon my own country Australia should promote the welfare of the people in it by incentivising production within Australia. I don't know crap about economics, but I would sure as hell buy a Dodge made by Americans again rather than in Mexico, and American stuff over Chinese. If Australian governments encouraged domestic production, there would be a chance for young people to learn skills and innovate, and progress as well as self-sufficiency would be achieved. It is the ones who get rich buying and selling, the middle men, who don't like nationalism. People with ability stand to prosper, and social cohesion develops through cooperation.

I am so sick to hear we all treat the americans soooo pooooorly, then buy less from us and just shut up. I for one, for example don't want your food, i prefer to eat food without toxic ingredients. He's so often talking about food we don't buy, well make better food and i will buy it. Cars, they don't buy our cars, for one that's not true and i prefer smaller cars not this big trucks you make. And i don't get it, these Tarifs are paid by his own people. Just crazy...

Just what are these vital European products that average people would be screwed without? It's not like the average joe is going to be hit by extra import tax on his crate of 20 year old vintage french wine. Everything else, such as cars can be made in USA, resulting in more manufacturing jobs in the USA, and potentially more EXPORTS to other countries.

""USA terribly treated by EU"" I would qualify that statement a little!

The economic relationship between the United States and the European Union is one of the most significant globally, encompassing trade in goods and services, as well as substantial investment flows.

Trade in Goods and Services:
Goods: In 2022, the U.S. exported goods worth approximately $351 billion to the EU, with leading markets including the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium. 

Services: The same year, U.S. services exports to the EU totaled around $241 billion, resulting in a services trade surplus of $71 billion. Key sectors included intellectual property, professional and management services, and financial services. 

Investment Income:
Beyond direct trade, U.S. companies earn significant income through their affiliates operating in Europe. In 2022, U.S. company affiliates in Europe earned an estimated $325 billion, marking a record high. 

In summary, the United States derives substantial economic benefits from its commercial interactions with the European Union, encompassing trade in goods and services, as well as income from investments.

No Trump fan (in general) here. But tariffs in general are meant to make un-tariffed goods more attractable. Also making the affected country's lower the price to compete. And also forcing competing country's to lower or stop tariffs from our country to make our goods more competitive in that country.

Turning other countries against America. Like all of those countries that are going into BRICS. We don't want to lose our allies as we may need them in the future. So slow down and concentrate on helping Americans get back to normal. That is before Biden etc. tried to destroy us. God bless.

When my father graduated from highschool, anyone could immediately get a job at any number of steel mills or other factory jobs and afford to start their own family. Those factories and steel mills are almost completely gone today to China or other countries and most people aren't starting their families until much later in life or not at all. 

How did it benefit us for all our jobs to get sent overseas? Why would politicians let American companies move their business overseas with no consequences? What did they think would happen? 

Tarrifs provide incentive for companies everywhere around the world to set up production facilities in America to sell to Americans and create American jobs. It's not a tax on foreign companies, it's a tax on foreign made goods. It seems like responsible policy for any country to encourage investment within its own borders.

‚ÄúReciprocal free trade‚Äù is the phrase to learn my non-US friends. And until we get that from YOUR country we will engage in tariff games. And the more reciprocal the free trade is‚Ä¶the lower the tariffs will be.

Nokia used to dominate the cellular market. They lost control to China thanks to non-reciprocal trade. The U.S. ain‚Äôt the bad guy here‚Ä¶and in many cases there is no ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù, just countries (primarily the U.S.) tolerating non-reciprocal trade agreements because of domestic political concerns (e.g., industry payoffs). Now there‚Äôs a new boss in town who ain‚Äôt going for those ‚Äòdomestic political concerns any more.

By strategically applying tariffs alongside policies that drive domestic industry efficiency and investment, America will achieve economic growth while eliminating cost burdens on consumers. Tariffs will protect domestic manufacturers, enabling them to scale production, innovate, and reduce costs through economies of scale. As industries expand, job creation will strengthen the labor market, increase wages, and boost consumer spending, reinforcing economic prosperity. Foreign exporters will lower prices or absorb tariff costs to maintain market share, preventing price hikes. Reduced reliance on imports will secure national self-sufficiency, shielding America from global supply disruptions and trade imbalances. A stronger U.S. dollar or foreign currency devaluation will offset tariff costs, ensuring affordability. Strategic tax breaks and investment incentives will further enhance efficiency and drive long-term growth. With these measures in place, tariffs will fortify America‚Äôs economy, creating jobs, fostering industrial expansion, and securing a stable and prosperous future without increasing consumer costs.

The media is really going to have a meltdown when these tariffs work just like Trump says. So many people saying the tariffs will raise prices on consumers but consumers can buy from other suppliers and tariffed countries will be forced to discount their products if they depend heavily on US markets for sales, which many do. The reporter who said ""In most instances"" should never be allowed around the president again because they are smearing his policy while being incorrect. Just like 60 Minutes did with their Kamala interview.

Also, tariffs on import is beneficial for development of local businesses, who may find it easier to develop. USA is not a third world country, its businesses won't find it difficult to develop high quality services when the necessary conditions will be there.

USA has lots of millionaires and billionaires, they will be the saviors of all US residents, by creating entrepreneurships, investing in US industries, WHICH ESPECIALLY WILL BE EASIER WITH TAX CUTS. And this way USA businesses won't find it difficult to develop high quality services in the beneficial conditions of lower competition because of tariffs on import, and because of lower taxes

This is basic game theory logic. There's (1,1) everyone is doing well, (1,0) and (0,1) someone is doing well and the other is not, and then (-1,-1) where both people are doing poorly. Right now, the US/EU relationship is (0,1) in that the EU depends on our giant expenditures to fight their wars and defend them for instance as they fail to live up to their agreements. The tariffs when applied then drive the situation to (-1,-1) both sides are unhappy, are raising tariffs, etc and then once sufficient pain has been felt to reset the situation, it can go back to a (1,1) scenario as relations are once more normalized. The other option is then a (1,0) situation where America looks elsewhere or maybe the bear of Russia gobbles up some more European countries until the EU either returns, or they suffer more and capitulate first and then are the losers for awhile. However, there is no rational incentive for the US to stay in the (0,1) situation with the EU.

16,"After the tariffs on EU products, Americans can choose between the (apparently) more expensive American products and the, thanks to the tariffs, then more expensive EU products. Are they really that stupid in the US?"
17,"Please, Trump - do it! Perhaps you‚Äôll learn how tarrifs actually work. The Americans will hate you for it, and we (Denmark) are their friends. Mr. Trump, you are not."
18,As a foreigner sometimes I just get amazed by the intellectual capability of the people from the so called greatest nation on the planet (not everyone)
19,I hope Americans are prepared for record high inflation because that's what's coming.
20,This is your reminder that 0% of smartphones are made in USA. Imagine if those suddenly went up to $5K....
21,Wow. He is pushing US to the corner without any friends left. Bravo!!
22,Understand this. US citizens will pay the tariffs. China and all the other countries will not pay one cent. The importer will pay the original tariff then pass the cost on to the public. That is how it works.
23,This guy is so dumb
24,The EU is a 18 trillion dollar economy. Americans will feal some serious pain
25,All of you cheering for this are going to be in for a rude awakening.
26,"Well, I have bad news for Trump: I and millions of other Europeans will be actively boycotting American products if and when he applies tariffs to the EU, which will invariably hurt US consumers far more than us. Why? Because US consumers appear to have a marked preference for European quality consumer products, namely German-made cars, as opposed to those made in the land of Uncle Sam, which nobody really wants to buy on this side of the pond, with the exception of Tesla, at least for the time being. I would also draw his attention to the dire consequences witnessed after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930) was implemented. Think again, Mr. Trump."
27,"Sad but true, US citizens shall pay for their own votes, which are really quite expensive"
28,"Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome. You tried this stunt 4 years ago Donnie, and the EU targeted retaliatory tarriffs that would effect your red state base the most. Tennessee whiskey, Harley Davidsons, etc., etc., etc. - the incoming dementia has obviously obliterated that memory already. So the EU won't suffer, its rural red states that will take the hit from this craziness. Not that he gives a damn now that he's in office of course Ô∏è He said to their faces he didn't care about them and that he just cared about their vote, but the turkeys went ahead and voted for Thanksgiving all the same.... we reap what we sow Ô∏è"
29,"Just so people know, a tariff is a sales tax on consumers. A tariff raises the price of a good exactly the same as a sales tax does.

Tariffs raise prices to consumers. That is Trump's way of punishing USA voters for not electing him in 2020."
30,"Weird place to cut it. 
Tarrifs are like losing your biggest client and then your competition can step in and steal them. In that case, the consumer will pay $0 difference."
31,When Biden was president and u were paying higher prices were the journalist so concerned about prices?
32,Who the hell cares about American tariffs other than Americans when they see their already high shop prices going through the roof ?
33,"""in most instances"" is incorrect. Americans can buy from other countries without tariffs, and should. It's the whole point"
34,"so ? As a European we dont give a fuck the ford gets more expensive not that bad, lets se how the US like tarrifs on their products :)"
35,In what way has the European union treated you so terrible Donald? Not buying your cars and landing fees for aircraft? Don't forget the E.U has 400 million people they will bite back.
36,"American taxpayers end up paying for these tariffs, you know this right?"
37,Trump Threatens Tarriffs On European Union ... But American Tax Payers Will Pay The Price For Those Tarriffs Pahaaa!!
38,"My left ear loved this and all your videos, thanks Forbes!"
39,Europe first
40,Lets start making everything inhouse. Then the Tariffs only bother foreign countries.
41,Kick ass Boss
42,"As a European, I would like to apologize to American consumers for the terrible treatment. I am heartbroken after hearing what Trump said in the video. I am sooo sorry that we provided you with good and cheap goods. I'm glad Trump is putting an end to this and will make our products much more expensive for American consumers in the future. At best, Americans will finally be ‚Äúfree‚Äù to only be able to afford American products and nothing else. For example, we all know that no American ever wanted their European car, they were just forced into it by us and the lack of tariffs."
43,He is crazy. Absolutely demented.
44,"Please do.
I don't mind at all!"
45,EU can just do a blanket tax on US citizens when they come for their holidays in the EU and those who own a home here.
46,"Well, if it's too expensive, don't buy it that's all"
47,They don't buy enough stuff. They need to fix that.
48,A lot of trump supports are so stupid that they don‚Äôt realise how this is going to adversely effect them.
49,Thank you President Trump it‚Äôs about time Ô∏è
50,"Put 10000% tariff and prohibit them from passing it on to customers, freeze price hikes for 10 years hahaha"
51,This man doesn't know what he is doing
52,"First, they fascinate the fools. Then, they muzzle the intelligent.‚Äù Bertrand Russell"
53,"The U.S. can hurt Europe with tariffs, but Europe has enough leverage to hit back just as hard if not harder. The EU can diversify suppliers more easily than the U.S. can replace European markets, and European countries tend to stay united in trade disputes, while U.S. industries often pressure their own government to back down when they start feeling the pain"
54,This man definitely has the most security of any president
55,"Are these bots or actually really angry people? Anyway, I guess we'll see how it turned out in maybe 4-5 months."
56,"It is the corporate US that has been unfair to the american citizens, not other countries... But you will take their bait and pay the price as usual. You have just given them more power to run you in circles."
57,Do it
58,"What an idiot--in office less than a week, and he's already landed us in a trade war with everybody! Way to go, America."
59,170 m people and this is the best they have got. Lmao
60,"Makes American companies more competitive and it creates an impetus to start bring more jobs home.  It's a short term price hike with President Trump, or a permanent price hike with the Democrats."
61,"You all realize Trump is using tariffs as a bargaining chip for negotiations, right? He‚Äôs a businessman not a politician. He‚Äôs aware of the disadvantages of tariffs but is betting that these nations will bend to the US and give us more favorable terms in trading, expectations on foreign aid, etc"
62,What about big companies that are unfair to americans themselves.
63,it makes you look closer at what you buy and where it comes from . All will have to compete .
64,"It's all going to be okay, just ask us Brits if Brexit has improved our lives and made us grow as a country, hell no."
65,"president trump are you going to tariff iraq,absolutely they've treated us so badly"
66,For those who dont understand........ let me explain. America will win with tariffs. Yes everything from the outside of the USA will be more expensive. BUT this forces Americans to buy local which means they stop buying products from the outside. Wait and see.
67,It's amazing that the can understand that taxing the seller costs the buyer (trickle down economics) when they need to.
68,"Every country in the world should cut off merchandise to the üá∫üá∏ USA,"
69,His pampers will be more expensive jajajajajaja  hilarious
70,wow a president who talks to reporters and doesn't mumble nonsense.
71,"My father was Chinese. One of the Chinese expression I heard him use certainly applies here too: ""whoever deals with people like pawns will end up with an empty chessboard""."
72,"0:18 ""do you want the truthful answer or the political answer?"" Truth! ""ABSOLUTELY"""
73,"""the european union has treated us so terribly"" "
74,Do it please do it trump won
75,"Fired the head of the Transportation Security Administration, 2. Fired the entire Aviation Security Advisory Committee, 3. Froze hiring of all Air Traffic Controllers, 4. Fired 100 top FAA security officers."
76,"It's about where the money ends up. If Americans buy from other countries the money leaves America and stays in the other country. If Americans are forced to buy American made, American money remains in America where it can go towards other American things."
77,I'm swooning with admiration!
78,We don‚Äôt care.
79,I agree with him the fairness part but the strategy and rapid pace of imposing so many tariffs at once seems not very well thought out
80,"He's actually doing us in the EU a solid, he will unite the EU finally.. this will force the EU to come together now to hit back at the US."
81,"T$, I‚Äôm not tired of winning."
82,"Tariffs are a regressive tax. The further down the wealth scale you are, the harder they hit.  Wealthy people will be fine, because necessities constitute a minuscule part of their total expenditures."
83,Tarrifs >price controls.
84,When a bully tries to bully everyone that‚Äôs when everyone gangs up on him.
85,"I have 100% in our president, if I didn‚Äôt I would not have voted for him. ALL of us need to keep him and our country in prayer. He‚Äôs making moves and there is A LOT of opposition coming from all ends he and our country really need to be vigilant and prayerful."
86,Trump: lets impose tarrifs on all allies!
87,BUY FROM USA. ISSUE SOLVED! 
88,"""SOMETIMES""!"
89,"I love this man, our President Trump.  This is not a piece of cake!  He knows and i honor that!"
90,Somebody here has no idea about how tariffs work or history.
91,Her trying to explain how business works to the business man 
92,Tarrifs guy
93,Two car manufacturers in Canada are already moving back to the US because of the Canadian tariffs.  Yea.
94,Donnie Darko will destroy everything. People do not even begin to understand how foolish they were to put this man in the office.
95,"My poor American friends, the world just can't trust the USA anymore"
96,"Yes, the consumers pay, but local manufacturers get the benefit. By local ffs."
97,"Can someone explain how this is beneficial to the American people? When I try to look into it, it only says how the consumer just foots the bill almost all the time?"
98,"Time will tell , time will tell"
99,I‚Äôm from Europe and I like the way he answers questions. Non of that 5 minute political correct circle answer.
100,Trumps a lier
101,All this does is raise prices for consumers that pay the tariffs through higher prices. The country that‚Äôs being tariffed isn‚Äôt harmed at all
102,"With the tarrifs in place well all be learning a few new words, deflation and scarcity"
103,"This man is not only a threat to our country, democracy, but to the very values the country was built on."
104,Why do they cut videos short to remove context and discussion 
105,the Google bots are here lol
106,"Hmm so if I understood correctly, this means US consumers would pay higher prices on goods from EU and other tariffed countries. Which in the end the outcome would be less sold products for companies from that countries which means less money earning."
107,"Does this mean we have to pay more for all the Trump merchandise that's made in China? And just why is all his merchandise made in China, does anybody know why?"
108,Now I have to pay more for trumps golden sneakers 
109,Damn straight
110,Little tariff man
111,The immense amount of smooth brains in this comment section are hysterical
112,Is he still in there signing EOs? I hope so.
113,I just make everything myself and live frugally. 
114,And you wonder how he managed to drive something like 20 of his business into the ground and file for bankruptcy 6 times..
115,"""Do you want the truthful answer?"" He never has one."
116,"Come one Donald, do it. As an European I'm asking you do it. Impose tariffs on all countries so your fellow countrymen see that they'll be the ones footing the bill.

Because the prices here will stay the same, it's the prices there that going to increase.

Come on Donald. DO IT!"
117,"In a very oversimplified way, if you export more than you import in most areas, it can work, even if it is a short term measure. You tariff the heck out of the all the dependencies."
118,"I would find it hilarious if he doesnt impose any on us in the UK now , all the remoaners would see how good Brexit is then."
119,In what way has Europe been treating US bad? He doesn''t explain that
120,Hip hip hooray! Who doesn‚Äôt like the sound of inflation!
121,Americans did vote their most representative individual out there. That's the point.
122,Isn't it amazing the only thing the media and journalists are concerned with is keeping the country divided instead of working with people trying to bring the country together it's just astonishing
123,when the hell is he going to talk about UFOs?
124,Use the tariffs to create a system that can track the origins of the goods and products. This will prevent the tax invation from the so called allies.
125,Yes
126,"I like how corporate taxes and raising the minimum wage aren't going to raise prices, but tariffs are."
127,"Truthful answer? Wow, that‚Äôs different."
128,So raise prices for everybody.  Collect the money via tariffs and tax.  Then give to the rich.
129,"Y‚Äôall think Americans care if you buy ford? Youre already tariffing everything American so what‚Äôs the big deal? No less will be sold. The larger issue is, we buy European. We don‚Äôt buy, you don‚Äôt sell, you don‚Äôt make a profit that we can easily survive with. Now support yourselves and we‚Äôll take care of ourselves and we‚Äôll see who‚Äôs profitable at the end of the day. Good luck"
130,Trump üá∫üá∏
131,Typically the tariff gets paid by the incoming country at a rate of 80%. We'll have to pick up the other 20% maybe. That might get reduced a bit via competitive prices. But overall a great deal for us.
132,Just how dumb can he get get? Quite seriously!
133,Good job trump  making wef shake in thier boots 
134,Next will be imposing tariffs on Greenland.
135,"He simply do not understand the difference between distributive bargaining, and integrative bargaining in dealings, and this stupidity will cost the US people a lot, he is simply too stupid to understand basic learning in diplomacy."
136,Put tariffs on American goods
137,It's sad that trump is so stupid.
138,Buy American...made in the U.S.A
139,"The benefits of tariffs are: #1 minimizing dependency on foreign counties, #2 discouraging insatiable consumption habit, #3 increasing federal revenue, #4 bringing jobs back to America, #5 lowering our national deficits, and #6 (ultimately) Making America Great Again!"
140,It would be easier to say which all country isn‚Äôt where there would be no tariffs imposed. Those countries can celebrate for the time being.
141,I love how at the end she basically debunked tariffs to his face and he just goes ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù. Clown as mf
142,"The people are the one paying the tariffs, that's true, but it's 
The tariff increases government revenue, government revenue can be used to support Americans who are underprivileged
The tariffs will make ""Made in USA"" products more competitive on the market, allowing these business to grow, which provides more job opportunities for local Americans."
143,"No problem. It shall be 50% EU tax on all American products. 
We'll lower taxes to 5% on Chinese and get them from there. Tech and Hardware included."
144,"Tariffs only sometimes passed on the consumer? Always! Even if an importer could "" finance"" the price increase by absorbing tariffs (which means they are reselling at a huge mark-up) , this would only be temporarily and impoverish the importing company. Europe sells a lot to the US and consumers would quickly find that in their pockets unless they start buying American made substitutes. Well good luck with finding the equivalent of European made products in the US!"
145,Tarrifs actually contributed greatly to the great depression so i think yall should reflect back to the 1921 tarrif act and the strain it had on our economy until it imploded.
146,Everyone should just make and use their own stuff
147,"Europe does not need USA to live a normal life. Everything USA makes we can make it also. Oil we got it,Coal,Water,Coffee,you name it we can make it,built it grow it. We Wish you a good Night sleep Mr.President Trump."
148,Canada should trade directly with Mexico and avoid the predatory American corporate oligarchs in the US.
149,High time Europe did business with Russia and Iran and China. In the end that may just be what will happen. Europe needs Russian gas and Iranian oil.
150,Put them on the UK üá¨üáß to get Starmer out.
151,"Hooray! Everyone gets inflation!  There's no way this is going to backfire and cost people jobs, homes, and life savings."
152,Thank you Mr Trump
153,"No US cars in Europe is enough to show how unfair trade can be. That said, US cars were crap for so long, it was supply and demand to a point but still unfair trade."
154,this will back fire on him it goes both ways don't fuck with your alias
155, just yes
156,"Why would Europe countries would want to buy GMO food from US, and not so reliable cars either, there is nothing wrong about that."
157,"It‚Äôs like moving into a neighborhood, pooping on everyone‚Äôs lawn, and hoping for the best."
158,Impose tariffs on Britain and force starmer out
159,We elected Donald Trump! Just let him do what we elected him to do without complaining. In good time everything he promised will come to light
160,"I mean, who cares? It's not like EU exports are mainly directed to the US; the threats of tariffs may work on canada or latin america (considerong nearly 50% of their exports go to the US) but we have several trading partners and we can always make more exactly with those very countries americans decide to tariff.
I really don't understand how this guy thinks he may scare other people in doing what he wants"
161,Trump still has no fu.ken clue how tariffs work. 
162,Sometimes? What a giant genius.
163,"even before Trump, i seen that the world was leeching off of us.  And weve made the friends were gonna make, now time to tighten grip on the users"
164,  President Trump is just classic! 
165,Who would end up pay the tariffs that he imposed? 
166,Get'em Trump!!
167,I will never buy a USA product again
168,Thanks  for cleaning up the mess trump 
169,"All these countries, including the EU, should specifically zoom in on maga America and his voters, hard, in a very overt and well reasoned way so they understand why. It‚Äôs basic and rudimentary game theory."
170,He is Pushing EU to join China and Russia what USA build for.ages this guy ruined evrything Lmao
171,Sometimes ?
172,"Trump adds tariff to all the Ukraine supporters' countries, he are trying his best to support Russia."
173,Absolutely! Tariff is a great option. At least 80-90% will help the economy.
174,He really still thinks this is a good thing. What an idiot. It's going to drive up prices for American companies and the American consumer.
175,"This was EPIC!
As an European LEGAL immigrant I can't stop laughing."
176,"It‚Äôs really funny finding almost nothing but salty Europeans in the comments.  Generally speaking, that‚Äôs my sign that this is a good idea. :)"
177,he simply does not have enough expertise and vocabulary for a complex answer.
178,Best US president of all time
179,Oh he can try. American cars are already tariffed in EU and more tariffs will just boost European business
180,He‚Äôs going to get destroyed
181,Its trying to force the companies to return to USA market or produce it locally
182,Trump 
183,I really hope the EU / Canada and perhaps even Mexico can form some sort of deal virtually pushing the USA into a corner
184,Buy American.
185,How about u solve the price of eggs first!
186,The EU has treated the UK terribly also. TARRIFFS TARRIFFS TARRIFFS 
187,It would make a change.
188,Hello Russia & China in the comments lol bot bot bot bot
189,It sure does get cold in that European Union I hear they have a gas problem
190,Sometimes Ô∏è
191,BUT I WANT A BMW!!!!!!
192,"Hell, I'll pay triple!"
193,AWESOME ANSWER!!
194,What a sad creature.  The only thing that makes me happy is knowing how miserable his life must be.
195,"it works like a tax on US citizens, sure, but you have the choice to pay more for foreign goods, or not, & the extra cost is collected by the feds to benefit the US, not foreign entities"
196,This is what we hired him for. He is executing the will of the people.
197,Tariff on japan tariff on Jamaica tariff on the moon tariff on me tariff on the floor
198,Absolutely‚Ä¶ BASED!
199,Trump probably: If it is only passed on to Americans 99% or less of the times. It is sometimes.
200,Welcome to the start of the great American recession 
201,"even as a german i find him so funny -------guys as europeans we just have to bargain with this bloke for example"" if you cut the tariffs I will up my military spending to 4% of the gdp"""
202,"As a Canadian I'm not a fan of the tariffs, but the US has so much debt that needs to be paid. Trump is only trying to do everything he can to create a surplus rather than a deficit. That's income through tariffs and cutting costs. And if countries want to negotiate no tariffs he now has an advantage in the negotiation by simply removing the tariff. It's not personal, it's just business."
203,"If you make energy cheaper everything will be cheaper so the tariff increase wont be much. Also consumers have choice of non tariff brands. And if income tax decreases and more companies manufacture in US, the disposable income will be greater. Its not just a simple equation"
204,Everyone has treated the US terribly according to this clown. Banana Republic.
205,Europoors
206,u get a tariff and u get a tariff. everyone gets a tariff for no reason
207,Trump is destroying US 
208,Do you want a truthful answer. I can't do that. I never tell the truth.
209,"The truthful answer is that you should take responsibility for the second jet crash, in addition to the first crash. Too many crashes during a very short time of your presidency which means you have done something wrong so far. Deal with real problems, not create new ones for your own country"
210,Now what happens when they all put tariffs on America??
211,If Europe does not pay tariffs the America can exit NATO And leave eveyone in Europe vulnerable
212,Go Trump üá´üáÆ
213,How many crashes is Trump gonna cause this week?
214,His tariff to bring companies back to america and stop outsourcing from allien countries
215,I have zero Respect  for a person that is so disrespectful and rude to others in society.
216,This is going to turn out beautifullyHahaha
217,"Wow, TWO plane crashes in ONE week. What a dumpster fire of an administration."
218,This is going to replace the income tax - eventually. We are worse than broke.
219,Quit showing the devil
220,Why not finish letting him explain?
221,You're too funny  . I voted for the right candidate 
222,"If you think prices are out of control now, just wait a few weeks."
223,"Not to forget he was insisting these tariffs and it was on his political agenda while campaigning for 6 months , and he won by a huge margin , so clearly American people stand behind him and his cause"
224,An easy solution for tariff costs: Buy American.
225,Aight bro
226,Expecting a truthful answer from Don the con is like expecting tarrifs to lower the price of eggs.
227,The EU does not produce or export products but large EU head-quartered yet multinational corporations do. And most multinationals have manufacturing operations in the US already. So import tariffs target mostly smaller and mid sized exporters of specialty products. Will be interesting to see whether or not and to what extent US importers of foreign products will pass on tariff costs to customers.
228,Yes trump and trumps cabinet the patriots of the uk üá¨üáß love you so muchÛ†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åøüá¨üáßüá∫üá∏
229,Trump is just leveling the playing field.
230,He similar to putin
231,"That‚Äôs going to drive up prices in America, no? I thought he wanted to bring prices down?"
232,"Does he really think that all these countries will let him get away with this ?‚Ä¶..no,he will soon find out."
233,"Tarrifs in a globalised supply chain. Good luck everyone! Hopefully the US can start making its own tech, electrical goods, manufacturing machinery, clothes...."
234,"Wall Street consistently makes misguided decisions. Their excitement over the passage of trade agreements NAFTA and GATT, which resulted in the loss of American factory jobs to Mexico and China, reveals their shortsightedness. As for me, I couldn't care less about the opinions of the investor class. Before these disastrous trade agreements were enacted, American workers were in a much stronger position. I advocate for their complete abolishment. While the current tariffs are a step in the right direction, I believe they should be raised to 100%. This would compel manufacturers to relocate their factories to the United States, ensuring an abundance of well-paying factory jobs and a more reliable supply chain. It is crucial for America to achieve complete self-sufficiency in all essential areas, including energy, textiles, advanced electronics, and heavy industry"
235,"It's alright, we'll just import from other countries. - Greetings from the EU"
236,Sometimes... 
237,"Good...at least Canada, Mexico and China are not alone."
238,He won't implement tarriffs on the uk
239,"So Trump, boneheaded as he is, Tariffs the world, the response will be interesting to watch."
240,Why not?
241,"While I‚Äôm not 100% against tariffs, it will just further the class divide. Assuming tariffs replaced income tax, which would be great for me personally, the nearly half of Americans that do not currently pay any income tax would be devastated. So, people with money come out ahead while the lower income class, many of whom support Trump, get beat down further. Perhaps tariffs on certain goods coupled with a flat tax, where everyone pays their share, would be better?"
242,If the price goes up on an item I have bought in the past I will look for a cheaper brand. The tariff will make folks look for alternatives. MAGA
243,sometimes????
244,I'm from the UK and think Trump is breath of fresh air. A politician who puts is Country and People 1st.....We've got Starmer who's broken every promise he has made unless you are an illegal immigrant.
245,
246,Only 1 week and he is already pissing the world off
247,"As Hermoine said about Harry Potter, ‚ÄúWhat an idiot‚Äù"
248,"Oh yes, he needs to have the last word ""sometimes"""
249,President Camacho needs to start holding outdoor rallies again in the open fields of Pennsylvania.
250,"The EU should turn round and tell Trump and the USA, well we have decided, we wont send any goods and items to the USA.  This should include all products, food, liquids, electrical, so at some point would say, trump will want to talk this through"
251,Europeans getting zesty in here. Glad they pay attention to our politics and not theirs so they can continue to beg us to protect them from Russia. lol
252,"What would happen if the EU chooses to put tariffs on Google, Apple, Meta, Salesforce, oracle, Microsoft, to name a few. The EU could replace all of those with local companies or develop new ones to replace them"
253,Tariffs can backfire pushing more countries into bricks. In medium term it will help china- russia- india to have more geopolitical influence in the world
254,$Priceless! Stick it to 'em Trump.
255,Go on trump 
256,"Impose? He‚Äôs gonna take a dump on everyone‚Ä¶ and they won‚Äôt question it, they‚Äôll just bring the toilet paper‚Ä¶"
257,Well... let's see about that 
258,"Sometimes!!! ‚Ä¶It always like that. Tariffs are a tax, and the only one to pay is the consumers. EU doesn‚Äôt pay.
Do Donald Trump actually know how tariffs works?"
259,lol he said ‚Äúthey can catch these hands to‚Äù
260,"the dude just brushes off any concern with ""sometimes"""
261,"‚ÄúIf there is an idiot in power, it means those who elected him are well represented.‚Äú - Mahatma Gandhi"
262,Rest of the world should boycott the US and put extreme tariffs on everything
263,"Given that Europe has some of the highest employee costs in the world, I wonder why Americans are buying European consumer goods. Putting tariffs on these imports will let American manufacturers of the hook, but it won't make them more efficient. Meanwhile, Europe may well seek out other markets. It's a case of a short-term ego trip for Trump versus long-term damage to America's status in the world."
264,Crazy Oldman
265,So Trump acknowledges that cost of his tariffs are paid by us Americans.
266,"Cost passed on to the buyer,and ''Sometimes'' passed on to the consumer,what a load of shit! consumer is at the bottom of the food chain"
267,We in Europe should cut ties with america and look elsewhere. So stupid to pick fights like this.
268,"I'm starting think he really doesn't know who pays the tariff. American consumers will see the cost go up, which may mean less consumption of those products from other countries which harms those countries but the US does not have a competitive advantage to try and replace those suppliers with US based ones. Trying to produce simple products like clothing would see the price of clothing sky rocket. Many foods, fuel, lumber, and so on. I wonder if American's believe they lie that other nations are paying the tariff?"

Hopefully they put the engineers back in charge of factories and get rid of the bean counters. I reckon my own country Australia should promote the welfare of the people in it by incentivising production within Australia. I don't know crap about economics, but I would sure as hell buy a Dodge made by Americans again rather than in Mexico, and American stuff over Chinese. If Australian governments encouraged domestic production, there would be a chance for young people to learn skills and innovate, and progress as well as self-sufficiency would be achieved. It is the ones who get rich buying and selling, the middle men, who don't like nationalism. People with ability stand to prosper, and social cohesion develops through cooperation."

326,"The truth would be nice, but your lies tell the truth for those willing to listen"
327,"""USA terribly treated by EU"" I would qualify that statement a little!

The economic relationship between the United States and the European Union is one of the most significant globally, encompassing trade in goods and services, as well as substantial investment flows.

Trade in Goods and Services:
Goods: In 2022, the U.S. exported goods worth approximately $351 billion to the EU, with leading markets including the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium. 

Services: The same year, U.S. services exports to the EU totaled around $241 billion, resulting in a services trade surplus of $71 billion. Key sectors included intellectual property, professional and management services, and financial services. 

Investment Income:
Beyond direct trade, U.S. companies earn significant income through their affiliates operating in Europe. In 2022, U.S. company affiliates in Europe earned an estimated $325 billion, marking a record high. 

In summary, the United States derives substantial economic benefits from its commercial interactions with the European Union, encompassing trade in goods and services, as well as income from investments."
328,No Trump fan (in general) here. But tariffs in general are meant to make un-tariffed goods more attractable. Also making the affected country's lower the price to compete. And also forcing competing country's to lower or stop tariffs from our country to make our goods more competitive in that country.

334,"It's like in chess, if you have more points (pieces) it is beneficial for you to go to exchange pieces. USA's economy is the strongest & most durable in the world. This is why it is beneficial for USA to impose tariffs, even if the counterpart will impose it as well."
335,"Tariffs on EU would mean that 90% of all products imported in the USA will be
more expensive as long as tariffs are in place. It's the opposite Trump promised to do. Trump is just stupid."
336,"""SOMETIMES "" lol so he KNOWS that but says otherwise to his "

354,"In Trumps last term, his tariffs cost American public 73 Billion dollars and thousands of jobs lost due to his agenda.
How many jobs at risk in the last 10 days.
How many lives lost due to his incompetance"
355,"Slow down a little, President Trump. Take things one at a time. After all you still have almost four years to go. Let's get back to helping We the People and making America strong again. Turning other countries against America. Like all of those countries that are going into BRICS. We don't want to lose our allies as we may need them in the future. So slow down and concentrate on helping Americans get back to normal. That is before Biden etc. tried to destroy us. God bless."
356,Sometimes‚Ä¶ 
357,"When my father graduated from highschool, anyone could immediately get a job at any number of steel mills or other factory jobs and afford to start their own family. Those factories and steel mills are almost completely gone today to China or other countries and most people aren't starting their families until much later in life or not at all. 

How did it benefit us for all our jobs to get sent overseas? Why would politicians let American companies move their business overseas with no consequences? What did they think would happen? 

Tarrifs provide incentive for companies everywhere around the world to set up production facilities in America to sell to Americans and create American jobs. It's not a tax on foreign companies, it's a tax on foreign made goods. It seems like responsible policy for any country to encourage investment within its own borders."

366,"‚ÄúReciprocal free trade‚Äù is the phrase to learn my non-US friends. And until we get that from YOUR country we will engage in tariff games. And the more reciprocal the free trade is‚Ä¶the lower the tariffs will be.

Nokia used to dominate the cellular market. They lost control to China thanks to non-reciprocal trade. The U.S. ain‚Äôt the bad guy here‚Ä¶and in many cases there is no ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù, just countries (primarily the U.S.) tolerating non-reciprocal trade agreements because of domestic political concerns (e.g., industry payoffs). Now there‚Äôs a new boss in town who ain‚Äôt going for those ‚Äòdomestic political concerns any more."

393,"Emperor Trump needs to put tariffs on all countries. Australia, Canada, Mexico, India, EU."
394,How is this working for you.
395,"By strategically applying tariffs alongside policies that drive domestic industry efficiency and investment, America will achieve economic growth while eliminating cost burdens on consumers. Tariffs will protect domestic manufacturers, enabling them to scale production, innovate, and reduce costs through economies of scale. As industries expand, job creation will strengthen the labor market, increase wages, and boost consumer spending, reinforcing economic prosperity. Foreign exporters will lower prices or absorb tariff costs to maintain market share, preventing price hikes. Reduced reliance on imports will secure national self-sufficiency, shielding America from global supply disruptions and trade imbalances. A stronger U.S. dollar or foreign currency devaluation will offset tariff costs, ensuring affordability. Strategic tax breaks and investment incentives will further enhance efficiency and drive long-term growth. With these measures in place, tariffs will fortify America‚Äôs economy, creating jobs, fostering industrial expansion, and securing a stable and prosperous future without increasing consumer costs.

410,"The media is really going to have a meltdown when these tariffs work just like Trump says. So many people saying the tariffs will raise prices on consumers but consumers can buy from other suppliers and tariffed countries will be forced to discount their products if they depend heavily on US markets for sales, which many do. The reporter who said ""In most instances"" should never be allowed around the president again because they are smearing his policy while being incorrect. Just like 60 Minutes did with their Kamala interview."
411,"This is why Washington dislikes Trump.  A straight answer.  Something most politicians hate with a passion.  Like the answer or not, at LEAST it‚Äôs a straight answer to a question.  Democrat or Republican, like him or hate him, you should at least be able to appreciate the significance of that, coming out of Washington."
412,"Also, tariffs on import is beneficial for development of local businesses, who may find it easier to develop. USA is not a third world country, its businesses won't find it difficult to develop high quality services when the necessary conditions will be there.

USA has lots of millionaires and billionaires, they will be the saviors of all US residents, by creating entrepreneurships, investing in US industries, WHICH ESPECIALLY WILL BE EASIER WITH TAX CUTS. And this way USA businesses won't find it difficult to develop high quality services in the beneficial conditions of lower competition because of tariffs on import, and because of lower taxes "
413,"Oh no, lots of angry Euros on here. What will we do? "
414,So when will he keep his promise and leave nato? I mean those pesky little Europeans will never spend 5% on their military.
415,"This is basic game theory logic. There's (1,1) everyone is doing well, (1,0) and (0,1) someone is doing well and the other is not, and then (-1,-1) where both people are doing poorly. Right now, the US/EU relationship is (0,1) in that the EU depends on our giant expenditures to fight their wars and defend them for instance as they fail to live up to their agreements. The tariffs when applied then drive the situation to (-1,-1) both sides are unhappy, are raising tariffs, etc and then once sufficient pain has been felt to reset the situation, it can go back to a (1,1) scenario as relations are once more normalized. The other option is then a (1,0) situation where America looks elsewhere or maybe the bear of Russia gobbles up some more European countries until the EU either returns, or they suffer more and capitulate first and then are the losers for awhile. However, there is no rational incentive for the US to stay in the (0,1) situation with the EU."

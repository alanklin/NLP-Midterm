Lost manufacturing jobs in the U.S. are not due to the conduct of other countries. It is because the American companies decided to look for cheap labore in other countries. So, it was the greed of the American companies that created the problem. Thus, blaming other countries for the greed of the American companies is simply absurd and counterproductive.

Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..

Highly paid CEOs will have to figure out how to make a profit? Yes, by cutting jobs. Labor is the biggest source of spending for a company. And these highly paid CEOs need to answer to shareholders and Wall Street. Higher prices mean less people will buy goods and services, leading to lower GDP, and thus leading to more unemployment. Lighthizer seems light-minded about this reality.

Lighthizer said that if it doesn't work in 10 years we can go back to the other way.
That does not seem very reassuring to me. Hang on to your money as there could be an economic downturn.

Canada, the EU and China have high tariffs on our things and they're kicking our butts in trade, so shouldn't we put tariffs on them and open up a can of a*swhoop? Why are tariffs only bad for the US, but okay for everyone else? Canada has a 276% tariff on US drywall, 238% tariff on US poultry, 270% milk, 265% sugar, 295% peanut butter, 245% cheese, 298% butter, 93% wheat, 160% barley, 163% eggs, 100% fish, 100% tobacco, etc etc. They wanna sell here tariff free and get all butthurt about a 25% tariff when they have triple digit tariffs on our things.

China has high tariffs on US products, preventing us from selling there, and they are prospering, so the logical thing is to put high tariffs on all their things. It's not rocket science or brain surgery.

""Tariffs are a tax on a foreign country""

What this person fails to understand is that the capitalist system transcends individual intentions. Companies will inevitably pass the additional costs onto consumers, leading to higher prices. This can trigger inflation, which may result in reduced investment as interest rates rise in response. Overall, this is one of the least efficient ways to negotiate, as it disrupts the domestic economy of your country.

And he doesn't think companies will lay off people? They already are. Heard from several Channels in Tennessee and other nearby states. 
People YOUNG AND OLD, are living in their cars, and renting rooms in stranger's homes!
Meanwhile, these people, along with everyone else, are watching an army of strangers tell us we are spending too much of the government's money, when we ARE the damn government! 
People are being yanked off of Medicaid and Medicare and Snap and Wic and Meals on Wheels??? CHILDREN DON'T GET BREAKFAST and LUNCH AT SCHOOLS anymore! Seniors don't get their ONE HOT MEAL OF THE DAY thru SNAP? Newborns don't get FORMULA thru WIC? THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO EXPRESSLY HELP THOSE IN NEED!
Trump said he was stopping ALL FOREIGN AID TO ANYONE, in order to make AMERICANS FIRST.
Yet he's pulling the carpet out from people who often have to choose between MEDICATIONS or FOOD, because they don't have enough money for both!
And Medicare isn't free, btw! it's hundreds of dollars a month simply in basic charges and fees, and it doesn't cover everything!!! A senior or disabled person, will either pay an average of $500 a month OR they will be subsidized because they are lower income. Subsidized with programs thru Medicaid!

In order to bring back manufacturing jobs, US needs to develop infrastructure. There is no high speed railway while China has a lot. China also develops a lot of canals to link areas to facilitate transportation of raw materials and China develops clean energy like solar panels.

What's fascinating to me is that conservatives have opposed minimum wage (let alone increases in minimum wage) since the beginning of time, saying that there is simply no way around that causing an increase in the consumer goods we all pay for... its inflationary. 

But these same conservatives in their never-ending quest to agree with everything their dear leader propsoses, will somehow tell you that companies taking on cost of tarriffs will magically ""not necessarily"" increase the cost of goods for the consumer.

Tariffs have some similarities to sanctions in some ways, because it impacts on the society at large (cost of living, job losses, cut on government budget such as health, education, crime, defense etc).   For over two decades my country Eritrea has been under crippling US & EU sanctions because they hated the government and they wanted to achieve regime change agenda.  But the sanctions only hurt poor citizens of the country denying them basic services and as a result causing some take the extreme measures to migrate to other countries.   
The west specially the US often applied sanctions to several countries using all sorts of reason to justify the sanctions.  Countries like Cuba, Zimbabwe, Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, and many more have suffered from evil US and EU sanctions.  If unless Western powers change their foreign policy to non-interventionist policy then there will always be migrants from countries that they sanctioned, coming to their shores.   The irony is majority of Americas and Europeans don’t understand the link between migration and Western interventionist foreign policy.

Tariffs serve many purposes. Obviously some are positives, and some are negatives. It depends also on which side of the fence you are sitting at. 

Tariffs do buy time for the weaker, noncompetitive industries to catch up, providing some breathing space. But it should never be used as a ""fix-all"" snake oil. In fact, I would regard tariffs as ""band-aid"". It provides temporary relief, it shields the wound from sight, but it won't cure the wound. It covers up the wound to keep away the unwanted elements such as bacteria and dust, but that is all. 

The US industries are overly dependent on tariffs for their survival. Politicians who come and go at a regular 4 year interval, are dying for votes to get in the White House. So buying votes is not beyond them, and tariffs is just the perfect tool to do that. What the politicians are doing is to kick the can of ""very things to do"" further down the track, for the successive administration. Biden got the can from Trump, and now Trump is holding that can, and is doing the same. Not only is Trump creating more tariffs, he is also making enemies out of allies namely Canada and Mexico. As for Chyaannah...Trump is soft peddling because he knows it does have leverage over the US, I am talking about critical minerals.

Americans can keep their factories if they are willing to take a pay cut to compete with the international labor force. This is why manufacturing in the US is more focused on automation in the long term anyways.

China's dominance of trade is largely due to the greed of US CEOs and shareholders squeezing maximum profit by moving manufacturing off-shore and basically giving US technology to the Chinese – who aren't stupid and take full advantage of the situation. It's not clear at all that tariff's can address the problem we have created for ourselves. We need to have incentives, regulations and above all, the educational system needed to train people for the jobs we're trying to bring back to the US. Unfortunately, regulations and investment in education seem to be very low-priority for the party in power, and tariff-mania looks to be very short-sighted and most likely ineffectual.

I think we are in a temporary “snap back” period from far too many years of low interest rates, easy to get loans and the United States leading the world in devaluation of Labor. We have far too many burger joints and far too few manufacturing jobs that supply goods to the rest of the world. We will find out soon enough that Chinese and other nations can make a damn good product! Our choice is clear. Do we charge more for access to the American consumer (tariffs) and put down the burger spatula. Do we show up to work on time, sober, and off the govt. dole? Or do we increase transfer payments to favored groups and perpetuate the insanity of exporting our inflation to the rest of the world by trading “little green pieces of paper” for hard durable goods that float here from elsewhere?
This is of course my opinion and is in no way intended to support or critique any individual person or political figure.

Meaning the wealthy in America have benefited  from trade with China. Unlike in China where the poor working class benefited from trade with the U.S. If anything it's the top 1% fault why America lost so many jobs to China, they just took it when we gave it to them.

When they said “Trumps first tariffs on imported steel as intended, steel prices rose. US mills were protected, but the higher prices hurt steel buyers like car makers, economist estimate that the Tariffs created 1000 jobs in steel but cost 75,000 jobs among us companies overall” 

This is extremely misleading. Let’s break it down when you implement a tariff you are completely changing the supply chain.  So what happens? The people working in imports lose there job and have to change their direction. The wholesaler has to change and cuts out another middle man, the port in which it was being shipped through changes and on and on. So people lost there job yes but there is a shift in where the jobs are actually coming from. The other part “prices rose” well when you have 30% of all steel imported and are undermining the us manufacturers workers and wages and then add a tariff that creates a shortage or increases cost because it then takes time for hose company’s to bring their manufacturing back to the US and once in the US they then can compete on a level playing field in which would bring prices back down through competition. However we know prices won’t go down cause everything will only go up but it will grow the economy faster. 

And finally the big one. “Buyers like car makers and the loss of 75,000 jobs overall” well I hate to burst the bubble on this but when he implemented those tariffs it was March 2018 and showed signs of slow but steady growth and then a little thing call Covid happened and assembly lines stopped. 

To get this monkey off the American back we have to cut the cord to china and other countries that drag us down. The manufacturing jobs didn’t disappear over night in this country. US politicians let it happen over the past 40+years to pad their own pockets.

Trump is trying to get our country out from under the thumb of corrupt US politicians and government and out from under the control of horrible trade deals and make our economy rocket back by reducing spending (thank God for Elon Musk) and actually have a balanced budget and possibly a surplus so we can fund things like Medicaid and actually properly fund Social Security. To do all of this it takes significant out of the box thinking and strategy and you have to move fast because if you don’t people like these democrats that are watching their gravy train of USAID get gutted will be nothing but obstructionist and you only have 4 years. I haven’t seen politicians protest something like they are for USAID which is crazy because that money doesn’t go to the people they actually represent!

You guys suspiciously glossed over some more important points about these tariffs. 
The most important point is that the large companies have been doing what is called front loading. They are stocking up warehouses so that they can afford to add a buffer by stocking up local warehouses, and meanwhile their smaller competitors that also rely on imports are going to thrown out of business and eliminated as competition.
All in all, your budget Walmart and Amazon is going to be able to price them out further.
Small and medium business is and has been under threat. That's never good.

It's really sad how people think that Tariffs are just taxing other countries. It is obvious that the companies are going to pass the high tariffs placed on them to the consumers! How can politicians think this is good for our country. It will cause the middle class to be totally wiped out. It will be like 2 classes. The very rich and the very poor.

I live near enough to the Canadian border in Washington state to listen to their radio stations. I have been hearing call in shows daily on the topic of US tariffs. There are Canadian businesses protesting tariffs by refusing to work with the US now. The communities here, such as Bellingham, will see far less money spent from across the border. They are pulling out of existing relationships with the US right and left. Cancelling trips, anything that brings money to the US is subject to protest by individuals, businesses and corporations at this time. They are working to provide more of their own goods and looking for better options across the world for things they'll need to import. Canadians are rising to the challenge. Washington businesses and others that rely on Canadian dollars should prepare for upcoming major hits.

The person who purchases a product is the one who pays the tax, regardless where that product was manufactured. So, when Trump puts 25% tariffs on Canada, that 25% gets added to the cost of the product.

Tariff is the way to recover the losses from reducing the taxes on the rich and corporations.
When Trump 1st reduced taxes, the corporations just bought back shares as well as fired many people and move their jobs to Mexico.

Tariffs were a major factor in the Great Depression, but they were not the sole cause. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and retaliatory tariffs from other countries reduced American imports and exports by 67%. This made the Great Depression worse and slowed recovery.

Let me explain to this expert. Why Americans are losing their jobs is because labor is expensive in the US. People of the US wants to be paid high, work life balance and cheap everything.  You can't get best of everything realistically. So due to this, your American businesses migrated manufacturing outta US for cheaper labor. Theres just no way jobs will be back to US when labor is expensive.

His ask that we “try something different” at the end of piece is funny in that based on his work he really has no idea what will happen.

Since I don't have a choice anyway, I'm going to wait and see on this one before condemning it based on my comparatively limited understanding of the subject matter.

When Trump imposes the tariff, the supplier either stops selling to the USA or increases the selling price.  As such, the importers are paying the tariffs if they proceed to import them.  No one would want to make a loss, including both the importers and suppliers. As such, the increase due to tariff is passed on to the consumers.

You can’t beat the cheap labor in other countries. That is why these companies moved overseas in the first place. If the importer pays the tariff and passes it on to consumers this will be a disaster. Trump wants to pay for his massive corporate tax cuts. This is what this is all about.

Firstly the USA govt needs to realise that they have given all the power to the financial services companies through a number of mechanisms, including the giant in the room called “markets”. So I cannot see how manufacturing industries will stop soon enough to chase lower wages/salaries for improved financial performance (both in financial and share performances). Secondly the USA has a declining population that is not supporting their industrialisation strategy, and further does not support demand and supply balances. Lastly, the tariffs strategy may go against WTO principles, which means the beginning of the end for necessary international bodies that were established to ensure balance in the world (in short it renders, WTO, IMF, World Bank, UN and its many bodies, and others irrelevant - something that BRICS and countries of the south have been complaining about anyway). It will be interesting to see how NATO’s economic and industrial status (let alone declining populations) will assist them without a proper engagement with the rest of the world

This guy's clueless. A tariff was put on washing machines Trump's first time around. The goal was to give US manufacturers an opportunity to increase market share. The foreign machines were of course more expensive. Guess what? American companies raised their prices too and didn't increase their market share. Dryers went up too as they're typically sold with washing machines. There were no tariffs on dryers. Same for dishwashers and fridges. No tariffs and they all went up. Here in Canada we import close to $10k more per person than the US. We imported $440B in 2023 from the US, the US imported $480B from Canada. Do the math since the US has 290 million more people. Bottom line exporters and importers will always cut jobs, not profits. Always!

The trade imbalance is driven primarily by the excessive cost of doing business in America, I.e. our high wages, high benefits, high regulations, shorter working hours, vacations, etc.  As long as Americans refuse to work like slaves in a Foxcon iPhone factory, those manufacturing jobs won’t come back to America.  The alternative is. Having $3,000 iPhones, $80,000 basic trucks, etc. which nobody would buy.  Tariffs will not fix any of these issues.

The only thing happening for sure is that some industries and their workers will suffer. One side says they’ll suffer for the greater good and the other says they’re the tip of the iceberg of economic doom.

10:04.  The highly paid CEOs will have to start increasing employees’ salaries. Dramatically. There’s no reason for one person to make 10s -or  100s - of millions of dollars a year. Let that profit flow to the workers. Then they can afford to buy the more expensive American made products,  and then the workers of those companies can hire more workers and pay them decently. A rising tide lifts all boats.

I really want to emphasize that we are way past the nineteenth-century; global trade is not simply importing raw materials to manufacture finished good.
We import raw materials, WIPs (works-in-progress), components, and finished goods and export eaw materials, WIPs, components, and finished goods.
There is a good article from the WSJ that covers a bathtub manufacturer in Utah, whose bathtub is made with ~1,850 parts received from seven countries and fourteen states. Some parts, like the water pump, travel through multiple countries before ending up in the Utahan factory.
We can not simply throw a tariff on a country and expect jobs to come back; we simply disrupt the entire supply chain and may be forced to purchase from another country because we do not have and never have had the production for a certain component.

EDIT: I want to clarify that I am not a free-trade shill and do think that it was a good decision to abolish NAFTA and implement the USMCA, which streamlined all trading, cut obstacles for small goods, and recognized the digital and environmental changes of the 21st century.
These new tariffs throw all that away.

The loss of American manufacturing has led to a significant increase in the income disparity between those with and without college degrees. Carefully structured, targeted tariffs on particular goods could incentivize companies to increase manufacturing capacity in the USA which would create more manufacturing jobs but not as many jobs as people think. Companies would still try to keep costs down by reducing the number of staff hours required to operate factories. AI did not exist 70 years ago during the American manufacturing boom. AI will allow factories to be much more automated than they have ever been. This means they won't actually create that many more jobs for people who don't have college degrees. You'll still need a post-secondary degree or higher to work in an automated factory. Tariffs are inflationary. They are literally designed to discourage the consumption of foreign made goods by making it harder for the companies importing them to compete with American made goods.

For the last few years, even without tariffs, the macro economy if the US has been just fine .  Americans really do not have any idea how good we have in comparison to the rest of the world. We are economic snowflakes.  The issue is not that we don't have enough resources.  The issue as perfectly described by Warren Buffett is how they are distributed. We are blaming poor Chinese workers who simply took jobs for the incessant greedy behavior if our corporations.  Blame the right source and stip beating up on China and other poor countries for the greed of our multinational companies. Understand how to solve the right problem instead of blame fixing.

False. Tarifs would make selling goods more expensive for the Chinese. If it used cost them 1$ by 25% tarifs it’d now be 1.25$. Now an American company that can manufacture the same good for 1.2 will have a domestic edge. The price will eventually jump by 20% however now the American company is producing so the economy of scale will bring down their price to let’s say 1.1$. So finally the price jumps by 10c and now you have a manufacturing base that is producing more which means more money in the workers pocket for example 50c on a dollar. So a 10c increase is offset by Americans having 50c in their pocket. That’s strengthening the dollar not inflating  it.
Tarifs in long term will strengthen the dollar and strengthen the American economy.

Strategic decoupling means we become an isolated fortress. 
That's where we were before WW1. We slipped back into a ""don't mess with me"" posture and sought uneven trade advantages after WW2. By isolating, we can't compete on goods manufactured in the US that other countries won't buy since they get a lower price elsewhere. We then can only sell our goods internally. This dooms both a nation and an empire. BRICS is a good way to show our leaders that our path is wrong. Our leadership is ruining the US. They can't see that the global power structure is changing.

The idea that tariffs will bolster domestic industry and production and lead american consumers to buy domestic goods would be valid if WE ACTUALLY HAD DOMESTIC INDUSTRY, these companies have allready outsourced the vast majority of production and labor to foreign countries so in the end all this is going to do is lead americans to pay more for things they have to buy from foreign producers , because there are no american producers that produce them. domestic products will also go up as companies only care about profits, not empowering the american worker.  corporations got us into this muck by outsorucing everything, and we were complicit in it when we fell in love with cheap foreign goods and continued to consume with no thought or foresight into how this would lead to a long term decimation of the american economy

Free Ports fellow travelers. Dug into that part of tariffs today and was amazed. We have balance of trade blah blah and we have a world system of Free Ports which do not pay tariffs on goods traded all over the world beside ports/airports where imports have imposed tariffs. There are at least 3,500 Free Ports/airports world wide where tariffs don't apply. This causes me much confusion about why the two trade systems exist and do we have free trade/minus tariffs with Canada and Mexico or what? Why is the media not addressing Free Ports and these so called controversial current tariffs at this time? You can go online and find out all about Free Ports, lists of all the ports what they are about etc but nothing in the blah blah zone about why we wouldn't need to impose tariffs on any country. So are we just bleeding hot air in this bloodless war currently heating up our media waves ? Enlighten me please.

As an engineer I'm taking my knowledge and my money and going elsewhere. Going to a country who wants to work with other countries who wants the human race to succeed and cares about their citizens. The ones who are going to be left in this country will not have the skill set to build anything.

TWO big problems here.  1. Trump isn't talking about just targeting China or only applying limited tariffs on a specific sector that needs protected from foreign dumping.  He is talking about universal tariffs on all imports, even from our allies and countries that we have tried to boost economically as part of stopping illegal immigration.  2. It sickens me to hear this man who won't feel a bit of pain in his personal life from the disruption and high prices many of us will struggle with if he gets his way just shrug off the harm this will do to so many by saying we could just switch back in a decade if it doesn't work.

I suggest people read up on the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the early 20th century that led to the Great Depression. If he follows through on his plans, we could be looking at something very similar.

It's not that I completely disagree with the idea of relying less on China to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  But placing tariffs on ALL imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  INSTEAD of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from North, Central, and South America, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a US company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the U.S.  It would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  It would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the U.S. for work.    It would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the Panama Canal, because U.S. and Canadian imports from Mexico, C.A. and S.A. could come by train.  But Trump is the President now, so I guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve OUR (not just HIS) goals.  It would also ensure that those Central and S. American countries stay aligned with us instead of becoming more entwined with China.  Right now, it seems like Trump is pushing countries AWAY from us and TOWARDS closer economic and political ties with China

China's new rare earth policy, implemented through the ""Rare Earth Management Regulation,"" essentially declares all rare earth resources as state property, tightening control over mining, refining, and export of these critical minerals, effectively giving the Chinese government significant power to regulate the global rare earth market, including potential restrictions on export technologies and quantities to protect national security and interests; this policy took effect on October 1, 2024  So , America will make fewer semiconductors because of this, thanks Trump.

Will Trump really grow our Navy this time? Last time Trump said he would greatly increase the size of our Navy. Instead we got just 1 more Navy Ship in the 5 year budget than we had at the end of Obama's term. Admittedly----Congress controls the purse strings----and may not let us grow the Navy. I have no clue----but hope Trump pushes his congress for more ships this time.

What they aren't factoring in is the cost to transport goods from overseas. I thought we cared about the environment? Why are we shipping basic goods from China that can be produced here? We also have a lot of red tape to build factories which should be improved with deregulation. Start up costs have to be improved. Then you have to factor in economies of scale. Prices would improve over time. Wages then increase over time. Once production in the US ramps up, we now how an eco friendly and competitive product, wages are higher, it's American made, quality products return and they could be cheaper in the long run via automation and economies of scale, with lesd transport costs. Depending on the product, this ramp up of production could happen relatively quickly.

The problem the US had with China is that free trade between big businesses no longer works to contain communism.  Communists and their socialized state-owned businesses posing as corporate ones like Jack Ma's have a much better reach with inexpensive good quality products sans the fringe benefits usually accorded to huge corporate businesses owned by the few who earn huge profits.  The windfall does not precipitate to a bigger population but is limited to the industry where the big business operates.  Thus, few benefit from it.  On the other hand, the more frugal state-owned business distributes fairly evenly to the larger populace.  That is why with good quality inexpensive retail consumer goods, which China targets, more people are liking Made in China goods.

Exaggerated and one sided. This is capitalism and free market economy. The American ""entrepreneurs"" and ""businessmen"" used cheap labor in China to make products and bring them home for larger profits, and now you are complaining about this free market economy? You can't have cake and eat it too. You can't expect other countries to be your cheap labor forever. They can learn and do the same thing. 
Now, placing tariffs on products that you no longer make will only cause inflation. Placing tariffs on products that your country makes could be useful if it does not encourage your own manufacturer to bring down quality.

Whether or not China pays for the tariffs - or Wall Mart pays them ( WMT will pass costs onto consumers ) depends on who produces quality goods at the lowest cost. If US can produce at low enough costs to make Chinese products comparatively unattractive, then china will have to eat the tariff in order to sell in US, and visa versa.
But since US labor costs are too hi - China will be able to pass tariff costs onto Wall Mart, and US consumers will end up paying.
So how can Trump keep manufacturing costs down? By keeping labor costs down.  It's the ""Gilded Age"" of McCarthy  come back to life. It will be a race to see who can manufacture with the lowest labor costs and has the highest demand  that will determine who eats the tariff.

How many CEOs care about workers? They care about profits first, then everything else, or they aren’t capitalists. If profits are squeezed, they look for ways to cut costs,,  mostly automate, use lower priced materials, or lower wages. Automation may create some jobs, but most likely which don’t involve the skill set of those laid off.  Unless profits no longer matter, tariffs won’t benefit very many Americans. Those laid off will need to change locations, or carriers, or both.

Why Donald Trump's tariffs are not likely to bring Americans a durable benefit:

Eroding Trust Among Trade Partners: Tariffs create a rift between countries, making it harder to build strong, trusting relationships that are crucial for long-term economic growth.

Fueling Division and Tribalism: Instead of fostering unity, tariffs can deepen divisions, pitting groups against each other and creating a climate of hostility that can hinder cooperation.

Misallocation of Resources: The financial and human resources spent on implementing and managing tariffs could be better invested elsewhere, like innovation and infrastructure, which genuinely drive growth.

Driving Up Prices for Consumers: Tariffs often lead to higher costs for everyday products, making life a little tougher for families trying to make ends meet and pushing inflation in the wrong direction.

Empowering Authoritarian Regimes: By prioritizing tariffs over diplomacy, there's a risk of unintentionally bolstering authoritarian leaders who thrive on nationalistic sentiments, undermining global democratic values.

Promoting Short-Sighted Self-Interest: The focus on immediate gains can overshadow the need for sustainable practices, leaving a legacy of greed that prioritizes profit over people and planet.

Maybe stop looking at economics as a competition and realize that if you reach an equilibrium where China’s labor force no longer is a cheaper alternative then things balance out. Capitalist businesses will always seek to use the cheapest labor. As nations mature their labor force becomes more expensive. It’s the cycle. Eventually manufacturing will find its way to Africa and so on. The key is to keep evolving your workforce to meet different needs.

Wait. What? American CEOs are going to have to figure out how to cover the cost of tariffs? But their whole thing--schlump and his cronies--is that Mexico, Canada and China will bear those costs. So, which is it Bob? Interesting that he was appointed by Reagan. We all know how Reagan's economic policy worked out for the middle class. Oh, it used to be that the average American family used to have at least one full-time employee in their family and even though there was just one main earner, most of those families could afford to pay their mortgages, buy school supplies and groceries, and buy the occasional car and take the occasional family vacation without having to sacrifice any regular stuff like medicine (they had health care back then). It was called the Middle Class. It was a pretty nifty thing for families until Ronald Reagan, yes, the actor, and, probably this buffoon here, Lighthizer, ideated that wealthy corporate owners could be given huge tax breaks to ""invest in their employees and business infrastructure"" and then pass the new financial windfalls they'd get and eventually got, down too the dedicated men and women who had those great, secure jobs that kept them in the Middle Class. They called it ""trickle down economics. It was sold as manna from heaven for the regular worker and family but turned out to be a bunch of wealthy dudes just shaking the p*ss from their d*cks all over us and calling it rain. Oh, it worked out so very well, didn't it?

Tariff's not goint to solve all the problems, not 10-25-50- or even 100% anyway. Maybe 300-500%... things like clothes and building materials, are still cheaper when manufactured outside America even at 100% tariff. Especially when the goods has labor cost is higher than the raw material cost. When an good that is sold at $100, where the labor is at $30, and material at $20, with $50 profit, but if you give it a 100% tax, it's now selling at $200 dollars, allowing you to take (in theory) $100 for every $30 paid to labor (in China or India) and for every $50 the manufacture profits... but still it's NOT going to bring those jobs back to United States, because the labor cost in USA would be at $150 to $300 just to make a $200-product, and the profitabiliy of something sold at $200 minus the labor $150 and material $20, would only be $30 profit, at 15% ($30/$200) profitability, it's not going to attract any business to move its base back into United States... 

Meanwhile, people who used to be able to buy stuff at $100, now would have to buy it at $200, or even at $300 for products made in USA... it would have a short-term pain for the average households, and a long term drop in trade. People who sells stuff at $100 to the United States, would now look for customers outside of United States selling at $100 to make up for the loss of revenue.

In the end, average consumers would either find cheaper tag price items at $50 for much inferior quality, or people could end-up buying from a trip to Mexico or Canada to buy item at 50% discount and bring them in as 'personal comsumption' to evade the import tax. If tariff is at 100%, demand for higher priced item would drop by 50%, and those who couldn't afford, would help jack up the price of much inferior item. Say if you used to buy natural cotton t-shirt at $20 a piece, which gives manufacture $10 for every t-shirt sold. Now it's selling at $40-dollar, and you'll end up buying a $20-dollar chemically-synthesized-fabric at cost of $2 where manufacturer would make $8 for every t-shirt sold, and the US government would take $10-dollar, allowing you to keep your cost down at $20 for t-shirt. the downside for you is that chemically-synthesized t-shirt would contain unhealthy substances and put a strain on US-health system, thereby increasing the insurance cost even further.

I'm not sure where the $10 dollar tax by government would go for every chemically-synthesized t-shirt sold at $20, but it's definitely not in the pockets of average consumers or health insurance of tax payers.

We need to care for nature, our land, our people. Every nation must do this. CEOs too often care for profits alone. They leave their neighbor out on the road in need. Starbucks wint even let you use their bathroom anymore. How is that caring for community? 

Other countries don’t do this. They care about their people, & they make better deals because they demand it. They love their people more. American companies must learn to love their employees & communities more. CEOs aren't being taken advantage of, they are taking advantage & worshiping profits & greed. 

Glad this employer will go back into business & keep the community employed. Every country must look out for its people, not just its CEOs. 

The difference now than a few decades ago is too many CEOs care about raking in money, more than keeping good people employed. It is noble to take less money & have less profits if the money is going into communities. In the past, most CEOs did not care so much about money & profits & more about people & keeping a standard of living.

‌- Expand diversified markets: Actively explore other markets besides the United States, such as Europe and Southeast Asia, to reduce dependence on the US market.
‌- Strengthen international cooperation: Actively participate in the construction and reform of international trade organizations and multilateral trading systems, and promote the liberalization and facilitation of global trade and investment.
‌- Optimize industrial structure: Accelerate the adjustment and transformation and upgrading of industrial structure, and promote high-quality economic development. Reduce dependence on traditional export industries by developing emerging industries such as high-end manufacturing and service industries.

I’m amazed of how stupid Trump is. No longer is the US the only country with resources and best yet, the people are the biggest resource.  The US has genius in the country, but the blue collar workforce is lazy and not able to produce at the same rate as others around the world. The US feels entitled to be the best without the best resource, people. I work for a global company and there is no comparison for plants in MX, Brazil, India and China.  These companies have also built plants, supply chain and other resources where now they can bypass the US very easy, I know because I work for a such company in the automotive industry. These plants are out producing the US by millions and millions of dollars. Whose fault is this?  This is AMERICAN greed? Maybe not? Look at the average American who voted for Trump, these people could not go toe for toe with the rest of the world. So this is why American companies go to the rest of the world and yes it’s a third of the price to produce and sometimes less. I love the US, and I believe we all need each other and when you have dialogue you come up with great ideas and solutions. Not by trying to bully others. The American people will be the ones suffering the consequences.

So you shape things by controlling what you and I buy here. Soon, that would cause us to choose cheapest? And consume far less. Less profit will wake leaders in other economies up. Workers will take a hit but without leverage the economy and prices will not move needles.

If Trump is actually doing actual illegal things, (and I think he is) why are we not therefore hearing about impeachment?  I know it's early, but can we really allow all these shenanigans to continue?  Trump has got to go.

The tariffs are going to hurt small business mostly Republicans which rely on imports more than the large companies who can absorb the costs which will transfer more wealth to them and increase their control over sectors of the economy. It's the gilded age 2.0 being implemented by DOGEs 20225 plan.

what's going on between china and the USA is pure capitalism American companies moved to china seeking higher profits, my question on those moves is doesn't stock price reflect the value of assets? if those companies lose those assets to chines retaliation, what happens to those stock values? how do share holders recover their investments?

If income taxes are less or better yet obsolete but the price of goods is higher will not the addnl tariffs paid on the goods purchased then be paid by both citizens and noncitizens?  By both tax payers and non income tax filers?  
This applies to both US citizens & non citizens.  Some illegal migrants pay  income taxes but some do not. But some US citizens also don’t pay income taxes.

People realize their God is not invincible and will make everyone suffer (except his wealthy friends and family) soon companies will have to let go of many employees to be able to stay in business. Many laborers will be forced into encampments or be deported. Those legally able to work will not work for cheap wages. No jobs, no employees will result in a dominoes effect. By 2028 Republicans will still blame China, Immigrants and the Democrats (with many many billions if not trillions in their pockets) the end. (Hey, but MAGA, right? )

Tarrifs have a back-end benefit that is not mentioned here.  Tarrifs make American made products less expensive, realitive to an import. So, yes, a person might pay more at Walmart for a product.  But the theory is that the person who pays more at Walmart will pay lower taxes because his next-door neighbor now has a job making the thing he buys at Walmart.  His neighbor now has a job that was formerly in China, and he pays taxes, so the rest of us pay lower taxes.

Simple! 🇺🇸 is not competitive, and resources move to areas where they can be used in the most efficient and effective ways to generate wealth. So  🇺🇸 needs to become competitive as its spending power is declining due to other countries having a competitive advantage in certain sectors.  As the rest of the  per capita  income increases  🇺🇸 will become increasingly irrelevant as a leading market for products and so tariffs will not work. The  through globalisation is more integrated than before. No country produces all the raw materials required for its industries. Hence, there must be collaboration. The America first policy is doomed to fail. 🇺🇸 problems can only be solved through creativity, innovation , trade, and collaboration. Capitalism, as well as neo political culturalism, must be reviewed to be relevant for this century. If that is not done, then it will continue to lead to more frustration, disillusionment, conflict, and the coming into power of despots who are incapable of stemming the tide. The  is in transition, and  how we facilitate this transition will determine our survival. We all need to play our part for our prosperity and, ultimately, our survival.

"Lost manufacturing jobs in the U.S. are not due to the conduct of other countries. It is because the American companies decided to look for cheap labore in other countries. So, it was the greed of the American companies that created the problem. Thus, blaming other countries for the greed of the American companies is simply absurd and counterproductive."
"People who are recession-proof saying, ""Well, if this fails, we can always go back,"" make me sick. The average, middle class person who loses their home to foreclosure can't just go back."
Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..
"I'm favoured only God knows how much I praise Him, $230k every 4weeks! | now have a big mansion and can now afford anything and also support God's work and the church."
Could we at least stop pretending that this has anything to do with fentanyl?
This guy really gives it away when he says the very well paid CEOs are gonna just have to figure it out. Yeah. They’re going to figure it out the way they always do. They are not going to cut their own pay and they are going to raise prices.
I’m no economist but I believe this will backfire. We don’t have the leverage we once had and we are pushing our allies away
"""You don't know how much you love going to work until you can't go there anymore."" So true!"
"“If in TEN years it doesn’t work, I guess we’ll go back to what we’ve done in the past” — that’s a wild statement "
"The consequences of high tarrifs are borne by we the consumers, things are gonna be incredibly difficult in the coming days.The increase in prices of everyday items puts them at risk of running out of money. As prices rise, the amount of money retirees can withdraw from their retirement savings also increases."
"Tax cuts for the rich, tax increases for the lower and middle class.  Tariffs will make everything more expensive for consumers too, and prices will go up even higher."
"Translation : 
Nothing new,  The rich get richer , the middle-class & the poor get poorer"
"This is where Trump is getting his advice on the economy. After listening to this guy, I am not impressed."
when Trump is done and the next president removes these bogus tariffs.... we will have a different problem. companies wont wont to drop their prices because they will feel that customers are used to paying more. and they will want to keep profits high. so... yeah. everything will be more expensive from here on out.
Most Americans don't have 10 years to test if the tariffs work.
It's Smoot-Hawley meets Dunning-Krueger
His answer at the end was basically “oh well”.  That’s the problem when you have people who haven’t stepped in a grocery store in years making policies that affect regular folks
"No one talks about how these tariffs destroy the small businesses who aren't big enough to stalk pile on the front end like Walmart and other large, monopolistic corporations. Another power grab."
Why are they blaming other countries and not our politicians?
"I am going back to avoiding US-built cars.
The cars are grossly overpriced due to US labor rates.
Better to buy foreign and get stuck with the tariffs."
"What a clown.  If it doesn't work, we'll go back. What about the lost reputation? What about the hate to USA? Nobody wants a bully partner. Sick man"
European here… suddenly China looks like a better trading partner than the US.
Robert Lightthizer ignores the biggest incentive to move American jobs out of the United States. It began with Ronald Reagan's tax code changes that gave companies incentives to move manufacturing to other countries. Look it up!
I was advised to diversify my portfolio among several assets such as stocks and bonds since this can protect my portfolio for retirement. I'm seeking to invest $250K across markets but don't know where to start.
It’s really an easy formula. If you wanna make our lives better make the billionaires pay their fair share.
"He says it so nonchalantly, if it doesn’t work in 10 years we just go back? Regular people are living paycheck to paycheck. They can barely meet their need expenses and what are they supposed to do in 10 years? Go into debt? I hope Americans are prepared for a real recession, if they think we already in one, they are going to feel it like a depression. When Rich dudes are selling their stocks it means is time to"
The poor and middle class always paying the price & suffering the consequences of these greedy dictators. I’m sick of them.
Only a day later and this video already hasn’t aged well
"It's NOT ""America First"". It's ""Corporate America and stockholders first""."
'The genius of American and our allies can turn this around'. Let's start by putting tariffs on our allies. Madness.
Tariffs = Cost passed onto Consumer = Higher Inflation = Higher Interest Rates
"I'm glad you made this video it reminds me of my transformation from a nobody to good home, $34k monthly and a good daughter full of love.."
Tariffs are similar to raising taxes for everyone. And he is planning to reduce taxes for the riches. Well done.
This guy is more trump than trump himself
"Remember, folks. This guy's boss bankrupted not one, but THREE, Atlantic City casinos, PLUS all the contractors who built them. "
"Thanks for the information. I am 55 already with not enough set aside for retirement, I’ve always been curious about the market and have seen folks who did well in the market retire early, most say they went in small and grew over time, but I do not have that luxury, I have a good capital but I do not know how or what to do to get good outcome, I am open-minded and would appreciate any helpful advice."
We have a president trying to play chess with the skills of someone who can barely play checkers.
"Highly paid CEOs will have to figure out how to make a profit? Yes, by cutting jobs. Labor is the biggest source of spending for a company. And these highly paid CEOs need to answer to shareholders and Wall Street. Higher prices mean less people will buy goods and services, leading to lower GDP, and thus leading to more unemployment. Lighthizer seems light-minded about this reality."
How on earth can 60 Minutes do an entire segment on tariffs without mentioning wage disparity between the U.S. and countries like China and Mexico?
"Idiots. This will destroy the US economy. We live in a global economy, the US is not self sufficient. This will increase prices for everything across the board. Pure idiocy."
So as a 40-year Republican we traditionally strived for zero tariffs.. this is not Republican and is batshit crazy.
"While the poor get poorer, the rich get richer."
"If you increase prices, you contract the economy. People on fixed or low incomes buy less. Asset prices will fall, and the Billionaires will buy everything because they are cash-rich. Disaster capitalism 101"
Tariffs slow down trade. Trade means prosperity. - slowing the economy down artificially means conflict. Go figure.
"In light of what he's saying, why do they let the Chinese buy US real estate and US companies?"
"""America First"" = ""America Alone""    What a dark joke."
"If the US wants to get serious about trade then go talk to Wall St to get them to believe in reduced corporate profits since the US economy is based primarily on consumption, not production."
"With Trump's re-elected, both US stocks and Bitcoin are seeing strong gains. I'm eyeing the potential for more market volatility, but Bitcoin's all-time high is interesting. With inflation and interest rates on the rise, I'm wondering if this is a good time to dive deeper into stocks or focus on crypto for diversification. Any thoughts on balancing both?"
"So he admitted it had nothing to do with fentanyl…it’s all economic. How about we just blame ourselves for decades of not building our manufacturing, etc."
Guy has no training in economics. He's a lawyer...
"So let me get this straight.  You want more entrepeneurship.  But you don't want to provide education, you don't want to provide free heathlcare, you don't want to give time off to start companies like Scandinavia and other countries do, you don't want to provide affordable clean energy with solar and wind. You don't want to provide affordable transportation.  You don't want affordable shipping. You don't even want free K-12.  You don't want social security.  And this is your plan to bring back entrepreneurship in America? LOL!"
"I usually look up your videos for updates! Our government has no idea how people are suffering these days. I feel for people with disabilities not getting the help they deserve. Thank you PAMELA ANN PUNKAR, imagine investing $12,000 and received $305,500 within three  months."
Tariffs are similar to raising taxes on everyone. And he intends to reduce taxes for the wealthy. Well done.
"Good luck, USA. You’re gonna need it."
Looks like the Great Depression will be repeated…
"Tariffs only affect poor people. Rich people don’t notice the increase in costs.
A poor person tax."
Last phrase he said: If it doesn’t work… ooops  These are the advisers? What a joke!
From Australia over here it seems to me we are better off to start trading with the B.R.I.C.S nations. The US has lost the plot.
"A tax on a foreign product, not a foreign country... "
so why 10% on China but 25% on Canada who is the strongest ally (or used to be) to the US.
"what the guy is saying made sense - 40 years ago.  When Reagan allowed corporations to send jobs overseas ( ""offshoring "" )  THAT was the time for tariffs to punish the companies that send jobs overseas and protect our existing manufacturing base.  Tariffs are NOT the solution now."
The economist have already said that it will be a disaster if Trump becomes president. I think he’s going to prove the economist right
The CONSUMER in the US will PAY the “TARIFF” PLAIN and simple!!!
"Who is this guy kidding?  ""CEO's have to figure out a way to make a profit"".  Yeah, by cutting costs and raising prices."
America is a toddler fiddling with a firearm.
How long until this economy collapses? Average family is already stretched thin.
"The US today needs a socialist party to govern that promotes equality in pay among the middle class and the poor. How? by forcing the top 1% super rich to contribute at least half of their wealth for public needs. I know it sounds unfair to the super rich, but for the sake of a whole nation's future, it's worth the sacrifice."
"When you enter Canada you enter through Canada's border and customs officers. When you enter the USA from Canada you enter through the USAs border and customs officers,  so who's letting it in?"
Fetenayl isn't the problem its Trump.
Tariffs are added taxes to us. Not some magic money going into his fantasy export department
"Funny he say ""Allies"" 06:20. When we fire at our closest ""Allies"" by hitting them with 25% tariff. I don't think we are going to find much countries willing to cooperate with US."
they grossly underestimate the greed of CEOs
"“Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,” said the man who declared bankruptcy six times."
My life expectancy is about ten years. There is no going back for me.
What Lighthizer fails to mention is that so many of those products that used to be in the US are made in China now because the American companies ORDERED THEM from Chinese factories. US companies helped to create the very situation we find ourselves in.
"President Reagan's 1988 radio address on free trade, delivered soon after the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement was signed, remains timely: “Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends—weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world—all while cynically waving the American flag.”"
No one needs to wonder what might happen because we have history with Trump‘s first term tariffs.. steel prices increased 30% and now eight years later US steel manufacturing has not increased..
"I live in Europe, people are starting to talk about boycott US products. 
I’m sorry fellow americans, this is not against you, it’s against Trump administration.
I dont know where this path is going to take us, but it’s not good for both sides…"
Bet ya he owns a lot of shares in a company that stands to profit big from the tariffs!
"In Brazil, a Shark vacuum cleaner that costs $148 here costs $2,048 there! This is how Brazilians live—everything is more expensive due to the high tariffs. I never imagined seeing this happen here in the U.S. After decades living here, it is sad to say that Republicans will transform the US in something ugly."
Trump will tell his people what they want to hear. He Always has and they fall for it.
"What you saying china doing the same as US , the difference is China doesn’t make war and killing people but US dose, is it right , so far the most peaceful countries is China, if I am wrong some body tell me"
"13:20 My man's never heard of a false dichotomy.... 

Imagine investing in education and health care. Imagine preparing workers for the workforce. Imagine breaking up big banks, imagine cracking down on monopoly power, imagine all the other ways to spur domestic labor, production, and growth..."
Never  underestimate the power of magical thinking.
GOP used to be free market capitalists and all about small government. Tariffs and market manipulation are exactly the opposite.
2 minutes in and this guy sounds crazy!
This is 100% Trump's achilles heel.  You can't have low prices (his campaign promise) and tariffs.  Pick one or the other.
Tariffs = high prices.
"Trump on campaign - I will lower prices.    
Trump 7 days after taking office - Raises prices."
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
One word collapse.
"""...combined with our allies...."" not gonna have many of those for long..."
"I know this guy is supposed to be the expert, but his ideas sound very antiquated to me. Being the biggest, baddest bully on the block doesn't work when the ""adversary"" has a high intellect and is outsmarting us on several fronts. You can't gut the American people in education, increasing cost of living, healthcare, housing, higher education, giving advantages to corporations and lobbyists that are always at the expense of the people and expect us to remain a leading power when our greatest resource - the people, are struggling. We have no one to blame but ourselves."
"The tarriff plan will evidently lead to high inflation, the high inflation is a significant reason why most retirees have sleepless nights. The increase in prices of everyday items puts them at risk of running out of money. As prices rise, the amount of money retirees can withdraw from their retirement savings also increases."
"As an investment enthusiast, I often wonder how top-level investors are able to become millionaires through investing. I have a significant amount of capital to start with, but I'm unsure about the strategies and direction I should take to help me generate substantial profits like some people are this season."
"I believe her, not him."
"as a truck driver, the road ahead is bumpy, courtesy of low to no freight coming in and going out to China, Canada and Mexico."
It took tariffs to get 60 minutes to understand supply side economics.
why are we starting a trade war with canada?  Trump says cause of drugs at the border?  Lmao what?
"but you imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Also, you fostered the rise of China, as the US sent all its manufacturing to China- to make Billions more and use cheap labour."
"The man gave the answer @10:53, this isn’t about bringing jobs back to America, this about using tariffs to pay for tax cuts."
"President Trump has done ""the tariff"" thing in his first term and has done it very successfully"
Didnt this tariff war crap lead to the great depression? He forgets the lessons of the past...I'm referring to the Smoot-Hawley act of 1930...
No more tequila it’s back to moonshine 
The middle class can not afford to fail for 10 years before someone acts responsibly. Homes and livelihood would have gone.
Very interesting and very informative   
Now why would 60 Minutes give this guy oxygen?
Even domestically made products will go up because they will align their prices with the foreign made goods.
"Lighthizer said that if it doesn't work in 10 years we can go back to the other way.
That does not seem very reassuring to me. Hang on to your money as there could be an economic downturn."
"Canada, the EU and China have high tariffs on our things and they're kicking our butts in trade, so shouldn't we put tariffs on them and open up a can of a*swhoop? Why are tariffs only bad for the US, but okay for everyone else? Canada has a 276% tariff on US drywall, 238% tariff on US poultry, 270% milk, 265% sugar, 295% peanut butter, 245% cheese, 298% butter, 93% wheat, 160% barley, 163% eggs, 100% fish, 100% tobacco, etc etc. They wanna sell here tariff free and get all butthurt about a 25% tariff when they have triple digit tariffs on our things."
"10:36 this fool is not backing his claims with evidence or study, but his “educated guess”. And he is advising Trump. Of course it will be Brandons fault"
Well since they started they’re stupid tariffs everything went up and the market is taking the biggest dip in 60 years
"He’s saying, more jobs and more production in America. But, who will you hire to pick your apples and potatoes when young Americans won’t do it? Who will assemble your techs when you have shortage in well-educated professionals?"
"China has high tariffs on US products, preventing us from selling there, and they are prospering, so the logical thing is to put high tariffs on all their things. It's not rocket science or brain surgery."
"Did the Star Wars Prequels teach us anything?
Oh President Palpatine."
"Lighthizer has forgotten how interdependent the two economies are and who can stomach more pain. Smartphones, PCs and electronic gadgets are made in the PRC. The USA offers some services but manufactures very little. Manufacturing smartphones, IC chips and batteries in the USA is no cakewalk."
This cheif is wrong citizens will pay the taxes.
"USA, USA, USA, now, Canada needs to deal with its fentanyl problem at the border and  across the border, It is a serious issue that requires urgent action…"
"Hey it feels like its more accurate to say ""expect $200.00+ for every trip to the store despite the small list."
"U.S. tariffs are like trying to diet by locking the fridge—sure, you’ll eat less, but now everyone at the grocery store is mad at you."
"American greed is the problem 
That's why China 🇨🇳 is more powerful every day"
I thought the interviewer wasn't supposed to be biased.
This guy doesn't understand the costs of bringing manufacturing back to America
Manufacturing isn't returning to America with those workers.  Automation abd robots will be cheaper than them.
"Wow you gave this guy airtime. Robert Lighthizer has to figure it out! Or get the F out. Study the history, tariff wars are not how you solve the problems that have built up over the years. Such BS. Bully tactic don't work. ""Art of the deal"" or ""art of our demise"""
"When he mentioned the word ""magic,"" I couldn't help but start laughing."
"""Tariffs are a tax on a foreign country""

What this person fails to understand is that the capitalist system transcends individual intentions. Companies will inevitably pass the additional costs onto consumers, leading to higher prices. This can trigger inflation, which may result in reduced investment as interest rates rise in response. Overall, this is one of the least efficient ways to negotiate, as it disrupts the domestic economy of your country."
nothing worse than a lying lawyer trying to sound like an educated economist. good grief.
tariffs are tax on US importer. Not Foreign countries. Lol.
"He says give it ten years and if tariffs don't work, ""go back""...i hate to rain on his parade, but people aren't gonna last 10 months!
Man, you are COMPLETELY out of touch with what the MAJORITY of Americans are dealing with; struggles with higher prices for every single thing! 
And he doesn't think companies will lay off people? They already are. Heard from several Channels in Tennessee and other nearby states. 
People YOUNG AND OLD, are living in their cars, and renting rooms in stranger's homes!
Meanwhile, these people, along with everyone else, are watching an army of strangers tell us we are spending too much of the government's money, when we ARE the damn government! 
People are being yanked off of Medicaid and Medicare and Snap and Wic and Meals on Wheels??? CHILDREN DON'T GET BREAKFAST and LUNCH AT SCHOOLS anymore! Seniors don't get their ONE HOT MEAL OF THE DAY thru SNAP? Newborns don't get FORMULA thru WIC? THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO EXPRESSLY HELP THOSE IN NEED!
Trump said he was stopping ALL FOREIGN AID TO ANYONE, in order to make AMERICANS FIRST.
Yet he's pulling the carpet out from people who often have to choose between MEDICATIONS or FOOD, because they don't have enough money for both!
And Medicare isn't free, btw! it's hundreds of dollars a month simply in basic charges and fees, and it doesn't cover everything!!! A senior or disabled person, will either pay an average of $500 a month OR they will be subsidized because they are lower income. Subsidized with programs thru Medicaid!"
"In order to bring back manufacturing jobs, US needs to develop infrastructure. There is no high speed railway while China has a lot. China also develops a lot of canals to link areas to facilitate transportation of raw materials and China develops clean energy like solar panels. Without infrastructure, manufacturing will be very hard."
"Looking at the US Bureau of Statistics, under the Consumer Price Index, one can notice that in the last quarter of last year, stocks are not really doing well, especially energy stocks as they seem to be below the zero point. However, I don't know if stocks will quickly rebound as I have no clue the direction of the market. Can I get an advice on any other stocks that I can acquire to diversify my reserve of $300k across multiple markets while creating a comprehensive portfolio."
"“He’s a hero because he was captured? I like the ones who weren’t captured.” - Donald Trump, 2015"
Lol I love how he had to pull us aside for a sec to explain to us what tariffs actually are
This guy is a joke. Kuck rock man. He has not been in the grocery stores
The big problem is company greed! The companies doesn’t care about american jobs. Why not make a law that says that you can’t sell stuff in the USA if your company doesn’t manufacture atleast 50% of the components in the US?
Wondering if Trump ever watches 60 Minutes or he just listens to the lobbyists.
"Tariffs don't do any good for U.S. trade or exports, because of retaliatory tariffs. They have been tried 13:20. It's just a disguised way of putting a relatively higher portion vs income of the U.S. debt on the lower classes rather than the upper classes."
Then why are you punishing Canada and your allies? Why are you 25% tariff on Canada and only 10% on China? Who is more of your adversary Canada or China?
"What's fascinating to me is that conservatives have opposed minimum wage (let alone increases in minimum wage) since the beginning of time, saying that there is simply no way around that causing an increase in the consumer goods we all pay for... its inflationary. 

But these same conservatives in their never-ending quest to agree with everything their dear leader propsoses, will somehow tell you that companies taking on cost of tarriffs will magically ""not necessarily"" increase the cost of goods for the consumer. 

WHICH IS IT?"
What makes the US think that other countries need them? Turning point will be when other countries realize that they are able to survive without trading with the US.
"Your thinking is illogical! China grew its economy over the past 30 years to bring the country out of poverty. America, instead stagnated its development and improving of its infrastructure by concentrating on ruling the world. Its citizens suffered as can be seen today.
What happened to Abraham Lincoln's - ""A nation of the people, by the people, for the people...""?
It's now a nation for the super rich! The rest just suffers."
It’s over America. Get used to it. No one is bringing it back.
"Everyone call your representatives, everyday, twice a day. Don’t write or email!"
"Here’s the problem: Tariffs COULD be useful if they are used in certain ways. However, Trump doesn’t know HOW or WHY he really wants to use them. He has stated a host of self-contradictory and mutually nullifying reasons for using them. Trump is not a strategist just an impulsive haggler."
We can turn this current situation around with the help from our allies. Is he referring to the allies we are placing tariffs on and losing good standing with?
So China will figure out how to get around this crazy plan or find other markets.
"if those three people voted for trump, i have ZERO sympathy!

sorry"
Aside from Apple and PCs there isn’t a single American product that I would like to buy. This is just going to cost me money.
200$ a month tax food for everyone. Sneaky way to tax consumers.
I just love when former officials come on liberal media and show why they are no longer employed.
"Lol, I don't ""pay the tariff"" if I don't buy the products. It's time to rethink consumerism."
This kind of nation wide important decisions should not be made by a single person. It should be economists' job to choose the best economical options. The USA have never been a  monarchy and hopefully will never be.
"This guys a fool!!
Import tariffs don't help the average, end-user American consumer when our economy is based on a Capitalistic ideology!  "
"I heard print out $100 only cost $0.02...if $ has not equal with the Gold.  How do you calculate ""Trade Deficit""? 
$0.02 = TON OF GOODS?"
This guy speaks a little like RFK JR
"My main concern is how to survive all of these financial and political crisis, especially in light of the US political power scuffle. The government has really called things more difficult for its citizens, and we can't sit back and bear all the consequences of the bad governance."
What is Congress doing? Tell us how we  can help Im tired of watching all of this. Feeling Helpless and Hopeless
This guy is talking out of his pie hole.
Reaganonics was horrible. Globalization is here to stay. Instead of tariffs just ban certain products that would instead be made here.
What is it with Trump and people with weird voices.
Remember in the 90s when “made in America” and “my choice is America’s choice” was a HUGE thing? The economy was great back then.
"Every bully has his day day, while you were busy searching for a ghost in Iraq the Chinese were busy working"
Well at least we now know where Trump is getting his false information from.
"""Will these highly paid CEOs figure it out"" lets look at that wealth gap. Yup, theyll figure it out by raising prices. This guy is a snake oil salesman"
mega people protesting for trump for a year straight and never actually knew how tariffs work
The last thing we need is more inflation thru tariffs
"With President Trump serving as the 47th president of the United States, there's significant potential for a major market rally, presenting great opportunities for wealth creation. By investing in stocks and digital assets instead of keeping your money in banks, you can capitalize on this surge and build considerable wealth."
I saw the speech from the prime minister of Canada. He has so much grace and poise. What a shame that Trump got another term!!!!
"Should we trust anybody who was with Trump? I don't think so! Hey, you, Lighthizer, tell Trump to print his bible here in America!"
"I buy from China because its prices are cheaper. That's all. That's it. If I can buy a cheaper alternative produced within my country, the heck, I'll grab it."
"In the 1970s and before that, you could leave high school and work in a factory.  Some people worked their whole life in factories. The benefits were great. Eventually,  US corporations didn't want to pay Americans wages and benefits. Many companies left and went to China and Mexico looking for cheap labor."
"This guy is talking a lot of nonsense, the world's economy is interdependent, and the US can't isolate itself from the rest of the world. China is the 2nd largest economy with billions of people and decoupling won't work."
There is no middle class.
"My major concern is how I can protect and preserve my wealth in savings against the various harmful economic forces, regardless of what the high and mighty  economic talking heads discuss at economic seminars. What are the instruments I can buy to help meet my goal?"
"Don’t we already have the best economy in the world.  The last I checked china, germany and others are not doing well.  Wtf?   And why don’t we leave mexico and Canada out and just tariff china."
"If groceries keep going up, I will apply for Gov food assistance.  If I can't get it I try the Food Banks.  If that fails, I guess I will be homeless just to buy food.  Many are already on the edge."
Tax the companies with operations overseas! They need to contribute to the U.S. economy instead of just profiting from it.
The nerve to say that if it doesn't work in 10 years we  ould always go back! ️
Higher prices where the poor shop. The common maga is uneducated.
Start the impeachment process now 
"Remove all ownership of real estate from any foreign investors, unless they live in the USA 6+ months out of the year... We have HOA owners who are not even in the USA 1 month of the year and collect 10's of $millions... If you are not a US perm citizen you do not deserve US $money."
I don't hear anybody talking about the bricks economic community. they're outperforming the G7 by 10 points
We must absolutely strategically decouple from China. We for far too long have done nothing while China rapidly grows and subverts our interest. We however should not bully our allies especially our neighbors who stood with us in battle and peacetime in order to expand our physical foot print. We are on the verge of threatening our most strategic alliances.
"This is just like spectator sport to these people. They get to go back home to their cushy lives while everyone else has to endure the imminent dumpster fire. 

They know tariffs are not intended to be used in this way. No need for speculation, just do a little bit of honest research. This is obviously a smoke screen for something more sinister."
"Feel sorry for Robert Lighhtizer. Hope he goes back to school and take his medication. Trade deficits are caused by fiscal deficits. Increase savings and cut consumption, the demand will evaporate and trade will balance itself."
"Many presidents are trying hard to provide a cheap and affordable products for their citizens.
But Trump is a bit different. He is in another level. Wish you luck americans"
"corporate greed is the thing to blame, raising prices because they no longer have to compete with foreign good is un-patriotic, if they decide to do that. forcing the essential people that make this country run down"
"Tariffs should be on polluters. On the oil cartels who pollute and spread disinformation about climate, renewables and EVs. Tariffs should NOT be on the consumer goods."
this guy is 2 years away from sounding like RFK
An intelligent tariff policy would use tariffs selectively to develop particular markets.  The broadly applied 2025 Trump tariffs won't work.
Our government allowed this to happen.
So we eat less avocados  and more beans  now?? 🫘
The game is over. But the US still thinks it can win.
"Trump's policies had been viewed by many experts as more positive for the financials sector, spurring this massive rally. It's enticing to consider purchasing some stocks, I'm contemplating investing more than $300k. Thoughts?"
"Financial education is crucial today to show incredible resilience and discipline in the volatile market, masterfully balancing strategy and insight for success. This dedication to continuous learning is inspiring...managed to grow a nest egg of around 2.1BTC to a decent 15B TC in the space of a few weeks... I'm especially grateful to Janet Harold, whose deep expertise and traditional trading acumen have been invaluable in this challenging, ever-evolving financial landscape."
"Remember when the tariffs were ""an economic tool for negotiation""? That was funny."
"Tariffs should be viewed as a long-term strategic economic tool, with a focus on their sustained impact on trade dynamics and domestic industry development, rather than being assessed solely on short-term effects."
Lighthizer makes me embarrassed  to be an old white guy.
Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..
It’s the American greed of corporations and CEOs that cause the most trouble…Maybe make 298 Million a year in profits instead of 300 million and pay people correctly. Then that money stays here…
Haha. Just don't buy anything unless you truly NEED it.
This will cause a Great Depression.
"if tariffs are this bad, imagine how bad income taxes are"
"Imported cars, besides being affordable , are very reliable . American car  manufacturers cannot compete in reliability. If they change course we will buy more.  Sorry to say it, but most will buy a Honda or toyota because it last twice as long."
he is neither an economist nor an engineer...Just an outdated lawyer...
It will take years to raise the production inside America !
"I would love for some explanation how come the US can sustain a  near trillion  dollar trade deficit with China , Canada and  Mexico annually."
"Tariffs have some similarities to sanctions in some ways, because it impacts on the society at large (cost of living, job losses, cut on government budget such as health, education, crime, defense etc).   For over two decades my country Eritrea has been under crippling US & EU sanctions because they hated the government and they wanted to achieve regime change agenda.  But the sanctions only hurt poor citizens of the country denying them basic services and as a result causing some take the extreme measures to migrate to other countries.   
The west specially the US often applied sanctions to several countries using all sorts of reason to justify the sanctions.  Countries like Cuba, Zimbabwe, Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, and many more have suffered from evil US and EU sanctions.  If unless Western powers change their foreign policy to non-interventionist policy then there will always be migrants from countries that they sanctioned, coming to their shores.   The irony is majority of Americas and Europeans don’t understand the link between migration and Western interventionist foreign policy."
"This doesn't seem like a good gamble, but then again, i am pretty dumb. I hope small businesses are ready to take a good hit."
"Everything is already so expensive now, imagine in a month? We Americans are f."
I think this is going to teach Americans not to buy what they don’t need. Time to stop buying things you don’t need on temu or Amazon! Save your money you will need it!
"”And I will make boys their princes, and infants shall rule over them.“
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭3‬:‭4‬ ‭"
At this point in time. I will have to start backing the bolder in Colorado for US president.
Sounds like he mouthmated with RFK jr.
Raising tariffs on countries that already have tariffs on the US is not a horrible idea but there will be repercussions
Trade deficits or surpluses are neither inherently good or bad.  Thinking otherwise will lead to terrible economic policy.
A 25% tariff on Canada compared to a 10% tariff on China the producer of a vast amount of cheap crap to say the very least of the risks and problems with China is stupid and insulting.
Eff walmart
If you trust 60 minutes good luck to you
60 minutes is still on TV ? why?
"They need to exempt fruits and vegetables. People need to eat, there is not enough USA supply, this will really hurt children and the elderly and make chronic disease worse. Also very bad for small businesses & restaurants. At least give time for USA farmers to increase the supply, figure out their labor situations."
CBS didn't mention a word abt higher prices the last 4 years
I going to start avoiding the grocery store.Eggs cost $10 dollars this isn’t joke.
Can't believe all those trumpets clapping thinking china pays the tax 
Kinda huge boost to increase inequality. Riches will get more and more money.. Dead spiral like some ants do
I really think everyone should send a box of diapers to the White House because not only Trump is going to need them they're all going to need them
Time for the Rats to work harder in this Rat Race
He's scared of china
"Tariffs serve many purposes. Obviously some are positives, and some are negatives. It depends also on which side of the fence you are sitting at. 

Tariffs do buy time for the weaker, noncompetitive industries to catch up, providing some breathing space. But it should never be used as a ""fix-all"" snake oil. In fact, I would regard tariffs as ""band-aid"". It provides temporary relief, it shields the wound from sight, but it won't cure the wound. It covers up the wound to keep away the unwanted elements such as bacteria and dust, but that is all. 

The US industries are overly dependent on tariffs for their survival. Politicians who come and go at a regular 4 year interval, are dying for votes to get in the White House. So buying votes is not beyond them, and tariffs is just the perfect tool to do that. What the politicians are doing is to kick the can of ""very things to do"" further down the track, for the successive administration. Biden got the can from Trump, and now Trump is holding that can, and is doing the same. Not only is Trump creating more tariffs, he is also making enemies out of allies namely Canada and Mexico. As for Chyaannah...Trump is soft peddling because he knows it does have leverage over the US, I am talking about critical minerals."
We're smart Geniuses we elected president Trump
"It's time we keep our money in our country,rather than giving it to other countries and there people!"
"No sir, sharing wealth prevents wars. Full stop!"
Americans can keep their factories if they are willing to take a pay cut to compete with the international labor force. This is why manufacturing in the US is more focused on automation in the long term anyways.
"''Hey buddy, can i help you?''........Officer get me a dbl whopper w/ cheese, lrg fries n a Pepsi........LOL."
O 60 minutes a hard left news !
Tariffs are taxes on consumers.  Trump has no idea what tariffs are.
We sell them 150 billion then we buy 150 billion? That’s like giving somebody $50 shirt and in return they buy you $50 pair of shoes 
He's completely ignoring the fact that China's economy is cratering due to over production and too little domestic demand.
"Pure enjoyments without contributing anything to the world is all countries’ biggest enemy,"
My $2 dollar imported toilet brush will now cost $3.99. 
High tier workers and share holders will have to forgo some of their wealth to better support the working class. That’s a good thing.
"Trump 1.0 tariffs promised he would fix the trade deficit.  What happened?  Oh, yeah...we got higher prices, lost trade to other countries, had to bail out some of the US affected industries and he didn't fix anything.  So now we should expect that Trump 2.0 tariffs will work?"
"I'd like to tell the snobbish and haughty American politicuians of the Trump type, ""Wake up the times have changed; we're in the 21st century, and American gangster beghavior won't work as it used to...."
these guys might edit the answers to the questions. Lost credibility.
What does a multimillionaire know about the working class struggle 
"Robert's answer to the tariffs create layoffs question was such a typical ""I'm wealthy, I think it'll be fine"" answer."
Tariffs are costing the farmers to let crops rot because there’s no where to sell them again.
"Boy, the gift of gab is awesome ."
"The very basic truth is, you can't have cheap goods and high salary of making those goods at the same time."
He's from Reagan era with their trickle down economics - how'd that work out for you
"It would be great to see a lengthy video of Lovely and Lighthizer discussing the pros and cons of tariffs, and economic policy in general. In a cooperative and exploratory spirit, NOT trying to prove each other wrong and win."
"Then therefore, Walmart, should shut down "
How the hell could anyone think tariffs are a good idea?
"Lighthizer is our guy. He is absolutely right about trade relations we've held for a long time. It will cause pain, but this must be done."
We are headed for a depression aren't we??
Very interesting video thank you for sharing!
Both Canada and Mexico caved today  one day after this video was posted.
Well done
"I really think Trump knows what he's doing actually, God bless America regardless. Rahul Gupta completely transformed my life. I speak from experience: if you are having financial problems or looking to improve your finances, trust Rahul. He is someone you can fully trust"
"China's dominance of trade is largely due to the greed of US CEOs and shareholders squeezing maximum profit by moving manufacturing off-shore and basically giving US technology to the Chinese – who aren't stupid and take full advantage of the situation. It's not clear at all that tariff's can address the problem we have created for ourselves. We need to have incentives, regulations and above all, the educational system needed to train people for the jobs we're trying to bring back to the US. Unfortunately, regulations and investment in education seem to be very low-priority for the party in power, and tariff-mania looks to be very short-sighted and most likely ineffectual."
Man said in 10 years if it doesn’t work we can just go back…. This somebody they paid to analyze these situations for us saying this 
"I think we are in a temporary “snap back” period from far too many years of low interest rates, easy to get loans and the United States leading the world in devaluation of Labor. We have far too many burger joints and far too few manufacturing jobs that supply goods to the rest of the world. We will find out soon enough that Chinese and other nations can make a damn good product! Our choice is clear. Do we charge more for access to the American consumer (tariffs) and put down the burger spatula. Do we show up to work on time, sober, and off the govt. dole? Or do we increase transfer payments to favored groups and perpetuate the insanity of exporting our inflation to the rest of the world by trading “little green pieces of paper” for hard durable goods that float here from elsewhere?
This is of course my opinion and is in no way intended to support or critique any individual person or political figure."

"This is great. Yes goods will cost more but it’s meant to incentivize local production. And she says it’ll still go up, not if there’s enough domestic competition."
"So in theory if my local retailer are not paying me to shop at their store, I should stop shopping there, as there is a trade deficit. Our companies started moving to other countries in the 70’s. Labor was cheaper, CEO’s and shareholders wanted more profits, and wanted to comply with reductions in the pollution dumped in the US, and gave us safer air to breathe.  So let’s bring back pollution and lower wages."

Tariffs did not cause the Great Depression. Inflation did.
I agree with him but the problem is the physical infrastructure in the US isn’t there right now because manufacturing jobs left to go overseas decades ago.
Corporate greed for cheap labor created this situation

Why is 60 minutes not on Sunday!
Inspiring words at the end.
Why not have a direct tax on a manufacturer if they produce out of country. That would bring them back in a flash.
Tariffs are not a tax on a foreign country. The company who imports the goods to be able to sell in their stores or e-commerce site just passes on the increased cost to the consumer to protect their profit margin. Those are the facts.
I love nothing more than buying quality American made products.  But it’s hard to find them or find someone who sells domestic products.  It has gotten better over the last ten years I feel.
"I love the last comment because when it comes to economics, you should always be prepared that you may have been wrong."

"My recommendation to President Trump is to set a standard that all American producers must manufacture at least 60% of their products here in the US, and only allow up to 40% to go overseas. In addition, American manufacturers must keep all their machine tools here in the US."
American companies will see the higher prices of foreign goods on the shelves.....and follow suit. They can't miss out on corporate profits.
Walmart wouldn’t pay Tariffs If the US is making them. We need to export.

Corporate greed . Charge corporate greed
Greed caused all of this to begin with.  Large corporations need to be taught lessons about over charging us.... BUY LESS...lose weight.
Every family will be worse than before. A tariff passes to the consumer. The prices are up or there are not enough products. Tariffs are not the solution. This man is totally out of reality.
"CEOs are beholden to the shareholders - so their ""figuring it out"" will be to pass tariff costs onto consumers, raising prices to ensure the profit margin wont be cut into. Too high of prices then the market wont buy. Less sales = less profit. Less sales = layoffs and higher unemployment, tanking economy. And the majority VOTED FOR THIS."

"this only works if you can assume that CEOs aren't greedy, does anyone believe that to NOT be the case?"
Should be 300% tariff on China. Other countries have been imposing 300% tariff on imports from USA. We should return the middle finger.
"If tariffs are soooo bad for the consumers in the U.S. , then why does CHINA, MEXICO, CANADA, and all the rest of them not REJOICE? ... The threat of tariffs clearly worked against PANAMA, COLOMBIA and MEXICO for sure."

Y’all know what time it is.
"For God's sake... It is as simple as this: the company that imports goods from abroad to sell them in Murrica has to pay the tariff, consequently, it has to pass that cost on to consumers. Why can't the evil foreign producer be punished with tariffs? Simple: The tariff is paid by the importer and not by the foreign producing factory because the tax is applied at the time the merchandise enters the destination country, not in the country of origin.."
"Here is a question I always ask regarding trade deficits- who do we blame - the manufacturers who move to another country for cheaper labor, or the consumers who want those cheaper goods, ?"
It’s not a tax when it’s MADE in the USA … that’s the point …. We need more goods made in the USA
This guy thinks CEO's won't lay people off? How naive
Take away the competition and then US companies raise prices. Easier than taking millions to develop infrastructure to produce more. It gives US companies to gouge prices because they know consumers want products.

"I mean maybe we need to pay more. Were the most obese nation maybe less food would be a good thing. I used to make swords out of sticks played army with guns made of sticks spent all day outside played nintendo at night. We ate home cooked meals no mcdonalds no super walmarts no taco bell. Things were easier my Step dad made $6 a hour smoked marlboro reds drank budweiser had a nice bronco. My mom didnt work had a camaro he only made $6 a hour. That was only 45 years ago. The government and companies have sold us down the river for cheaper and less quality goods. Its everything its school,tv programs, cellphones have all made us less productive. Maybe tarrifs are not the answer but there has to be one."

Wall to wall coverage of tariffs AFTER the election. Where was the media during the election explaining this complicated subject????
"China Trade with the U.S can be explained with the ""The elephant curve"" is a graph that illustrates how different global economic classes have grown over time. The graph is shaped like an elephant, with the trunk representing the global elite, the torso representing the middle class, and the tail representing the extreme poor. Meaning the wealthy in America have benefited  from trade with China. Unlike in China where the poor working class benefited from trade with the U.S. If anything it's the top 1% fault why America lost so many jobs to China, they just took it when we gave it to them."

Trump 
Does he have that Kennedy throat 
"When they said “Trumps first tariffs on imported steel as intended, steel prices rose. US mills were protected, but the higher prices hurt steel buyers like car makers, economist estimate that the Tariffs created 1000 jobs in steel but cost 75,000 jobs among us companies overall” 

This is extremely misleading. Let’s break it down when you implement a tariff you are completely changing the supply chain.  So what happens? The people working in imports lose there job and have to change their direction. The wholesaler has to change and cuts out another middle man, the port in which it was being shipped through changes and on and on. So people lost there job yes but there is a shift in where the jobs are actually coming from. The other part “prices rose” well when you have 30% of all steel imported and are undermining the us manufacturers workers and wages and then add a tariff that creates a shortage or increases cost because it then takes time for hose company’s to bring their manufacturing back to the US and once in the US they then can compete on a level playing field in which would bring prices back down through competition. However we know prices won’t go down cause everything will only go up but it will grow the economy faster. 

And finally the big one. “Buyers like car makers and the loss of 75,000 jobs overall” well I hate to burst the bubble on this but when he implemented those tariffs it was March 2018 and showed signs of slow but steady growth and then a little thing call Covid happened and assembly lines stopped. 

To get this monkey off the American back we have to cut the cord to china and other countries that drag us down. The manufacturing jobs didn’t disappear over night in this country. US politicians let it happen over the past 40+years to pad their own pockets.

Trump is trying to get our country out from under the thumb of corrupt US politicians and government and out from under the control of horrible trade deals and make our economy rocket back by reducing spending (thank God for Elon Musk) and actually have a balanced budget and possibly a surplus so we can fund things like Medicaid and actually properly fund Social Security. To do all of this it takes significant out of the box thinking and strategy and you have to move fast because if you don’t people like these democrats that are watching their gravy train of USAID get gutted will be nothing but obstructionist and you only have 4 years. I haven’t seen politicians protest something like they are for USAID which is crazy because that money doesn’t go to the people they actually represent!"
"Buy less, and by from home ground."

Tariffs are needed.
Is the stock market's continuous desire for more a root cause in all of this debate? Increase revenues through increased pricing? People dislike inflation. Increase market size? People debate the pros and cons of foreign markets. Decrease costs? Shrink-flation. Cheaper labour. Cheaper materials.
"What a joke. You didn’t ask and he didn’t say…tariffs are like war -  easy to start, almost impossible to stop. Once a tariff is levied it’s there to stay."
"When President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the leaders of both countries immediately capitulated and gave in to his demands.

And it's not because they were worried that American consumers might have to start paying more."
"You guys suspiciously glossed over some more important points about these tariffs. 
The most important point is that the large companies have been doing what is called front loading. They are stocking up warehouses so that they can afford to add a buffer by stocking up local warehouses, and meanwhile their smaller competitors that also rely on imports are going to thrown out of business and eliminated as competition.
All in all, your budget Walmart and Amazon is going to be able to price them out further.
Small and medium business is and has been under threat. That's never good."
No more IRS. we need the ERS!!!.. Its time to bring back manufacturing to the US
It's really sad how people think that Tariffs are just taxing other countries. It is obvious that the companies are going to pass the high tariffs placed on them to the consumers! How can politicians think this is good for our country. It will cause the middle class to be totally wiped out. It will be like 2 classes. The very rich and the very poor.
"I live near enough to the Canadian border in Washington state to listen to their radio stations. I have been hearing call in shows daily on the topic of US tariffs. There are Canadian businesses protesting tariffs by refusing to work with the US now. The communities here, such as Bellingham, will see far less money spent from across the border. They are pulling out of existing relationships with the US right and left. Cancelling trips, anything that brings money to the US is subject to protest by individuals, businesses and corporations at this time. They are working to provide more of their own goods and looking for better options across the world for things they'll need to import. Canadians are rising to the challenge. Washington businesses and others that rely on Canadian dollars should prepare for upcoming major hits."
I am so bored of this as I have no control.
"Walmart, We're rolling up prices everyday!"
"We the Consumers will pay the high prices, stay tuned they are coming soon."
The average Chinese or Mexican worker is a minimalist. The average American worker isn't. Especially when they're already in tremendous debt.
This is the results of moving most of our manufacturing overseas . We let cooperate America do this to us now we are paying the cost.
"The person who purchases a product is the one who pays the tax, regardless where that product was manufactured. So, when Trump puts 25% tariffs on Canada, that 25% gets added to the cost of the product."
"I suggest when we mention the present China, please add ""Communist"" in front of ""China"", Communist China."
He is speeking the truth. It has nothing to do with anything but positivity for America. Has nothing to do with party
"Tariff is the way to recover the losses from reducing the taxes on the rich and corporations.
When Trump 1st reduced taxes, the corporations just bought back shares as well as fired many people and move their jobs to Mexico."
The problem is always caused by other countries.. Its never caused by our own Government and Politicians.

"""Will these very highly paid CEOs figure out how to make a profit"".... oh boy. Repeat that a few times over."
"This is a great thing. The idea is to have companies like Walmart buy their goods from USA industries and will encourage more USA businesses. I’m awaiting these things to take place so I can build my business here in the US. Trump also said that if my business is here, I will get a great tax rate. I’m just concerned with criminals stealing my products. Once Trump cracks down on theft, I’m opening my place. It will be awesome and create great value to my community."
"He's lying about that, we all have to pay higher taxes at the store for what we buy and the poor people will pay the price "
"It's cheaper to manufacture abroad, because the wage is higher in US. That's why US company moved factory abroad!!!"
Leave it to CEO's to figure it out?????
and we pay for the game they play…
So where did the view of “tariffs will hurt foreign countries because they would have to pay extra for goods brought into US” come from?? Tariffs have nothing to do with foreign suppliers? Never quite understood how tariffs work against foreign producers.
"The biggest issue right now is greedy corporations and greedy CEO’s.  These companies need to stop paying CEO’s millions and millions while paying workers Pennies on the dollar!!   It’s disgusting to watch companies penny pinch on payroll, while at the same time handing millions to the CEO!!  Stop bailing out companies then allow them to lay off half there work force!!   Bring back good paying jobs!!!"
He sounds like if RFK had a normal voice
"Even ""balanced"" trade increases costs on ALL consumers and will crater ALL economies!"
"Let me explain to this expert. Why Americans are losing their jobs is because labor is expensive in the US. People of the US wants to be paid high, work life balance and cheap everything.  You can't get best of everything realistically. So due to this, your American businesses migrated manufacturing outta US for cheaper labor. Theres just no way jobs will be back to US when labor is expensive."
"This guy really don’t care about the working class due to his words saying the CEOs will figure it out and not cut jobs to do so, he has  no rational thought on how CEOs will keep jobs and make a profit. Labor is a cost big corporations are always trying to cut, and they have a scapegoat to cut jobs and they will"
Look at that. 5 days later and they worked. Tariffs absolutely work for short term leverage when playing 4D chess. Trump got exactly what he wanted. MX and CN both capitulated in days and commited to working harder to keep their promise in keeping fentanyl out of the US. Good move.
"There is one important difference between what this man advises and what Trump is doing, which no one mentions. He advises imposing tariffs not on all products, but only on certain goods of strategic value. Trump, on the other hand, imposes tariffs on (almost) all products. That’s like cutting a sandwich with a chainsaw."
He said he was gonna...
Tell that to the millions of Americans that are used to cheap products that are imported from all over the world. Major inflation on the way for American consumers who are already struggling.
Use the tariff to create business here in the U.S.
"As someone who tries to understand different perspectives of an issue, I have taken some time to look at the past history of Robert Leitheiser and his views on tariffs - including reading his book on the subject.  In summary I would describe Leitheiser as one with a lot of hopes on tariffs will little proven personal success on the subject or any strong arguments on the subject.  His ask that we “try something different” at the end of piece is funny in that based on his work he really has no idea what will happen."
"You know what, there are probably a dozen things over the last decade that I regularly used to attack Trump for being ""wrong"" about. Turns out he was actually right about most of those things. It's taught me to ignore the media and their agenda, do my own research, and be open-minded to what the guy has to say and plans to do. Since I don't have a choice anyway, I'm going to wait and see on this one before condemning it based on my comparatively limited understanding of the subject matter."
It is indeed remarkable that I'm the while of the USA that all it can come up with as a strategist is people like Robert. Contrary to improving the USA's position it will only accelerate its decline.
"Well if the US needs them, then why has Pres Trump and Mexican Pres Sheinbaum worked something out to put off for 30 days tariffs on Mexico? You would think Trump would stick with this tariff that the US needs."
And the US just lost a true ally and friend in Canada with Trump’s 25% tariff and 51st state insults.

"Then why not to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, while lowering the ones of Canadian, Mexican, 3rd world countries' goods? wouldn't that be good blow to the Chinese hegemony?"
We just need buy less?
"Avoid tariffs and buy American made.

It'll be painful initially, but in the long run, America will be better for it."
"Long run, there has to be a strategy for the nation to employ its people"
"When Trump imposes the tariff, the supplier either stops selling to the USA or increases the selling price.  As such, the importers are paying the tariffs if they proceed to import them.  No one would want to make a loss, including both the importers and suppliers. As such, the increase due to tariff is passed on to the consumers."
You can’t beat the cheap labor in other countries. That is why these companies moved overseas in the first place. If the importer pays the tariff and passes it on to consumers this will be a disaster. Trump wants to pay for his massive corporate tax cuts. This is what this is all about.
"The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6, 1945 and August 9, 1945, respectively. These bombings marked the first use of nuclear weapons in war and ended World War II."

"Trump declaring tariffs being a taxon exporters is not Trump being ""mistaken.""

It is Trump declaring a bald-faced lie.

A tariff is a surcharge tacked on at the point of reception by the importing company or individual.  Can tariffs reduce the magnitude of exports? Yes. But can and do tariffs inevitably get consumed by the consuming public?

Uh - yeah"
"Firstly the USA govt needs to realise that they have given all the power to the financial services companies through a number of mechanisms, including the giant in the room called “markets”. So I cannot see how manufacturing industries will stop soon enough to chase lower wages/salaries for improved financial performance (both in financial and share performances). Secondly the USA has a declining population that is not supporting their industrialisation strategy, and further does not support demand and supply balances. Lastly, the tariffs strategy may go against WTO principles, which means the beginning of the end for necessary international bodies that were established to ensure balance in the world (in short it renders, WTO, IMF, World Bank, UN and its many bodies, and others irrelevant - something that BRICS and countries of the south have been complaining about anyway). It will be interesting to see how NATO’s economic and industrial status (let alone declining populations) will assist them without a proper engagement with the rest of the world"
"If Trump does not implement tariffs, then all these big companies/corporations will continue to take all the manufacturing jobs outside of United States, people in America are the one who are suffering their losing their jobs while these big companies reaps the benefits. It’s not right!"
"I'm sorry, but I don't have TEN YEARS TO FAFO!  I don't have the years and I don't have the money."
"This guy's clueless. A tariff was put on washing machines Trump's first time around. The goal was to give US manufacturers an opportunity to increase market share. The foreign machines were of course more expensive. Guess what? American companies raised their prices too and didn't increase their market share. Dryers went up too as they're typically sold with washing machines. There were no tariffs on dryers. Same for dishwashers and fridges. No tariffs and they all went up. Here in Canada we import close to $10k more per person than the US. We imported $440B in 2023 from the US, the US imported $480B from Canada. Do the math since the US has 290 million more people. Bottom line exporters and importers will always cut jobs, not profits. Always!"
"My instructor has been alluding to the point that Trump's tariffs are a good thing in one of my classes, or that ""they're a bargaining chip.""  I'm still not coming to the conclusion that Trump's threats have done anything at all."

"My question is, if china is the threat, why are the tariffs lower for them"
"Sure these tariffs will encourage more American manufacturing, but how many of us think it's going to create jobs?  With CEOs investing more than ever in robotics, AI and more affordable labor, they will cut out the expensive cost of human labor wherever possible."

"Why do have to buy from china?
Who made & why the American factories go to China,Canada & Mexico at the first place?"
"The trade imbalance is driven primarily by the excessive cost of doing business in America, I.e. our high wages, high benefits, high regulations, shorter working hours, vacations, etc.  As long as Americans refuse to work like slaves in a Foxcon iPhone factory, those manufacturing jobs won’t come back to America.  The alternative is. Having $3,000 iPhones, $80,000 basic trucks, etc. which nobody would buy.  Tariffs will not fix any of these issues."
"Tariffs: Taxes, higher costs on the consumer. HE PLAYED MAGA FANS LOL!!!"
I have been saying it for over a decade. Americans need to get out of debt and stay out of debt  Debt is the biggest issue.
Why be so scrutinizing of tariffs? Trump doesn't care about taxing other countries (though they will bear some of the burden from tariffs). He wants companies here to stay and build here and he wants companies that sell the the US to move here.
"Is Canada an existential threat? Isn't there a smarter move to even out our trade?

And to wait ""ten years"" to see if it works?"
Old rusty Brian started talking ! 
Companies will figure it out. By absolving business incorporation in America and just go outside.
It’s funny how Ronald Reagan gave him his first job at the White House because Ronald Reagan was very much for free and fair trade and not tariffs
"Tariff: 
Triggers saving money. 
Do we really need what they sell? 
Society says we need thier products? 
Save your money, let the supply go up. 
It will lower prices again. ️"
"Because taxs are too high. Thats nothing is build here.   Who make the number one corn soybean, in the world yet no one buys from us.  Ding"
"What this guy is saying makes sense but it's about China, not about Mexico, Canada or EU.
China has 1.4 billion people, even if they get to half of the US GDP per Capita, they'll be twice as big as the US economy wise. 
The US is alienating its friends, not the way of decreasing the economic strength of China, it's the opposite."
"Basically the Left says, ""no tariffs, cheap goods and who cares about American jobs being lost."""
"foreign vehicles are more dependable and made than domestic vehicles. GM, Ford and Chryslers are not as dependable and the quality is subpar."
And how would high tariffs affect prices in the US?
U S business's went to China to capitalize on cheap labor and nonexistent environmental restrictions at that time. Thanks a lot President Nixon.

Tariffs are a direct payment to the US Government which is to Trump and his cronies. The cost will then be added to the food and merchandise we buy.
"I’m concerned as I would be with any large change. I’m going to hold off on drawing any conclusions until I see what happens. 

The US could end up with higher inflation and higher  interest rates as a result. However, this could also cause higher unemployment, which will bring down interest rates. I realize there are other factors at play but I’m just pointing out the area that I know. 

The only thing happening for sure is that some industries and their workers will suffer. One side says they’ll suffer for the greater good and the other says they’re the tip of the iceberg of economic doom. 

At this point we have little impact on what happens."
"When you fail to compete, you should try to do better rather than blaming other for being too good. No one force you to buy, you buy and then blame the other, are you insane or stupid?"
"1. China doesn't sell fentanyl, it sells precursors.
2. Fentanyl is an important painkiller used globally in hospitals.
3. China sells precursors legally and ethically globally.
4. Only North America has a drug abuse problem.
5. Stop blaming China for your problems."
No body steals our jobs we gave them with both hands....or exploit of cheap labor.
"Tariffs are the Apex of Socialism.

Tariffs = Government regulation of prices and markets

Tariffs = Raise prices and reduce competition

Tariffs = Dumb

Economics 101"
"For 60 minutes to point at the great depression, and to state tariffs were the reason it happened is crazy.  No manipulation by JP Morgan and others crashing the stock/bond markets?... no mention of the ""federal reserve""... really?"
What allies? You are alienating all of them…
"60 Minutes should look at the bigger picture.  Our nation has to cut our expenses.  Illegal immigration is a really big expense.  Theses tariffs are meant to draw attention to that.  Also, we need to even our how we trade."
US companies in China are expanding rapidly. Starbucks open 2 to 3 new stores a day in China. Their economy is expanding faster than the US and most other countries. They want to import about $US two Trillion worth of goods this year. What a pity the US is wanting to limit the amount it sells to China.
What happened to Trump’s tariffs on Mexico and Canada?
"The company didn’t invest , innovate , just kept taking the money out , the Chinese didn’t steal the tech you gave it to them , apple phones a great example,"
"""the genius of america combined with our allies"" what allies brother if you tariff everyone you will have 0 allies lol"
This guy doesn't want to acknowledge that it's corporate greed that caused the trade deficits. This guy is just promoting bullying and scapegoating to confuse people about who is to blane.
I trust 60 Minutes!
Not difficult people.  Stop sending profits to the top. Money freely moves profits out of communties.  Companies are financially incentivized to maximize profits for shareholders.  Why are workers and the communities not recipients of profits? Paychecks arent profit.
"Correction, Canada and Mexico capitulated and chose not to apply retaliatory tariffs and agreed to send 10,000 troops to the border (each!) to limit illegal border crossings and drugs"
So much for congress having the purse strings of the country. What a joke.
How edited is this?
Mutual benefit trade.  A concept too difficult for Trump.
7:50 that makes no sense
"Drain the swamp. America first! Stop printing money we don’t have.
America can no longer afford to be the generous big brother."
"All trade leads to here , in fact tariffs are a tool."
How are we to be sure this isn't edited for effect?
Then why China is tariffed only 10% yet US ally Canada gets hit with  25% ?
I wanted to check in on 2/3/2025 to see how everything was going and if anyone's prediction came true.
i would just do a vat tax on foreign goods same concept
So the american companies loose money on foreign imports; they will also raise prices on items sold to compensate for lost revenue.
200 a month to make America great again ??…. Sounds like a good investment
"Tariffs will punish the consumers. That is precisely their intention. America is in debt, more so its consumers, due to conspicuous consumption. This will force them to prioritize spending, and cut down on debt. The rest, who couldn’t manage, will be on the soup line. Tough love from Trump."
"How the previous US (Trump) Trade War against China played out during 2018
BACKFIRED️
1. Tariffs imposed by Trump: 250 Billion
Total Chinese goods imported into the US: 539 Billion.
2. Tariffs imposed by China: 110 Billion
Total US goods imported into China: 120 Billion.

"....But If I chose not to get the item ""I will not pay the tariff/tax"" that Walmart chose to pass on to the consumer. Still like my odds with the idea that I have a choice in what I want. U.S. made or ""Made in China""...HMMM!"
Same reason why the war on drugs was a failure.
"You know the 'Bad deal, very bad deal"" with Canada that he wondered who made the bad deal. It was him trump who made the deal on the 30th November 2018. Afterwards whech he said was the greatest deal ever with Canada ""Great deal"" he said anout it"
Remember you voted for Trump This is what you get
"All the companies are selling too expensive, that is why they are making billions of dollars so few billions less not hurt those companies. CEO are making millions. Is it time to stop the people paid for everything."
Did he say allies ?
"4:31 It's a bummer to lose $120K grossly overinflated income/benefits.
All that is just for looking at cars on a line."
"Went to walmart today and man it was the best time ever. No ill ALIENSS anywhere! No one knocing you over, buying up all the juice not leaving one for the next person! man trump is a great guy for the american people and its feeling like america again! This so great for us americas get them out of here"
"10:04.  The highly paid CEOs will have to start increasing employees’ salaries. Dramatically. There’s no reason for one person to make 10s -or  100s - of millions of dollars a year. Let that profit flow to the workers. Then they can afford to buy the more expensive American made products,  and then the workers of those companies can hire more workers and pay them decently. A rising tide lifts all boats."
They didn’t retaliate they Fold
China will stay assured and feel safe when the USA president has these type of blind advisors. Well done. Keep going
The US Army is the only one that can fight a war on its own. So while China has the biggest army in the world does not necessary mean they are the strongest.
"I really want to emphasize that we are way past the nineteenth-century; global trade is not simply importing raw materials to manufacture finished good.
We import raw materials, WIPs (works-in-progress), components, and finished goods and export eaw materials, WIPs, components, and finished goods.
There is a good article from the WSJ that covers a bathtub manufacturer in Utah, whose bathtub is made with ~1,850 parts received from seven countries and fourteen states. Some parts, like the water pump, travel through multiple countries before ending up in the Utahan factory.
We can not simply throw a tariff on a country and expect jobs to come back; we simply disrupt the entire supply chain and may be forced to purchase from another country because we do not have and never have had the production for a certain component.

EDIT: I want to clarify that I am not a free-trade shill and do think that it was a good decision to abolish NAFTA and implement the USMCA, which streamlined all trading, cut obstacles for small goods, and recognized the digital and environmental changes of the 21st century.
These new tariffs throw all that away."
HOw does Lighthizer not get asked about the increase in Farmer Suicides and Bankruptcies after the first Trump tariff effort against China resulted in a retaliatory tariff which cost US farmers the China Soybean market?
We need to return to rerm limits and constitutional money. NO MORE DUAL CITIZENSHIP.
200 is better than thousands
Why is this guys voice just like Warren Buffet?
It was good business having cheeper lador. Maybe you should have stopped this from happening 30 years ago
Tariffs for China are for american company to come back home
"The loss of American manufacturing has led to a significant increase in the income disparity between those with and without college degrees. Carefully structured, targeted tariffs on particular goods could incentivize companies to increase manufacturing capacity in the USA which would create more manufacturing jobs but not as many jobs as people think. Companies would still try to keep costs down by reducing the number of staff hours required to operate factories. AI did not exist 70 years ago during the American manufacturing boom. AI will allow factories to be much more automated than they have ever been. This means they won't actually create that many more jobs for people who don't have college degrees. You'll still need a post-secondary degree or higher to work in an automated factory. Tariffs are inflationary. They are literally designed to discourage the consumption of foreign made goods by making it harder for the companies importing them to compete with American made goods."
China pays it if importers have to reduce their price for US consumers to buy it.
60 minutes nope. Will never trust em if even they get it right 1 time out of 500.
"The only problem my friend, or one of the many your boss has created, is that you are losing your allies."
Tariffs did not deliver? Look what happened
"In 10 years if failed, try again! Cannot believe he said that. It’s people’s livelihoods and children’s future you are talking about. And in 10 years, China will have moved further ahead."
This boat has sailed. Why should China not pull ahead if they manufacture more? Tariffs are a tax on Americans. Duh.
"This guy has never taken an economics course, cost accounting and supply chain management class.  He doesn’t understand things like comparative advantage and economies of scale."
"Steel was a very bad example to use because Chinese steel was cheap, but it was complete junk.
I had to reject Chi ese 'I' beams because the quality was so bad, they could not be used AT ALL!"
"I am a Trump supporter however, I think taxation on another country equals war. But I do feel we need to bring jobs back to America and put America to work again that’s what needs to be done. I don’t think tariff some other countries is the way to go."
Even if it costs us more we need things in the United States made here
"we do to China what they do to us? They have cheaper labor, they have a rising middle class, they have 1.4 billion people. we don't. We are not the same."
"For the last few years, even without tariffs, the macro economy if the US has been just fine .  Americans really do not have any idea how good we have in comparison to the rest of the world. We are economic snowflakes.  The issue is not that we don't have enough resources.  The issue as perfectly described by Warren Buffett is how they are distributed. We are blaming poor Chinese workers who simply took jobs for the incessant greedy behavior if our corporations.  Blame the right source and stip beating up on China and other poor countries for the greed of our multinational companies. Understand how to solve the right problem instead of blame fixing."
Why is 60 mins doing editorial hit pieces on the presidents positions?!
It just started just wait it out and see
"It will hurt temporarily, but nothing happens overnight. More domestic  manufacturing as the cost of overseas goods cost increase and are less available. Im middle class business owner I pay health insurance for my folks, and the cost of goods sold is 18 percent higher. We need to do things differently, or  the next generation will not have any chance. Entry homeownership is between 200k and 300k. Ask yourself, especially if you have kids, what will it take for them to be prosperous."
Who has 10 yrs to throw against the wall?
"He talked  about Chinese espionage as if the US had done less espionage than the Chinese. Laughable, shameless, sickening!"
"False. Tarifs would make selling goods more expensive for the Chinese. If it used cost them 1$ by 25% tarifs it’d now be 1.25$. Now an American company that can manufacture the same good for 1.2 will have a domestic edge. The price will eventually jump by 20% however now the American company is producing so the economy of scale will bring down their price to let’s say 1.1$. So finally the price jumps by 10c and now you have a manufacturing base that is producing more which means more money in the workers pocket for example 50c on a dollar. So a 10c increase is offset by Americans having 50c in their pocket. That’s strengthening the dollar not inflating  it.
Tarifs in long term will strengthen the dollar and strengthen the American economy."
60 minute is wrong again! Both Mexico and Canada now comply with Trump’s request.
"Extremely risky and predicated on prior American economic independence. Like many have said, we're starting with hurting the closest relationship with our allies and that's not a viable long term strategy. I want America to thrive so badly once more but this seems like too blunt a tool and too short term in scope. Especially dealing with a rival like China."
How is the sound quality so abhorrent when it is a big production? I've heard better in bars!
Tariffs should have to be paid by the manufacturers in China to be able to bring the goods into our country. If not they can’t sell them here.
Sounds like Belvadre shouldnt received that GRANT
This is similar thinking that was bandied around by the proponents of Brexit. Brexit categorically has failed. Utter chaos. Stagnation and inflation. Massive closure of small and mid sized businesses. The largest businesses moved abroad. It's foolish to leave this for CEOs to figure out. What a mess!
Cool
"Strategic decoupling means we become an isolated fortress. 
That's where we were before WW1. We slipped back into a ""don't mess with me"" posture and sought uneven trade advantages after WW2. By isolating, we can't compete on goods manufactured in the US that other countries won't buy since they get a lower price elsewhere. We then can only sell our goods internally. This dooms both a nation and an empire. BRICS is a good way to show our leaders that our path is wrong. Our leadership is ruining the US. They can't see that the global power structure is changing."
"Once again, it always starts with Reagan"
Basically he is about how to give as much money to billionaires as possible as we can at the expense of everyday Americans.
"Boing has an executive that makes 32 million a year, that 40 US President salaries?"
"Americans need to appreciate...

Other countries including countries in Europe, do not hold China in the same measure of disdain and dread as do Americans. Going country by country, especially given the present political climate in the United States, I'd say it would be at least a coin flip as to which between China and the US any given country might perceive as the more attractive trade partner. And not just because China's population size force multiplies its influence."
"He can say these things with the confidence of a man that does not realize he is not that smart. He said things that people wanted to hear. Now, we are stuck with economists that are stuck in philosophies of the past. Tariffs are not the answer. Plus, I realize tariffs can be a negotiating tool. However, they don’t work. China controls more things than this guy realizes. We don’t need his outdated ideas. We need ideas that will carry us into the future. While we pay for this, the wealthy will get richer and we will get poorer. That’s their game plan - creating an unshakeable dependence on the wealthy, even more so than we are now."
Bring the manufacturing to the USA SHAZAAM…..NO TARIFF
"China has at least 10 times the number of highly trained engineers as the US does.  Their innovations are off the charts,  most Chinese that drive cars, drive EVs that are better than Teslas, charging in 10 minutes and with greater range;  better smart phones,  AI equivalent to the US AI at 10% of the US cost, massive hydro electric, etc.   WTF, they take our printed money.  Let's just kick back and buy their stuff and have a universal basic income "
This will happen all over the country.
"So what's Ms. Lovelyy's crystal ball tell her happens when all US manufacturing and heavy industry is imported from a national security perspective?  How does the US justify it's position in the world when it only leads in 'financial innovation' that regularly causes catastrophic economic disruptions, online sports betting, online market places that ship and sell Chinese goods, and social media platforms which has everyone perpetually looking at their phones?"
"He’s a trade lawyer from the Reagan area, two things why he is not longer qualified for an economist’s job.  He can’t see the forest through the trees.  Bring young economists to take over this job,  his ideas are antiquated.p and can’t see further than what’s in front of him.  The fact he’s a talker says a lot about his flaws.  He is unable to listen and learn something new in a new world.  This isn’t the world trade of the 80s."
"This guy sounds like a fool, the best way to stop wars isnt your military it is being reliant on each other economically so there are no incentives for war."
Getting rid of manufacturing jobs is the best thing we could do for this country. Why is the richest country on earth going to put our citizens through the dangers of working with heavy machinery in less than safe working conditions vs. let China do it and net all Americans with cheap goods that are basically a tax cut.
Anyone watching in 2024 ?
This is a serious shift in power Trump is going to learn the hard way Africa was been oppressed by IMF and the world for years
You can tell he doesn't sleep well...
I wonder if 60 minutes edited this i interview too ?
"Greed and peace by strength is what got us in to this situation, peace by strength may sound good, but its an illusion and does not work, greed, well you  can blame that on big manufacturing companies and big profits, making enough profits wasn't enough, they wanted a lot more, and when a government runs a country like a business, it will always fail."
if china is the threat then why not put a 25% tariff on them too?
"The claim she made about there being no competition after tariffs push Chinese ptoducts out is absolutely false. There are often multiple domestic competitors, as well as other (non-Chinese) foreign competitors."
"Why do they equate ""foreign goods"" with ""Chunese goods""? Why can't we switch to relatiins from Chuna with their territories to other countries without? It's painful for the next 4 years and then boom we have other countries or ourselves. This is dumb"
meanwhile china is getting all of our 5090's from the communist owner of nvidia.
"Blah! Blah! Just call back all the companies that went to China, or Messico, to produce and they then sell to the americans. Produce here, not abroad. Sell your products to them."
12:30 is SPOT ON
NAFTA sent jobs across borders on the cheap.
All the cost will go to American...
Electric cars are the problem.
What is this guys educational background
"""I believe in tariffs as an economy measure"" is automatically disqualifying yourself from being an economist. if not you wanna ruin your own countries economy in this day and age. 
decoupling, ok that is a fair argument - but when you think 'slap on a tariff and it'be fine' ... well, nope."
Our trade into Canada is less than 3% GDP .. good luck Canada
“You don’t know how much you love to going to work until you can’t going there anymore” . This is the key of why the jobs are lost ! Look at how works in any Asian countries you will see the biggest differences are the way people work! In China the competition among workers and factories are so much more intense than here !  And people  have less government welfare to rely on . They do their best to put their future in their own hands !
Total BS...tariffs destroy economies.
Who is ‘we’.
"tariffs are supposed to be a temporary cost for a long term benefit. The idea that tariffs will bolster domestic industry and production and lead american consumers to buy domestic goods would be valid if WE ACTUALLY HAD DOMESTIC INDUSTRY, these companies have allready outsourced the vast majority of production and labor to foreign countries so in the end all this is going to do is lead americans to pay more for things they have to buy from foreign producers , because there are no american producers that produce them. domestic products will also go up as companies only care about profits, not empowering the american worker.  corporations got us into this muck by outsorucing everything, and we were complicit in it when we fell in love with cheap foreign goods and continued to consume with no thought or foresight into how this would lead to a long term decimation of the american economy"
There is a problem and it needs fixing. Fixing the problem comes at a price. You either pay the damn price now and work on fixing the problem or you pay it later when the enemies of the US are running your damn country. Who will you whine to then?
"When Trump rambles on about fentanyl and foreign countries paying the tariffs, it scares me to no end. How can this work? He’s making no sense. When Lighthizer explains it, I’m like “0k, I’m listening”. It still feels like we’re playing with fire."
So it’s the other nation fault but not greedy industries!  Let them big companies fail I say
"That’s his answer go back in 10 years lol, so make the American people pay more, sounds just like trickle down economics "
"they never answer teh obvious question. if tariffs are so bad then why does the EU and China have massive tariffs against us? we are the ONLY major country that does not have them, so again explain this. why don't all these terrible things happen anywhere else?"
stealing job... there are 1 million farm jobs At this moment... when are they going ot get filled?   not any time soon
"This clown said that China is a threat to us because they are successful. 
Basically what he said is, I’m a multimillionaire and I do not want this to affect my 150 foot yacht. He’s not worried what happens to the rest of us normal people he’s just worried about his 150 foot yacht."
"Free Ports fellow travelers. Dug into that part of tariffs today and was amazed. We have balance of trade blah blah and we have a world system of Free Ports which do not pay tariffs on goods traded all over the world beside ports/airports where imports have imposed tariffs. There are at least 3,500 Free Ports/airports world wide where tariffs don't apply. This causes me much confusion about why the two trade systems exist and do we have free trade/minus tariffs with Canada and Mexico or what? Why is the media not addressing Free Ports and these so called controversial current tariffs at this time? You can go online and find out all about Free Ports, lists of all the ports what they are about etc but nothing in the blah blah zone about why we wouldn't need to impose tariffs on any country. So are we just bleeding hot air in this bloodless war currently heating up our media waves ? Enlighten me please."
"Tariffs affect more USA citizens that the others 3 countries, they can survive easy, we not"
What a lier... No questions asked for a journalist
Well time for US to fall on their own hubris....
Is there going to be a 60% tariff on Trump bibles from China?
Can anyone help me understand how one can pursue a tariff strategy and at the same time fight inflation? And second how <whales are being driven crazy by windmills> because it comes from the same person.
"these guys who impose tariffs also wants to have gov subsidize big corporations, basically funnelling tax money to the rich. This canadian tariff is also likely drafted by elon to hit back at his competitors"
What will stop us from the EU...and me specifically as a tiny company...to buy from China instead of USA? If Trump decides to put tariffs on EU also? Because EU will undoubtedly put tariffs also. I am talking also about Canada and Mexico. Swiss Army knives are still 100% Swiss made. The most expensive country in the world. What gives? I think XI put out a party yesterday!
"This guy has never taken an economics course, cost accounting and supply chain management class.  He doesn’t understand things like comparative advantage and economies of scale.  And this idea that we have been failing our way, yes, failing our way all to being the largest economy in the world."
I listened to this interview and everything he said is wrong tariffs might work in certain circumstances but the tariffs that Trump has put on Canada and Mexico are just plain stupid and the American people are the ones who will suffer because of his total lack of knowledge
"Are there still bridges to return to when one says - ""If it fails, we can always go back"" ?

If there ars bridges, will it have the same strong foundation as before? If it was burned, how sure can one be that the other party is willing to make it stronger knowing   one has the capacity to burn it again just like before?

It is nice to try new things but in life, relationships matter as much as money that feeds you to survive."
"What people are not understanding is that those countries have a one way advantage in trading when it should be and equal trade.  China, Mexico and Canada cannot sell their goods to their own citizens and make the same profits they make selling those goods to the USA.   Therefore those countries need the USA more than the USA needs them.  The closing statement is the best argument anyone can ever make... the current way has been failing for decades if something new isn't tried than we will continue to fail economically."
Blame Canada
We had the same exact problems with Japan in the 80's. Just another Yellow scare. Yawn
"I find Trump vile, but his motive for stopping the flow of fentanyl is honorable. As a retired RN, I’ve seen the wreckage firsthand. Still, even his voice is repugnant to me."
"At the End, 13:30, he never said tariffs was right!!!! GREAT DEPRESSION 2025 TO 2030."
"You are 10-20 years too late, the Chinese engineering students have already been educated at US universities and have gone back to China to develop new technologies. BYD and Huiwei, DeepSeek, and the semiconductor industry. Time to invest in US students and tax the American companies offshoring US manufacturing jobs."
"The one thing he is forgetting is over the last 50 years Americans have become lazy round and incompetent. In today's day if it says made in the USA it's more than likely a crappy product because the company is maximizing profit over quality. Like teslas rc cars, they don't care how bad it is as long as they can take your money.

As an engineer I'm taking my knowledge and my money and going elsewhere. Going to a country who wants to work with other countries who wants the human race to succeed and cares about their citizens. The ones who are going to be left in this country will not have the skill set to build anything. The only thing that this is going to do is make the rich richer while the rest of us pay extra for basic needs.

I wish the mericants the best of luck, but being this naive ALWAYS ends horribly."
"as long as US continues producing such under educated Politicians and govt officials, US 's decline is inevitable！"
Trump utterly lost the last trade war when he had to pay $60 billion and pay out to farmers
You all want to stay weak. We're trying make things better for our children and grandkids
"This ship has already sailed. American companies sent jobs to China for cheap labor and higher productivity. Now, they know all we know and manufacture much cheaper. How are you going to win? We can create same trade rules for them as they have for us but not sure we can compete with China when it comes to manufacturing. I do believe that China will struggle with Quality and may struggle with quality for a while but they can catch up there too. We still have the edge on Quality I think ."
He suggests socialsist plan economy where the government decides what to buy.
We're doomed!
I lost braincells listening to this.
Define a few people?
"Softball interview and the guy struggled with it. Is this Trump's idea of hiring ""the best people"""
"He has passion but he has no idea what to do, therefore resulting in blunt instruments"
"I believe that we also have 3 generations of lazy kids who don't know how to get off the couch. And go to work. Maybe when they're parents stop supporting them, they will find a real job"
Greed greed of the tyrants how is this not obvious?
China doesn't have the biggest army nor navy in the world. The USA has.
"TWO big problems here.  1. Trump isn't talking about just targeting China or only applying limited tariffs on a specific sector that needs protected from foreign dumping.  He is talking about universal tariffs on all imports, even from our allies and countries that we have tried to boost economically as part of stopping illegal immigration.  2. It sickens me to hear this man who won't feel a bit of pain in his personal life from the disruption and high prices many of us will struggle with if he gets his way just shrug off the harm this will do to so many by saying we could just switch back in a decade if it doesn't work.

I suggest people read up on the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the early 20th century that led to the Great Depression. If he follows through on his plans, we could be looking at something very similar.

It's not that I completely disagree with the idea of relying less on China to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  But placing tariffs on ALL imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  INSTEAD of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from North, Central, and South America, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a US company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the U.S.  It would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  It would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the U.S. for work.    It would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the Panama Canal, because U.S. and Canadian imports from Mexico, C.A. and S.A. could come by train.  But Trump is the President now, so I guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve OUR (not just HIS) goals.  It would also ensure that those Central and S. American countries stay aligned with us instead of becoming more entwined with China.  Right now, it seems like Trump is pushing countries AWAY from us and TOWARDS closer economic and political ties with China"
Its a bargaining tool..
"China's new rare earth policy, implemented through the ""Rare Earth Management Regulation,"" essentially declares all rare earth resources as state property, tightening control over mining, refining, and export of these critical minerals, effectively giving the Chinese government significant power to regulate the global rare earth market, including potential restrictions on export technologies and quantities to protect national security and interests; this policy took effect on October 1, 2024  So , America will make fewer semiconductors because of this, thanks Trump."
Will Trump really grow our Navy this time? Last time Trump said he would greatly increase the size of our Navy. Instead we got just 1 more Navy Ship in the 5 year budget than we had at the end of Obama's term. Admittedly----Congress controls the purse strings----and may not let us grow the Navy. I have no clue----but hope Trump pushes his congress for more ships this time.

"What they aren't factoring in is the cost to transport goods from overseas. I thought we cared about the environment? Why are we shipping basic goods from China that can be produced here? We also have a lot of red tape to build factories which should be improved with deregulation. Start up costs have to be improved. Then you have to factor in economies of scale. Prices would improve over time. Wages then increase over time. Once production in the US ramps up, we now how an eco friendly and competitive product, wages are higher, it's American made, quality products return and they could be cheaper in the long run via automation and economies of scale, with lesd transport costs. Depending on the product, this ramp up of production could happen relatively quickly."
"Anybody fact check this guy? He never worked as a paperboy, nor waited tables to put himself through school. What does he know about the average American?"
"The problem the US had with China is that free trade between big businesses no longer works to contain communism.  Communists and their socialized state-owned businesses posing as corporate ones like Jack Ma's have a much better reach with inexpensive good quality products sans the fringe benefits usually accorded to huge corporate businesses owned by the few who earn huge profits.  The windfall does not precipitate to a bigger population but is limited to the industry where the big business operates.  Thus, few benefit from it.  On the other hand, the more frugal state-owned business distributes fairly evenly to the larger populace.  That is why with good quality inexpensive retail consumer goods, which China targets, more people are liking Made in China goods."
"Exaggerated and one sided. This is capitalism and free market economy. The American ""entrepreneurs"" and ""businessmen"" used cheap labor in China to make products and bring them home for larger profits, and now you are complaining about this free market economy? You can't have cake and eat it too. You can't expect other countries to be your cheap labor forever. They can learn and do the same thing. 
Now, placing tariffs on products that you no longer make will only cause inflation. Placing tariffs on products that your country makes could be useful if it does not encourage your own manufacturer to bring down quality."
"Whether or not China pays for the tariffs - or Wall Mart pays them ( WMT will pass costs onto consumers ) depends on who produces quality goods at the lowest cost. If US can produce at low enough costs to make Chinese products comparatively unattractive, then china will have to eat the tariff in order to sell in US, and visa versa.
But since US labor costs are too hi - China will be able to pass tariff costs onto Wall Mart, and US consumers will end up paying.
So how can Trump keep manufacturing costs down? By keeping labor costs down.  It's the ""Gilded Age"" of McCarthy  come back to life. It will be a race to see who can manufacture with the lowest labor costs and has the highest demand  that will determine who eats the tariff."
You don’t know how much you love to going to work until you can’t going there anymore . This is the key of why the jobs are lost ! Look at how works in any Asian countries you will see the biggest differences are the way people work! In China the competition among workers and factories are so much more intense than here !  And people  have less government welfare to rely on . They do their best to put their future in their own hands !

I wonder how many lies 60 minutes is gonna tell this time
All conjecture here...................
This guy is living in a long gone fantasy world.
Thank you Wall Street Journal for exposing the truth about these tariffs and tariffs in general. We need more common sense reporting on these new economic blunders that are blindly accepted by these naive fanatics of the dirty old limo looney.
You are only hurting the bottom line of companies. Companies will still make money just less of it and if they are wise they will invest into capital.
"How many CEOs care about workers? They care about profits first, then everything else, or they aren’t capitalists. If profits are squeezed, they look for ways to cut costs,,  mostly automate, use lower priced materials, or lower wages. Automation may create some jobs, but most likely which don’t involve the skill set of those laid off.  Unless profits no longer matter, tariffs won’t benefit very many Americans. Those laid off will need to change locations, or carriers, or both."
"Lighthizer, just like Trump doesn't even know what he's talking about. And I can't believe the president of the USA made that speech about tariffs hurting the exporting countries. These are the people who run this country. R.I.P."
"I'm tempted to sent some money and a letter of apology to both the presidents of Mexico and Canada letting them know that not all of us Americans are blaming, lying & criticizing idiots like those who infest our federal government these days.  Its the least I can do since I am now being defrauded of my own money that our own government requires me to pay to them  (via tariffs) for boarder protection they are not doing as they demand Mexico and Canada do all that work for us."
If the Trade war does not dissappear then Manufacturing will move back to the US but Tesla Bots and Boston Dynamics Robots are cheaper then American Salaries.
I get what he is saying he is cutting out the middle part (you have to get the companies started and they have to be successful this will take time could be a long time) also he is cutting out the greed part alot of these companies are not dully staffed now to think they will be fully staffed just because all the products come from America is wishful thinking but i doubt it CEO or owners are not taking a pay cut period
He's been around since Reagan???? explains a lot about US goes to ....for tariffs always pay people!!!! high wages never make cheap product...
"Why Donald Trump's tariffs are not likely to bring Americans a durable benefit:

Eroding Trust Among Trade Partners: Tariffs create a rift between countries, making it harder to build strong, trusting relationships that are crucial for long-term economic growth.

Fueling Division and Tribalism: Instead of fostering unity, tariffs can deepen divisions, pitting groups against each other and creating a climate of hostility that can hinder cooperation.

Misallocation of Resources: The financial and human resources spent on implementing and managing tariffs could be better invested elsewhere, like innovation and infrastructure, which genuinely drive growth.

Driving Up Prices for Consumers: Tariffs often lead to higher costs for everyday products, making life a little tougher for families trying to make ends meet and pushing inflation in the wrong direction.

Empowering Authoritarian Regimes: By prioritizing tariffs over diplomacy, there's a risk of unintentionally bolstering authoritarian leaders who thrive on nationalistic sentiments, undermining global democratic values.

Promoting Short-Sighted Self-Interest: The focus on immediate gains can overshadow the need for sustainable practices, leaving a legacy of greed that prioritizes profit over people and planet."
"Much of what he states is factually untrue.  Real story is that Trump did not hire him in second term, so he does this to audition for a job offer.  Sad."
Tariff is just a soft term to tax the ordinary people!..its the people who will bear the burden not companies..big companies built manufacturing plant in china/india not US..if their products getting 25% tariff it still worth it than to open manufacturing plant in US..good luck americans 
Reading the comments show the ignorance of the audience for 60 minutes.
Maybe stop looking at economics as a competition and realize that if you reach an equilibrium where China’s labor force no longer is a cheaper alternative then things balance out. Capitalist businesses will always seek to use the cheapest labor. As nations mature their labor force becomes more expensive. It’s the cycle. Eventually manufacturing will find its way to Africa and so on. The key is to keep evolving your workforce to meet different needs.
Blame the ceo s
"Oooo poor trumpist people,,"
"That guy talks about americas allies. 
If Trump moves forwards anerica doesnt have any allies left"
These guys are crazy.
"It is capitalism, the capitalists wants to maximize profits, and they will find one way or another to find the cheapest solution."
China view itself is a developing country.
tariffs are a tax on a foreign country like for example if there's a tax on Huawei the importer pays the US government not china those taxes making Huawei more expensive and less competitive.  Its not as if china is receiving that money.
"Wait. What? American CEOs are going to have to figure out how to cover the cost of tariffs? But their whole thing--schlump and his cronies--is that Mexico, Canada and China will bear those costs. So, which is it Bob? Interesting that he was appointed by Reagan. We all know how Reagan's economic policy worked out for the middle class. Oh, it used to be that the average American family used to have at least one full-time employee in their family and even though there was just one main earner, most of those families could afford to pay their mortgages, buy school supplies and groceries, and buy the occasional car and take the occasional family vacation without having to sacrifice any regular stuff like medicine (they had health care back then). It was called the Middle Class. It was a pretty nifty thing for families until Ronald Reagan, yes, the actor, and, probably this buffoon here, Lighthizer, ideated that wealthy corporate owners could be given huge tax breaks to ""invest in their employees and business infrastructure"" and then pass the new financial windfalls they'd get and eventually got, down too the dedicated men and women who had those great, secure jobs that kept them in the Middle Class. They called it ""trickle down economics. It was sold as manna from heaven for the regular worker and family but turned out to be a bunch of wealthy dudes just shaking the p*ss from their d*cks all over us and calling it rain. Oh, it worked out so very well, didn't it?"
This is going to further drive a greater wedge in the wealth gap and create a recession which will put more money in the rorbber baron’s pockets.   This guy has the morality of a slaver
"How about, instead of buying all that crap we buy from China, with their cheap labor, we built those factories in Central America! We still get the same cheap crap, but now it’s not shipped as far, Central America now has employment for their citizens, so they don’t have to migrant to the US!"
"We need good relationships with our allies, which Trump has a problem with …"
We spent the last 4 years listening to the democrats and media tell us that higher cost creates a thriving economy. Funny how things flipflop when they are no longer in control.

"Robert Lighthizer is clearly educated beyond his intelligence.  Unfortunately, Trump disregards all the Nobel encomiasts' warnings that tariffs will hurt our economy. ignores all credible economists warning that tariffs will hurt US economy."
This guy makes no sense. No wonder Trump doesn’t understand what he is talking about.
13:17 only a Sith deals in absolutes
"Tariff's not goint to solve all the problems, not 10-25-50- or even 100% anyway. Maybe 300-500%... things like clothes and building materials, are still cheaper when manufactured outside America even at 100% tariff. Especially when the goods has labor cost is higher than the raw material cost. When an good that is sold at $100, where the labor is at $30, and material at $20, with $50 profit, but if you give it a 100% tax, it's now selling at $200 dollars, allowing you to take (in theory) $100 for every $30 paid to labor (in China or India) and for every $50 the manufacture profits... but still it's NOT going to bring those jobs back to United States, because the labor cost in USA would be at $150 to $300 just to make a $200-product, and the profitabiliy of something sold at $200 minus the labor $150 and material $20, would only be $30 profit, at 15% ($30/$200) profitability, it's not going to attract any business to move its base back into United States... 

Meanwhile, people who used to be able to buy stuff at $100, now would have to buy it at $200, or even at $300 for products made in USA... it would have a short-term pain for the average households, and a long term drop in trade. People who sells stuff at $100 to the United States, would now look for customers outside of United States selling at $100 to make up for the loss of revenue.

In the end, average consumers would either find cheaper tag price items at $50 for much inferior quality, or people could end-up buying from a trip to Mexico or Canada to buy item at 50% discount and bring them in as 'personal comsumption' to evade the import tax. If tariff is at 100%, demand for higher priced item would drop by 50%, and those who couldn't afford, would help jack up the price of much inferior item. Say if you used to buy natural cotton t-shirt at $20 a piece, which gives manufacture $10 for every t-shirt sold. Now it's selling at $40-dollar, and you'll end up buying a $20-dollar chemically-synthesized-fabric at cost of $2 where manufacturer would make $8 for every t-shirt sold, and the US government would take $10-dollar, allowing you to keep your cost down at $20 for t-shirt. the downside for you is that chemically-synthesized t-shirt would contain unhealthy substances and put a strain on US-health system, thereby increasing the insurance cost even further.

I'm not sure where the $10 dollar tax by government would go for every chemically-synthesized t-shirt sold at $20, but it's definitely not in the pockets of average consumers or health insurance of tax payers."
Biggest decline in manufacturing occurred under Reagan and Bush in past 50 years. Wasn’t MAGA Reagan’s slogan? Hope we do better. Looks like we are off to a terrible start.
"We need to care for nature, our land, our people. Every nation must do this. CEOs too often care for profits alone. They leave their neighbor out on the road in need. Starbucks wint even let you use their bathroom anymore. How is that caring for community? 

Other countries don’t do this. They care about their people, & they make better deals because they demand it. They love their people more. American companies must learn to love their employees & communities more. CEOs aren't being taken advantage of, they are taking advantage & worshiping profits & greed. 

Glad this employer will go back into business & keep the community employed. Every country must look out for its people, not just its CEOs. 

The difference now than a few decades ago is too many CEOs care about raking in money, more than keeping good people employed. It is noble to take less money & have less profits if the money is going into communities. In the past, most CEOs did not care so much about money & profits & more about people & keeping a standard of living."
"Dont blame other, you and your US companies want the highest profit...your pension plan depend on it, your USD depend on it. Sound more like you want your cake and eat it too.  Sorry if you to blind to see it 2025 is not 1980.... Usa cant dictate on a whimp."

‌- Expand diversified markets: Actively explore other markets besides the United States, such as Europe and Southeast Asia, to reduce dependence on the US market.
‌- Strengthen international cooperation: Actively participate in the construction and reform of international trade organizations and multilateral trading systems, and promote the liberalization and facilitation of global trade and investment.
‌- Optimize industrial structure: Accelerate the adjustment and transformation and upgrading of industrial structure, and promote high-quality economic development. Reduce dependence on traditional export industries by developing emerging industries such as high-end manufacturing and service industries."
"If the prize from china is high, we buy from american goods produce in america!"
"I’m amazed of how stupid Trump is. No longer is the US the only country with resources and best yet, the people are the biggest resource.  The US has genius in the country, but the blue collar workforce is lazy and not able to produce at the same rate as others around the world. The US feels entitled to be the best without the best resource, people. I work for a global company and there is no comparison for plants in MX, Brazil, India and China.  These companies have also built plants, supply chain and other resources where now they can bypass the US very easy, I know because I work for a such company in the automotive industry. These plants are out producing the US by millions and millions of dollars. Whose fault is this?  This is AMERICAN greed? Maybe not? Look at the average American who voted for Trump, these people could not go toe for toe with the rest of the world. So this is why American companies go to the rest of the world and yes it’s a third of the price to produce and sometimes less. I love the US, and I believe we all need each other and when you have dialogue you come up with great ideas and solutions. Not by trying to bully others. The American people will be the ones suffering the consequences."

The tariffs are going to hurt small business mostly Republicans which rely on imports more than the large companies who can absorb the costs which will transfer more wealth to them and increase their control over sectors of the economy. It's the gilded age 2.0 being implemented by DOGEs 20225 plan.

By 2028 Republicans will still blame China, Immigrants and the Democrats (with many many billions if not trillions in their pockets) the end. (Hey, but MAGA, right? )"

As an outsider(not American); it is frightening how America is killing itself and doesn't see it.
Loose lips sinks ships
"Tarrifs have a back-end benefit that is not mentioned here.  Tarrifs make American made products less expensive, realitive to an import. So, yes, a person might pay more at Walmart for a product.  But the theory is that the person who pays more at Walmart will pay lower taxes because his next-door neighbor now has a job making the thing he buys at Walmart.  His neighbor now has a job that was formerly in China, and he pays taxes, so the rest of us pay lower taxes."
60 minutes is the wors lying organisation in the world.

"Simple! 🇺🇸 is not competitive, and resources move to areas where they can be used in the most efficient and effective ways to generate wealth. So  🇺🇸 needs to become competitive as its spending power is declining due to other countries having a competitive advantage in certain sectors.  As the rest of the  per capita  income increases  🇺🇸 will become increasingly irrelevant as a leading market for products and so tariffs will not work. The  through globalisation is more integrated than before. No country produces all the raw materials required for its industries. Hence, there must be collaboration. The America first policy is doomed to fail. 🇺🇸 problems can only be solved through creativity, innovation , trade, and collaboration. Capitalism, as well as neo political culturalism, must be reviewed to be relevant for this century. If that is not done, then it will continue to lead to more frustration, disillusionment, conflict, and the coming into power of despots who are incapable of stemming the tide. The  is in transition, and  how we facilitate this transition will determine our survival. We all need to play our part for our prosperity and, ultimately, our survival."

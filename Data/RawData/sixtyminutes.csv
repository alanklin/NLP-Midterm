Lost manufacturing jobs in the U.S. are not due to the conduct of other countries. It is because the American companies decided to look for cheap labore in other countries. So, it was the greed of the American companies that created the problem. Thus, blaming other countries for the greed of the American companies is simply absurd and counterproductive.

You can't gut the American people in education, increasing cost of living, healthcare, housing, higher education, giving advantages to corporations and lobbyists that are always at the expense of the people and expect us to remain a leading power when our greatest resource - the people, are struggling. We have no one to blame but ourselves.

Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..

Highly paid CEOs will have to figure out how to make a profit? Yes, by cutting jobs. Labor is the biggest source of spending for a company. And these highly paid CEOs need to answer to shareholders and Wall Street. Higher prices mean less people will buy goods and services, leading to lower GDP, and thus leading to more unemployment. Lighthizer seems light-minded about this reality.

We should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends—weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world—all while cynically waving the American flag.”

At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for this ""strategy"" to have even a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products we buy today (or the parts that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years and a lot of private and government investment and lower cost labor (higher legal immigration) to reverse the trend that accelerated the assembly of consumer products to China and Mexico in the late 90s and early 00s.

I think we are in a temporary “snap back” period from far too many years of low interest rates, easy to get loans and the United States leading the world in devaluation of Labor. We have far too many burger joints and far too few manufacturing jobs that supply goods to the rest of the world. We will find out soon enough that Chinese and other nations can make a damn good product! Our choice is clear. Do we charge more for access to the American consumer (tariffs) and put down the burger spatula. Do we show up to work on time, sober, and off the govt. dole? Or do we increase transfer payments to favored groups and perpetuate the insanity of exporting our inflation to the rest of the world by trading “little green pieces of paper” for hard durable goods that float here from elsewhere?
This is of course my opinion and is in no way intended to support or critique any individual person or political figure.

Tariffs are a fool's errand. They will not achieve their goals, and they will punish consumers with higher prices while also ramping up inflation.
I don't care who this guy is or what his credential are, this is not the way to go if the goal is to bring jobs back to the USA.
Wasn't the original goal of the first round of tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the USA? This will result in a net loss of jobs and maybe cause a recession.

But these same conservatives in their never-ending quest to agree with everything their dear leader propsoses, will somehow tell you that companies taking on cost of tarriffs will magically ""not necessarily"" increase the cost of goods for the consumer.

In order to bring back manufacturing jobs, US needs to develop infrastructure. There is no high speed railway while China has a lot. China also develops a lot of canals to link areas to facilitate transportation of raw materials and China develops clean energy like solar panels. Without infrastructure, manufacturing will be very hard.

""Tariffs are a tax on a foreign country""

What this person fails to understand is that the capitalist system transcends individual intentions. Companies will inevitably pass the additional costs onto consumers, leading to higher prices. This can trigger inflation, which may result in reduced investment as interest rates rise in response. Overall, this is one of the least efficient ways to negotiate, as it disrupts the domestic economy of your country.

Tariffs have some similarities to sanctions in some ways, because it impacts on the society at large (cost of living, job losses, cut on government budget such as health, education, crime, defense etc).   For over two decades my country Eritrea has been under crippling US & EU sanctions because they hated the government and they wanted to achieve regime change agenda.  But the sanctions only hurt poor citizens of the country denying them basic services and as a result causing some take the extreme measures to migrate to other countries.   
The west specially the US often applied sanctions to several countries using all sorts of reason to justify the sanctions.  Countries like Cuba, Zimbabwe, Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, and many more have suffered from evil US and EU sanctions.  If unless Western powers change their foreign policy to non-interventionist policy then there will always be migrants from countries that they sanctioned, coming to their shores.   The irony is majority of Americas and Europeans don’t understand the link between migration and Western interventionist foreign policy.

This is a perfect opportunity for Canada to diversify its economy and do what BRICS nations are doing, trade in local currencies. More importantly, building an inter-provincial energy pipeline. Ontario and Quebec are hydro electric powerhouses and can leverage their exports of electricity to the US.

Presently, 87% of global trade is in U.S. dollars and the world is 400% GDP in debt, 200% of that is in U.S. dollars. Thus the reason why more and more nations are joining BRICS and trading in local currencies with the ultimate goal of moving away from the dollar reserve.

Keep in mind, the US doesn't have a manufacturing base anymore which is why they import pretty much everything from Asia and Mexico. What little they do manufacture will be affected by tarrifs, as the most efficient sources of supply will not be available because of regulations RESTRICTING importation from those sources, resulting in either second-best products or higher costs for restricted supplies. 

In other words, bringing back manufacturing to the USA is a pipe dream given the time and cost of building new factories which will be dependent on foreign parts loaded down with tarrifs!

Secondarily, any new factories would be premised on robotics, cnc and AI, doing little to create new jobs, much less alleviate unemployment.

The US oil sector is also problematic because its main oil producing states have stopped fracking due to earthquakes and damage caused to structures and foundations, resulting in class action lawsuits. 

Even Trump's recent Executive Order reveals how bad the oil and gas sectors are: ""The United States’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy. EO Jan 20, 2025

In short, the US is in a state of collapse and its income tax base can't cover the interest on its massive 36 trillion dollar debt, which is the main reason for the tarrifs.

Tariffs serve many purposes. Obviously some are positives, and some are negatives. It depends also on which side of the fence you are sitting at. 

Tariffs do buy time for the weaker, noncompetitive industries to catch up, providing some breathing space. But it should never be used as a ""fix-all"" snake oil. In fact, I would regard tariffs as ""band-aid"". It provides temporary relief, it shields the wound from sight, but it won't cure the wound. It covers up the wound to keep away the unwanted elements such as bacteria and dust, but that is all. 

The US industries are overly dependent on tariffs for their survival. Politicians who come and go at a regular 4 year interval, are dying for votes to get in the White House. So buying votes is not beyond them, and tariffs is just the perfect tool to do that. What the politicians are doing is to kick the can of ""very things to do"" further down the track, for the successive administration. Biden got the can from Trump, and now Trump is holding that can, and is doing the same. Not only is Trump creating more tariffs, he is also making enemies out of allies namely Canada and Mexico. As for Chyaannah...Trump is soft peddling because he knows it does have leverage over the US, I am talking about critical minerals.

China's dominance of trade is largely due to the greed of US CEOs and shareholders squeezing maximum profit by moving manufacturing off-shore and basically giving US technology to the Chinese – who aren't stupid and take full advantage of the situation. It's not clear at all that tariff's can address the problem we have created for ourselves. We need to have incentives, regulations and above all, the educational system needed to train people for the jobs we're trying to bring back to the US. Unfortunately, regulations and investment in education seem to be very low-priority for the party in power, and tariff-mania looks to be very short-sighted and most likely ineffectual.

They are pulling out of existing relationships with the US right and left. Cancelling trips, anything that brings money to the US is subject to protest by individuals, businesses and corporations at this time. They are working to provide more of their own goods and looking for better options across the world for things they'll need to import. Canadians are rising to the challenge. Washington businesses and others that rely on Canadian dollars should prepare for upcoming major hits.

The first statement is like saying, the cost of products doesn't matter, it does.

Meaning the wealthy in America have benefited  from trade with China. Unlike in China where the poor working class benefited from trade with the U.S. If anything it's the top 1% fault why America lost so many jobs to China, they just took it when we gave it to them.

All in all, your budget Walmart and Amazon is going to be able to price them out further.

It’s virtually impossible. Capitalism mandates economic war. You win some, you lose some. Now it’s time for the U.S. to lose. The Chinese people experienced the fastest growth of its middle class in human history and they were not number one in the economy war. It certainly didn’t hurt China overall to be second while they aspired to be number one. It won’t hurt us as well as long as our government acts accordingly. Our present fascist regime will hurt us more than the economic war with China will.

Theres just no way jobs will be back to US when labor is expensive.

Therefore, defaulting has become a VERY REAL possibility for America!

But then, I am a wealthy Futures Markets day-trader, so I will be just fine! But, will ALL of your loved-ones??

What the most Americans are ignoring is the fact that the tariffs wont just hit the economy bad, it will hurt the geopolitics and diplomacy worse. If the USA can impose tariffs on Mexico and  Canada even after Free Trade agreement, well the USA can really go for anything and that will not instill much faith on other countries too. And with the latest news on imposing tariffs on UK and the EU, China is having the biggest laugh in the decades.

You can't have cake and eat it too. You can't expect other countries to be your cheap labor forever. They can learn and do the same thing. 
Now, placing tariffs on products that you no longer make will only cause inflation. Placing tariffs on products that your country makes could be useful if it does not encourage your own manufacturer to bring down quality.

The US does NOT have the manufacturing capability to provide cheaper, domestic alternatives to foreign goods. So the way tariffs used to work, IE foreign stuff is expensive so we buy local, is not the way they will work now. Because when the price goes up thanks to tariffs, you dont HAVE a cheap option to pick. You either have to pay the inflated price or do without.

He talks about semi-conductors.  Maybe it would be good to have semi-conductor manufacturing in the US, but building a fabrication plant for semi-conductors takes 3-4 years minimum, 7000 construction workers, and would cost over 10 billion dollars to build.  For one plant.  Biden made some progress on encouraging semi-conductor manufacturing in the US, but he ran into a problem - there aren't anywhere near enough people in the US who have the two-years of training needed to work at such a plant. So even if the tariffs have exactly the effect Lighthizer is looking for, it could be 5 years before semi-conductors start rolling off of the line. And of course, those semi-conductors would be much more expensive because American workers demand higher wages that Chinese workers. 

Look at t-shirts.  You can buy a six-pack of Hanes t-shirts (made elsewhere) for around $18. That's $3/shirt.  There are a bunch of companies selling made-in-the-USA t-shirts, for $15/shirt. So when Elon Musk says that tariffs will cause Americans ""temporary hardship"" due to higher prices, know that it won't be all that temporary.

Tariffs are very difficult to undo once they are done.  As has already happened, when you place tariffs on imports from a country, that country responds with tariffs on your imports. So now removing the tariffs is a trade negotiation.  Meanwhile, businesses in those other countries immediately start looking for other places to sell their goods - it's a big world. By the time tariffs are repealed, all of those suppliers we used to depend on will have moved on to more reliable and less fickle customers.

Speaking of fickle - Trump had to label these tariffs as ""emergency"" to avoid violating trade deals that TRUMP signed with Canada and Mexico less that 5 years ago. We signed the Paris Climate Agreement, Trump pulled us off of it, Biden signed us back on, and now Trump has pulled us out of it again.  How long before countries stop trusting the United States as a reliable partner? If someone welches on all of their bets, how long to keep inviting them to your poker night?

I’m concerned as I would be with any large change. I’m going to hold off on drawing any conclusions until I see what happens. 

The US could end up with higher inflation and higher  interest rates as a result. However, this could also cause higher unemployment, which will bring down interest rates. I realize there are other factors at play but I’m just pointing out the area that I know. 

The only thing happening for sure is that some industries and their workers will suffer. One side says they’ll suffer for the greater good and the other says they’re the tip of the iceberg of economic doom. 

At this point we have little impact on what happens.

I really want to emphasize that we are way past the nineteenth-century; global trade is not simply importing raw materials to manufacture finished good.
We import raw materials, WIPs (works-in-progress), components, and finished goods and export eaw materials, WIPs, components, and finished goods.
There is a good article from the WSJ that covers a bathtub manufacturer in Utah, whose bathtub is made with ~1,850 parts received from seven countries and fourteen states. Some parts, like the water pump, travel through multiple countries before ending up in the Utahan factory.
We can not simply throw a tariff on a country and expect jobs to come back; we simply disrupt the entire supply chain and may be forced to purchase from another country because we do not have and never have had the production for a certain component.

EDIT: I want to clarify that I am not a free-trade shill and do think that it was a good decision to abolish NAFTA and implement the USMCA, which streamlined all trading, cut obstacles for small goods, and recognized the digital and environmental changes of the 21st century.
These new tariffs throw all that away.

The loss of American manufacturing has led to a significant increase in the income disparity between those with and without college degrees. Carefully structured, targeted tariffs on particular goods could incentivize companies to increase manufacturing capacity in the USA which would create more manufacturing jobs but not as many jobs as people think. Companies would still try to keep costs down by reducing the number of staff hours required to operate factories. AI did not exist 70 years ago during the American manufacturing boom. AI will allow factories to be much more automated than they have ever been. This means they won't actually create that many more jobs for people who don't have college degrees. You'll still need a post-secondary degree or higher to work in an automated factory. Tariffs are inflationary. They are literally designed to discourage the consumption of foreign made goods by making it harder for the companies importing them to compete with American made goods.

A bold trade policy should shock the system with immediate, high tariffs on key imports, creating a surge in tax revenue while gradually influencing inflation. By rapidly increasing tariffs, the government can generate significant funds to help balance the budget and reinvest in domestic industry, while businesses and consumers gradually adapt. This approach forces a shift toward local production, amplifying the multiplier effect as money stays within the economy, cycling through wages, reinvestment, and growth. While import prices will rise, inflationary impact will be delayed and manageable, giving time to develop domestic supply chains and strengthen industrial capacity. A high-tariff shock jumpstarts economic self-sufficiency, accelerates trade balance correction, and forces long-overdue market adjustments, positioning the nation for long-term stability and growth.

Like many have said, we're starting with hurting the closest relationship with our allies and that's not a viable long term strategy. I want America to thrive so badly once more but this seems like too blunt a tool and too short term in scope. Especially dealing with a rival like China.

What people are not understanding is that those countries have a one way advantage in trading when it should be and equal trade.  China, Mexico and Canada cannot sell their goods to their own citizens and make the same profits they make selling those goods to the USA.   Therefore those countries need the USA more than the USA needs them.  The closing statement is the best argument anyone can ever make... the current way has been failing for decades if something new isn't tried than we will continue to fail economically.

The one thing he is forgetting is over the last 50 years Americans have become lazy round and incompetent. In today's day if it says made in the USA it's more than likely a crappy product because the company is maximizing profit over quality. Like teslas rc cars, they don't care how bad it is as long as they can take your money.

As an engineer I'm taking my knowledge and my money and going elsewhere. Going to a country who wants to work with other countries who wants the human race to succeed and cares about their citizens. The ones who are going to be left in this country will not have the skill set to build anything. The only thing that this is going to do is make the rich richer while the rest of us pay extra for basic needs.

I wish the mericants the best of luck, but being this naive ALWAYS ends horribly.

tariffs are supposed to be a temporary cost for a long term benefit. The idea that tariffs will bolster domestic industry and production and lead american consumers to buy domestic goods would be valid if WE ACTUALLY HAD DOMESTIC INDUSTRY, these companies have allready outsourced the vast majority of production and labor to foreign countries so in the end all this is going to do is lead americans to pay more for things they have to buy from foreign producers , because there are no american producers that produce them. domestic products will also go up as companies only care about profits, not empowering the american worker.  corporations got us into this muck by outsorucing everything, and we were complicit in it when we fell in love with cheap foreign goods and continued to consume with no thought or foresight into how this would lead to a long term decimation of the american economy

TWO big problems here.  1. Trump isn't talking about just targeting China or only applying limited tariffs on a specific sector that needs protected from foreign dumping.  He is talking about universal tariffs on all imports, even from our allies and countries that we have tried to boost economically as part of stopping illegal immigration.  2. It sickens me to hear this man who won't feel a bit of pain in his personal life from the disruption and high prices many of us will struggle with if he gets his way just shrug off the harm this will do to so many by saying we could just switch back in a decade if it doesn't work.

I suggest people read up on the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the early 20th century that led to the Great Depression. If he follows through on his plans, we could be looking at something very similar.

It's not that I completely disagree with the idea of relying less on China to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  But placing tariffs on ALL imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  INSTEAD of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from North, Central, and South America, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a US company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the U.S.  It would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  It would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the U.S. for work.    It would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the Panama Canal, because U.S. and Canadian imports from Mexico, C.A. and S.A. could come by train.  But Trump is the President now, so I guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve OUR (not just HIS) goals.  It would also ensure that those Central and S. American countries stay aligned with us instead of becoming more entwined with China.  Right now, it seems like Trump is pushing countries AWAY from us and TOWARDS closer economic and political ties with China

Isn’t it interesting that we have enabled China by shipping our manufacturing jobs and now we want them back. Policies matter a lot, because their impact is felt after 10 or 20 years later. Outsourcing helps companies quarterly or annual returns look good, ie stock price goes up, but they destroy middle class and the ability to compete and leads to trade deficits. We should focus on ‘making’ things in USA, rather than ‘manufacturing’ financial results

If all we want to look at is cheaper goods, then why are we making anything here? There is no way a US manufacturer can compete with a Chinese or Mexican Manufacturer, it just can't. Labor costs are so much cheaper in those other countries. We need to stop always thinking cheaper and start thinking about the men and women who are losing their jobs. When jobs loses happen, what do we think these people are supposed to do to survive? First they will need assistance, that could be longer term. Then they stop spending because they don't have the extra money to spend. So tax money goes to help the people who have been laid off, plus the taxes those people were paying is gone. I can also assume some of those laid off can go through depression and other issues. Perhaps turning to drugs or alcohol to get through the day. Again that costs more taxes for rehab and also deaths. We have no choice but to stop thinking cheaper all the time and think about a neighbors and follow Americans.

What they aren't factoring in is the cost to transport goods from overseas. I thought we cared about the environment? Why are we shipping basic goods from China that can be produced here? We also have a lot of red tape to build factories which should be improved with deregulation. Start up costs have to be improved. Then you have to factor in economies of scale. Prices would improve over time. Wages then increase over time. Once production in the US ramps up, we now how an eco friendly and competitive product, wages are higher, it's American made, quality products return and they could be cheaper in the long run via automation and economies of scale, with lesd transport costs. Depending on the product, this ramp up of production could happen relatively quickly.

I’m amazed of how stupid Trump is. No longer is the US the only country with resources and best yet, the people are the biggest resource.  The US has genius in the country, but the blue collar workforce is lazy and not able to produce at the same rate as others around the world. The US feels entitled to be the best without the best resource, people. I work for a global company and there is no comparison for plants in MX, Brazil, India and China.  These companies have also built plants, supply chain and other resources where now they can bypass the US very easy, I know because I work for a such company in the automotive industry. These plants are out producing the US by millions and millions of dollars. Whose fault is this?  This is AMERICAN greed? Maybe not? Look at the average American who voted for Trump, these people could not go toe for toe with the rest of the world. So this is why American companies go to the rest of the world and yes it’s a third of the price to produce and sometimes less. I love the US, and I believe we all need each other and when you have dialogue you come up with great ideas and solutions. Not by trying to bully others. The American people will be the ones suffering the consequences.

If USA wants to attack China together with its allies by increasing tariffs on Chinese good, maybe it's not the best idea to FIRST implement tariffs on the goods produced by the said allies. Also his idea of how to achieve the world peace is very frightening one. As far as the tariffs themselves are concerned, from the point of regular Americans they will be like peeing in your pants in a freezing temperature - first it warms you up, but then it gets really cold.

Maybe stop looking at economics as a competition and realize that if you reach an equilibrium where China’s labor force no longer is a cheaper alternative then things balance out. Capitalist businesses will always seek to use the cheapest labor. As nations mature their labor force becomes more expensive. It’s the cycle. Eventually manufacturing will find its way to Africa and so on. The key is to keep evolving your workforce to meet different needs.

How many CEOs care about workers? They care about profits first, then everything else, or they aren’t capitalists. If profits are squeezed, they look for ways to cut costs,,  mostly automate, use lower priced materials, or lower wages. Automation may create some jobs, but most likely which don’t involve the skill set of those laid off.  Unless profits no longer matter, tariffs won’t benefit very many Americans. Those laid off will need to change locations, or carriers, or both.

We need to care for nature, our land, our people. Every nation must do this. CEOs too often care for profits alone. They leave their neighbor out on the road in need. Starbucks wint even let you use their bathroom anymore. How is that caring for community? 

Other countries don’t do this. They care about their people, & they make better deals because they demand it. They love their people more. American companies must learn to love their employees & communities more. CEOs aren't being taken advantage of, they are taking advantage & worshiping profits & greed. 

Glad this employer will go back into business & keep the community employed. Every country must look out for its people, not just its CEOs. 

The difference now than a few decades ago is too many CEOs care about raking in money, more than keeping good people employed. It is noble to take less money & have less profits if the money is going into communities. In the past, most CEOs did not care so much about money & profits & more about people & keeping a standard of living.

Wait. What? American CEOs are going to have to figure out how to cover the cost of tariffs? But their whole thing--schlump and his cronies--is that Mexico, Canada and China will bear those costs. So, which is it Bob? Interesting that he was appointed by Reagan. We all know how Reagan's economic policy worked out for the middle class. Oh, it used to be that the average American family used to have at least one full-time employee in their family and even though there was just one main earner, most of those families could afford to pay their mortgages, buy school supplies and groceries, and buy the occasional car and take the occasional family vacation without having to sacrifice any regular stuff like medicine (they had health care back then). It was called the Middle Class. It was a pretty nifty thing for families until Ronald Reagan, yes, the actor, and, probably this buffoon here, Lighthizer, ideated that wealthy corporate owners could be given huge tax breaks to ""invest in their employees and business infrastructure"" and then pass the new financial windfalls they'd get and eventually got, down too the dedicated men and women who had those great, secure jobs that kept them in the Middle Class. They called it ""trickle down economics. It was sold as manna from heaven for the regular worker and family but turned out to be a bunch of wealthy dudes just shaking the p*ss from their d*cks all over us and calling it rain. Oh, it worked out so very well, didn't it?

Tariff's not goint to solve all the problems, not 10-25-50- or even 100% anyway. Maybe 300-500%... things like clothes and building materials, are still cheaper when manufactured outside America even at 100% tariff. Especially when the goods has labor cost is higher than the raw material cost. When an good that is sold at $100, where the labor is at $30, and material at $20, with $50 profit, but if you give it a 100% tax, it's now selling at $200 dollars, allowing you to take (in theory) $100 for every $30 paid to labor (in China or India) and for every $50 the manufacture profits... but still it's NOT going to bring those jobs back to United States, because the labor cost in USA would be at $150 to $300 just to make a $200-product, and the profitabiliy of something sold at $200 minus the labor $150 and material $20, would only be $30 profit, at 15% ($30/$200) profitability, it's not going to attract any business to move its base back into United States... 

Meanwhile, people who used to be able to buy stuff at $100, now would have to buy it at $200, or even at $300 for products made in USA... it would have a short-term pain for the average households, and a long term drop in trade. People who sells stuff at $100 to the United States, would now look for customers outside of United States selling at $100 to make up for the loss of revenue.

In the end, average consumers would either find cheaper tag price items at $50 for much inferior quality, or people could end-up buying from a trip to Mexico or Canada to buy item at 50% discount and bring them in as 'personal comsumption' to evade the import tax. If tariff is at 100%, demand for higher priced item would drop by 50%, and those who couldn't afford, would help jack up the price of much inferior item. Say if you used to buy natural cotton t-shirt at $20 a piece, which gives manufacture $10 for every t-shirt sold. Now it's selling at $40-dollar, and you'll end up buying a $20-dollar chemically-synthesized-fabric at cost of $2 where manufacturer would make $8 for every t-shirt sold, and the US government would take $10-dollar, allowing you to keep your cost down at $20 for t-shirt. the downside for you is that chemically-synthesized t-shirt would contain unhealthy substances and put a strain on US-health system, thereby increasing the insurance cost even further.

I'm not sure where the $10 dollar tax by government would go for every chemically-synthesized t-shirt sold at $20, but it's definitely not in the pockets of average consumers or health insurance of tax payers.

With that size, China is naturally a heavy weight, made that way with the help of western investments.  The West just did a lousy math job calculating that China would not surpass the West, hence the panic!
The million dollar question: can the country educate its work force and have an environment conducive towards more local investments and a bigger workforce?
Japan and other asian countries got ahead because their workforce had the skills to make good, affordable products!  Clear example of that is Taiwan, where TSMC make high end chips with western technology,  Their workers have something US workers can not provide.  Even well established US companies like Boeing are having trouble finding skilled workers!

This gay did finish the statement. When a CEO looks at last quarter earnings and see that there was lost “year-over-year” they are then looking at by the board members and stockholders; how are we going to get our money to profit. If the quarterly profit doesn’t go up then they will find another CEO that is willing to do what it takes to make a profit. That is where the workers will lose their job when the job goes to Mexico or Canada. The bottom line is the company MUST make a profit so the workers can get paid.

I don't see how this goes well or becomes a good thing without that starting to happen and becoming law in 2025 at the latest. Republicans can easily gain democratic votes and support on this issue and in general if their economic protection regime was a properly implemented patriotic program. Same with the birthing stuff. Ok, you want babies, actually deliver on the state sponsored pro-natal programs that they like to go on about.

The tariffs are going to hurt small business mostly Republicans which rely on imports more than the large companies who can absorb the costs which will transfer more wealth to them and increase their control over sectors of the economy. It's the gilded age 2.0 being implemented by DOGEs 20225 plan.

Comment number one tariffs are a tax on the people and there is no doubt about that. Comment number two on the initial point of the trade difference and deficit between us and China. How do we expect that to go down when China because of us and our greed in the late '70s early '80s decided to give them the title of world production factory. We did this because they offered to build anything we want for cheaper price and of course the geniuses very unpatriotic business owners said yeah sure let's go there We can make more money. So we did So how on earth do we expect to not produce much they produce everything and to have some kind of balance between trade. The only reason that there is even that one to three whatever it's called difference is because of negotiations in agreements to force them to buy a certain amount from us. Truthfully if that agreement was not there they wouldn't buy a damn thing from us because they can make it and they can also make it for less money like they do for the rest of the world.

Here is the math: “I am the second coming!” People believed and voted. New God feels invincible. God destroys to rebuild. People realize their God is not invincible and will make everyone suffer (except his wealthy friends and family) soon companies will have to let go of many employees to be able to stay in business. Many laborers will be forced into encampments or be deported. Those legally able to work will not work for cheap wages. No jobs, no employees will result in a dominoes effect. By 2028 Republicans will still blame China, Immigrants and the Democrats (with many many billions if not trillions in their pockets) the end. (Hey, but MAGA, right? )

Tarrifs have a back-end benefit that is not mentioned here.  Tarrifs make American made products less expensive, realitive to an import. So, yes, a person might pay more at Walmart for a product.  But the theory is that the person who pays more at Walmart will pay lower taxes because his next-door neighbor now has a job making the thing he buys at Walmart.  His neighbor now has a job that was formerly in China, and he pays taxes, so the rest of us pay lower taxes.

Simple! 🇺🇸 is not competitive, and resources move to areas where they can be used in the most efficient and effective ways to generate wealth. So  🇺🇸 needs to become competitive as its spending power is declining due to other countries having a competitive advantage in certain sectors.  As the rest of the  per capita  income increases  🇺🇸 will become increasingly irrelevant as a leading market for products and so tariffs will not work. The  through globalisation is more integrated than before. No country produces all the raw materials required for its industries. Hence, there must be collaboration. The America first policy is doomed to fail. 🇺🇸 problems can only be solved through creativity, innovation , trade, and collaboration. Capitalism, as well as neo political culturalism, must be reviewed to be relevant for this century. If that is not done, then it will continue to lead to more frustration, disillusionment, conflict, and the coming into power of despots who are incapable of stemming the tide. The  is in transition, and  how we facilitate this transition will determine our survival. We all need to play our part for our prosperity and, ultimately, our survival.

"Lost manufacturing jobs in the U.S. are not due to the conduct of other countries. It is because the American companies decided to look for cheap labore in other countries. So, it was the greed of the American companies that created the problem. Thus, blaming other countries for the greed of the American companies is simply absurd and counterproductive."
"People who are recession-proof saying, ""Well, if this fails, we can always go back,"" make me sick. The average, middle class person who loses their home to foreclosure can't just go back."
Could we at least stop pretending that this has anything to do with fentanyl?
Tariffs are similar to raising taxes on everyone. And he intends to reduce taxes for the wealthy. Well done.
I’m no economist but I believe this will backfire. We don’t have the leverage we once had and we are pushing our allies away
This guy really gives it away when he says the very well paid CEOs are gonna just have to figure it out. Yeah. They’re going to figure it out the way they always do. They are not going to cut their own pay and they are going to raise prices.
"“If in TEN years it doesn’t work, I guess we’ll go back to what we’ve done in the past” — that’s a wild statement "
"""America First"" = ""America Alone""    What a dark joke."
when Trump is done and the next president removes these bogus tariffs.... we will have a different problem. companies wont wont to drop their prices because they will feel that customers are used to paying more. and they will want to keep profits high. so... yeah. everything will be more expensive from here on out.
"This is where Trump is getting his advice on the economy. After listening to this guy, I am not impressed."
The poor and middle class always paying the price & suffering the consequences of these greedy dictators. I’m sick of them.
"With Trump's re-elected, both US stocks and Bitcoin are seeing strong gains. I'm eyeing the potential for more market volatility, but Bitcoin's all-time high is interesting. With inflation and interest rates on the rise, I'm wondering if this is a good time to dive deeper into stocks or focus on crypto for diversification. Any thoughts on balancing both?"
"What a clown.  If it doesn't work, we'll go back. What about the lost reputation? What about the hate to USA? Nobody wants a bully partner. Sick man"
His answer at the end was basically “oh well”.  That’s the problem when you have people who haven’t stepped in a grocery store in years making policies that affect regular folks
"Tax cuts for the rich, tax increases for the lower and middle class.  Tariffs will make everything more expensive for consumers too, and prices will go up even higher."
The middle class can not afford to fail for 10 years before someone acts responsibly. Homes and livelihood would have gone.
Most Americans don't have 10 years to test if the tariffs work.
"No one talks about how these tariffs destroy the small businesses who aren't big enough to stalk pile on the front end like Walmart and other large, monopolistic corporations. Another power grab."
Robert Lightthizer ignores the biggest incentive to move American jobs out of the United States. It began with Ronald Reagan's tax code changes that gave companies incentives to move manufacturing to other countries. Look it up!
No one needs to wonder what might happen because we have history with Trump‘s first term tariffs.. steel prices increased 30% and now eight years later US steel manufacturing has not increased..
This guy is more trump than trump himself
Why are they blaming other countries and not our politicians?
It’s really an easy formula. If you wanna make our lives better make the billionaires pay their fair share.
"“Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,” said the man who declared bankruptcy six times."
European here… suddenly China looks like a better trading partner than the US.
"Remember, folks. This guy's boss bankrupted not one, but THREE, Atlantic City casinos, PLUS all the contractors who built them. "
"It's NOT ""America First"". It's ""Corporate America and stockholders first""."
"I know this guy is supposed to be the expert, but his ideas sound very antiquated to me. Being the biggest, baddest bully on the block doesn't work when the ""adversary"" has a high intellect and is outsmarting us on several fronts. You can't gut the American people in education, increasing cost of living, healthcare, housing, higher education, giving advantages to corporations and lobbyists that are always at the expense of the people and expect us to remain a leading power when our greatest resource - the people, are struggling. We have no one to blame but ourselves."
We have a president trying to play chess with the skills of someone who can barely play checkers.
"He says it so nonchalantly, if it doesn’t work in 10 years we just go back? Regular people are living paycheck to paycheck. They can barely meet their need expenses and what are they supposed to do in 10 years? Go into debt? I hope Americans are prepared for a real recession, if they think we already in one, they are going to feel it like a depression. When Rich dudes are selling their stocks it means is time to"
How on earth can 60 Minutes do an entire segment on tariffs without mentioning wage disparity between the U.S. and countries like China and Mexico?
Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..
"Highly paid CEOs will have to figure out how to make a profit? Yes, by cutting jobs. Labor is the biggest source of spending for a company. And these highly paid CEOs need to answer to shareholders and Wall Street. Higher prices mean less people will buy goods and services, leading to lower GDP, and thus leading to more unemployment. Lighthizer seems light-minded about this reality."
'The genius of American and our allies can turn this around'. Let's start by putting tariffs on our allies. Madness.
So as a 40-year Republican we traditionally strived for zero tariffs.. this is not Republican and is batshit crazy.
"USA, USA, USA, now, Canada needs to deal with its fentanyl problem at the border and  across the border, It is a serious issue that requires urgent action…"
"So let me get this straight.  You want more entrepeneurship.  But you don't want to provide education, you don't want to provide free heathlcare, you don't want to give time off to start companies like Scandinavia and other countries do, you don't want to provide affordable clean energy with solar and wind. You don't want to provide affordable transportation.  You don't want affordable shipping. You don't even want free K-12.  You don't want social security.  And this is your plan to bring back entrepreneurship in America? LOL!"
"If the US wants to get serious about trade then go talk to Wall St to get them to believe in reduced corporate profits since the US economy is based primarily on consumption, not production."
Tariffs are added taxes to us. Not some magic money going into his fantasy export department
"Translation : 
Nothing new,  The rich get richer , the middle-class & the poor get poorer"
"If you increase prices, you contract the economy. People on fixed or low incomes buy less. Asset prices will fall, and the Billionaires will buy everything because they are cash-rich. Disaster capitalism 101"
Guy has no training in economics. He's a lawyer...
"So he admitted it had nothing to do with fentanyl…it’s all economic. How about we just blame ourselves for decades of not building our manufacturing, etc."
"""Will these highly paid CEOs figure it out"" lets look at that wealth gap. Yup, theyll figure it out by raising prices. This guy is a snake oil salesman"
Last phrase he said: If it doesn’t work… ooops  These are the advisers? What a joke!
Tariffs are similar to raising taxes for everyone. And he is planning to reduce taxes for the riches. Well done.
"Funny he say ""Allies"" 06:20. When we fire at our closest ""Allies"" by hitting them with 25% tariff. I don't think we are going to find much countries willing to cooperate with US."
I was advised to diversify my portfolio among several assets such as stocks and bonds since this can protect my portfolio for retirement. I'm seeking to invest $250K across markets but don't know where to start.
"In light of what he's saying, why do they let the Chinese buy US real estate and US companies?"
"Good luck, USA. You’re gonna need it."
The economist have already said that it will be a disaster if Trump becomes president. I think he’s going to prove the economist right
"Robert's answer to the tariffs create layoffs question was such a typical ""I'm wealthy, I think it'll be fine"" answer."
so why 10% on China but 25% on Canada who is the strongest ally (or used to be) to the US.
"what the guy is saying made sense - 40 years ago.  When Reagan allowed corporations to send jobs overseas ( ""offshoring "" )  THAT was the time for tariffs to punish the companies that send jobs overseas and protect our existing manufacturing base.  Tariffs are NOT the solution now."
Tariffs = Cost passed onto Consumer = Higher Inflation = Higher Interest Rates
Only a day later and this video already hasn’t aged well
"Tariffs only affect poor people. Rich people don’t notice the increase in costs.
A poor person tax."
"While the poor get poorer, the rich get richer."
From Australia over here it seems to me we are better off to start trading with the B.R.I.C.S nations. The US has lost the plot.
What makes the US think that other countries need them? Turning point will be when other countries realize that they are able to survive without trading with the US.
"When you enter Canada you enter through Canada's border and customs officers. When you enter the USA from Canada you enter through the USAs border and customs officers,  so who's letting it in?"
What Lighthizer fails to mention is that so many of those products that used to be in the US are made in China now because the American companies ORDERED THEM from Chinese factories. US companies helped to create the very situation we find ourselves in.
Looks like the Great Depression will be repeated…
"""If we do this in 10 years it doesn't work we can go back and always fail again the way we have in the past."" "
they grossly underestimate the greed of CEOs
"In Brazil, a Shark vacuum cleaner that costs $148 here costs $2,048 there! This is how Brazilians live—everything is more expensive due to the high tariffs. I never imagined seeing this happen here in the U.S. After decades living here, it is sad to say that Republicans will transform the US in something ugly."
America is a toddler fiddling with a firearm.
"As someone who graduated in the early 2000’s under tons of false promises about this workforce. I’m sickened!!!!!
Im working 2 jobs to make the same money I should be making working one job!!!
What we’ve put our citizens through through endless war in the Middle East, to a devastating amount of illegal immigration, to selling off technology and jobs to other countries. This country has done no favors for itself and its people in the last 30 years"
Fetenayl isn't the problem its Trump.
How long until this economy collapses? Average family is already stretched thin.
"but you imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Also, you fostered the rise of China, as the US sent all its manufacturing to China- to make Billions more and use cheap labour."
I thought the interviewer wasn't supposed to be biased.
"President Reagan's 1988 radio address on free trade, delivered soon after the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement was signed, remains timely: “Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends—weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world—all while cynically waving the American flag.”"
Trump will tell his people what they want to hear. He Always has and they fall for it.
Never  underestimate the power of magical thinking.
"At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for this ""strategy"" to have even a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products we buy today (or the parts that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years and a lot of private and government investment and lower cost labor (higher legal immigration) to reverse the trend that accelerated the assembly of consumer products to China and Mexico in the late 90s and early 00s."
"Who is this guy kidding?  ""CEO's have to figure out a way to make a profit"".  Yeah, by cutting costs and raising prices."
"Trump on campaign - I will lower prices.    
Trump 7 days after taking office - Raises prices."
"13:20 My man's never heard of a false dichotomy.... 

Imagine investing in education and health care. Imagine preparing workers for the workforce. Imagine breaking up big banks, imagine cracking down on monopoly power, imagine all the other ways to spur domestic labor, production, and growth..."
"if those three people voted for trump, i have ZERO sympathy!

sorry"
GOP used to be free market capitalists and all about small government. Tariffs and market manipulation are exactly the opposite.
"10:36 this fool is not backing his claims with evidence or study, but his “educated guess”. And he is advising Trump. Of course it will be Brandons fault"
No more tequila it’s back to moonshine 
High tier workers and share holders will have to forgo some of their wealth to better support the working class. That’s a good thing.
"as a truck driver, the road ahead is bumpy, courtesy of low to no freight coming in and going out to China, Canada and Mexico."
This is 100% Trump's achilles heel.  You can't have low prices (his campaign promise) and tariffs.  Pick one or the other.
"""...combined with our allies...."" not gonna have many of those for long..."
"We are sitting in Europe right now - this is one of the absolute dumbest things we can do as a country. Trust me, plenty of other countries are lined up to take the place of Americans who have checked out. Checked out on their kids’ education, checked out to let young adults play Call of Duty from the basement, checked out to fight each other instead of keeping our eye on the ball. It’s a strategic and tactical error that will cost not only us but our kids for years to come. This is isolationist insanity"
Bet ya he owns a lot of shares in a company that stands to profit big from the tariffs!
Manufacturing isn't returning to America with those workers.  Automation abd robots will be cheaper than them.
"Lighthizer said that if it doesn't work in 10 years we can go back to the other way.
That does not seem very reassuring to me. Hang on to your money as there could be an economic downturn."
"I think we are in a temporary “snap back” period from far too many years of low interest rates, easy to get loans and the United States leading the world in devaluation of Labor. We have far too many burger joints and far too few manufacturing jobs that supply goods to the rest of the world. We will find out soon enough that Chinese and other nations can make a damn good product! Our choice is clear. Do we charge more for access to the American consumer (tariffs) and put down the burger spatula. Do we show up to work on time, sober, and off the govt. dole? Or do we increase transfer payments to favored groups and perpetuate the insanity of exporting our inflation to the rest of the world by trading “little green pieces of paper” for hard durable goods that float here from elsewhere?
This is of course my opinion and is in no way intended to support or critique any individual person or political figure."
Even domestically made products will go up because they will align their prices with the foreign made goods.
Tariffs = high prices.
"Tariffs are a fool's errand. They will not achieve their goals, and they will punish consumers with higher prices while also ramping up inflation.
I don't care who this guy is or what his credential are, this is not the way to go if the goal is to bring jobs back to the USA.
Wasn't the original goal of the first round of tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the USA? This will result in a net loss of jobs and maybe cause a recession."
"I would love for some explanation how come the US can sustain a  near trillion  dollar trade deficit with China , Canada and  Mexico annually."
"What's fascinating to me is that conservatives have opposed minimum wage (let alone increases in minimum wage) since the beginning of time, saying that there is simply no way around that causing an increase in the consumer goods we all pay for... its inflationary. 

But these same conservatives in their never-ending quest to agree with everything their dear leader propsoses, will somehow tell you that companies taking on cost of tarriffs will magically ""not necessarily"" increase the cost of goods for the consumer. 

WHICH IS IT?"
One word collapse.
why are we starting a trade war with canada?  Trump says cause of drugs at the border?  Lmao what?
"I live in Europe, people are starting to talk about boycott US products. 
I’m sorry fellow americans, this is not against you, it’s against Trump administration.
I dont know where this path is going to take us, but it’s not good for both sides…"
Didnt this tariff war crap lead to the great depression? He forgets the lessons of the past...I'm referring to the Smoot-Hawley act of 1930...
"Lighthizer has forgotten how interdependent the two economies are and who can stomach more pain. Smartphones, PCs and electronic gadgets are made in the PRC. The USA offers some services but manufactures very little. Manufacturing smartphones, IC chips and batteries in the USA is no cakewalk."
"Wow you gave this guy airtime. Robert Lighthizer has to figure it out! Or get the F out. Study the history, tariff wars are not how you solve the problems that have built up over the years. Such BS. Bully tactic don't work. ""Art of the deal"" or ""art of our demise"""
2 minutes in and this guy sounds crazy!
"In order to bring back manufacturing jobs, US needs to develop infrastructure. There is no high speed railway while China has a lot. China also develops a lot of canals to link areas to facilitate transportation of raw materials and China develops clean energy like solar panels. Without infrastructure, manufacturing will be very hard."
"Did the Star Wars Prequels teach us anything?
Oh President Palpatine."
"He’s saying, more jobs and more production in America. But, who will you hire to pick your apples and potatoes when young Americans won’t do it? Who will assemble your techs when you have shortage in well-educated professionals?"
tariffs are tax on US importer. Not Foreign countries. Lol.
"I believe her, not him."
"The man gave the answer @10:53, this isn’t about bringing jobs back to America, this about using tariffs to pay for tax cuts."
"I buy from China because its prices are cheaper. That's all. That's it. If I can buy a cheaper alternative produced within my country, the heck, I'll grab it."
The market is already tanking as of this comment.   Thanks Don.
"American greed is the problem 
That's why China 🇨🇳 is more powerful every day"
The big problem is company greed! The companies doesn’t care about american jobs. Why not make a law that says that you can’t sell stuff in the USA if your company doesn’t manufacture atleast 50% of the components in the US?
"When he mentioned the word ""magic,"" I couldn't help but start laughing."
Well since they started they’re stupid tariffs everything went up and the market is taking the biggest dip in 60 years
"""Tariffs are a tax on a foreign country""

What this person fails to understand is that the capitalist system transcends individual intentions. Companies will inevitably pass the additional costs onto consumers, leading to higher prices. This can trigger inflation, which may result in reduced investment as interest rates rise in response. Overall, this is one of the least efficient ways to negotiate, as it disrupts the domestic economy of your country."
Then why are you punishing Canada and your allies? Why are you 25% tariff on Canada and only 10% on China? Who is more of your adversary Canada or China?
I just love when former officials come on liberal media and show why they are no longer employed.
"With President Trump serving as the 47th president of the United States, there's significant potential for a major market rally, presenting great opportunities for wealth creation. By investing in stocks and digital assets instead of keeping your money in banks, you can capitalize on this surge and build considerable wealth."
"Hey it feels like its more accurate to say ""expect $200.00+ for every trip to the store despite the small list."
Now why would 60 Minutes give this guy oxygen?
"President Trump has done ""the tariff"" thing in his first term and has done it very successfully"
"Should we trust anybody who was with Trump? I don't think so! Hey, you, Lighthizer, tell Trump to print his bible here in America!"
Wondering if Trump ever watches 60 Minutes or he just listens to the lobbyists.
mega people protesting for trump for a year straight and never actually knew how tariffs work
Raising tariffs on countries that already have tariffs on the US is not a horrible idea but there will be repercussions
I saw the speech from the prime minister of Canada. He has so much grace and poise. What a shame that Trump got another term!!!!
"Here’s the problem: Tariffs COULD be useful if they are used in certain ways. However, Trump doesn’t know HOW or WHY he really wants to use them. He has stated a host of self-contradictory and mutually nullifying reasons for using them. Trump is not a strategist just an impulsive haggler."
This cheif is wrong citizens will pay the taxes.
Americans can keep their factories if they are willing to take a pay cut to compete with the international labor force. This is why manufacturing in the US is more focused on automation in the long term anyways.
"“He’s a hero because he was captured? I like the ones who weren’t captured.” - Donald Trump, 2015"
"My main concern is how to survive all of these financial and political crisis, especially in light of the US political power scuffle. The government has really called things more difficult for its citizens, and we can't sit back and bear all the consequences of the bad governance."
It’s over America. Get used to it. No one is bringing it back.
"This guys a fool!!
Import tariffs don't help the average, end-user American consumer when our economy is based on a Capitalistic ideology!  "
This kind of nation wide important decisions should not be made by a single person. It should be economists' job to choose the best economical options. The USA have never been a  monarchy and hopefully will never be.
What is Congress doing? Tell us how we  can help Im tired of watching all of this. Feeling Helpless and Hopeless
Lol I love how he had to pull us aside for a sec to explain to us what tariffs actually are
This guy is a joke. Kuck rock man. He has not been in the grocery stores
Well at least we now know where Trump is getting his false information from.
"This guy is talking a lot of nonsense, the world's economy is interdependent, and the US can't isolate itself from the rest of the world. China is the 2nd largest economy with billions of people and decoupling won't work."
3:26 US manufacturing jobs were stable until Bush rolled into town with his de-regulation. Which also led us to the great recession of 2008 and spent 6 trillion dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet people want more re-regulation?
"U.S. tariffs are like trying to diet by locking the fridge—sure, you’ll eat less, but now everyone at the grocery store is mad at you."
Reaganonics was horrible. Globalization is here to stay. Instead of tariffs just ban certain products that would instead be made here.
"Everyone call your representatives, everyday, twice a day. Don’t write or email!"
"Trump 1.0 tariffs promised he would fix the trade deficit.  What happened?  Oh, yeah...we got higher prices, lost trade to other countries, had to bail out some of the US affected industries and he didn't fix anything.  So now we should expect that Trump 2.0 tariffs will work?"
200$ a month tax food for everyone. Sneaky way to tax consumers.
Aside from Apple and PCs there isn’t a single American product that I would like to buy. This is just going to cost me money.
nothing worse than a lying lawyer trying to sound like an educated economist. good grief.
They are extremely short-sighted. Things are already backfiring so badly.
This guy doesn't understand the costs of bringing manufacturing back to America
"In the 1970s and before that, you could leave high school and work in a factory.  Some people worked their whole life in factories. The benefits were great. Eventually,  US corporations didn't want to pay Americans wages and benefits. Many companies left and went to China and Mexico looking for cheap labor."
"Lol, I don't ""pay the tariff"" if I don't buy the products. It's time to rethink consumerism."
He's from Reagan era with their trickle down economics - how'd that work out for you
"corporate greed is the thing to blame, raising prices because they no longer have to compete with foreign good is un-patriotic, if they decide to do that. forcing the essential people that make this country run down"
"This is just like spectator sport to these people. They get to go back home to their cushy lives while everyone else has to endure the imminent dumpster fire. 

They know tariffs are not intended to be used in this way. No need for speculation, just do a little bit of honest research. This is obviously a smoke screen for something more sinister."
This guy speaks a little like RFK JR
It's Smoot-Hawley meets Dunning-Krueger
It’s the American greed of corporations and CEOs that cause the most trouble…Maybe make 298 Million a year in profits instead of 300 million and pay people correctly. Then that money stays here…
"Don’t we already have the best economy in the world.  The last I checked china, germany and others are not doing well.  Wtf?   And why don’t we leave mexico and Canada out and just tariff china."
"Tariffs should be on polluters. On the oil cartels who pollute and spread disinformation about climate, renewables and EVs. Tariffs should NOT be on the consumer goods."
Lighthizer makes me embarrassed  to be an old white guy.
Remember in the 90s when “made in America” and “my choice is America’s choice” was a HUGE thing? The economy was great back then.
What is it with Trump and people with weird voices.
"Tariffs should be viewed as a long-term strategic economic tool, with a focus on their sustained impact on trade dynamics and domestic industry development, rather than being assessed solely on short-term effects."
"Lighthizer talks like an angry, uneducated Karen."
Higher prices where the poor shop. The common maga is uneducated.
"Remove all ownership of real estate from any foreign investors, unless they live in the USA 6+ months out of the year... We have HOA owners who are not even in the USA 1 month of the year and collect 10's of $millions... If you are not a US perm citizen you do not deserve US $money."
"Imported cars, besides being affordable , are very reliable . American car  manufacturers cannot compete in reliability. If they change course we will buy more.  Sorry to say it, but most will buy a Honda or toyota because it last twice as long."
"I really think Trump knows what he's doing actually, God bless America regardless. Rahul Gupta completely transformed my life. I speak from experience: if you are having financial problems or looking to improve your finances, trust Rahul. He is someone you can fully trust"
Start the impeachment process now 
We must absolutely strategically decouple from China. We for far too long have done nothing while China rapidly grows and subverts our interest. We however should not bully our allies especially our neighbors who stood with us in battle and peacetime in order to expand our physical foot print. We are on the verge of threatening our most strategic alliances.
There is no middle class.
This guy ever own a small business!!???
Tax the companies with operations overseas! They need to contribute to the U.S. economy instead of just profiting from it.
Our government allowed this to happen.
"If groceries keep going up, I will apply for Gov food assistance.  If I can't get it I try the Food Banks.  If that fails, I guess I will be homeless just to buy food.  Many are already on the edge."
CBS didn't mention a word abt higher prices the last 4 years
this guy is 2 years away from sounding like RFK
Can't believe all those trumpets clapping thinking china pays the tax 
he is neither an economist nor an engineer...Just an outdated lawyer...
I think this is going to teach Americans not to buy what they don’t need. Time to stop buying things you don’t need on temu or Amazon! Save your money you will need it!
Haha. Just don't buy anything unless you truly NEED it.
It will take years to raise the production inside America !
America needs to build their own manufacturing facilities. America citizens need employment that’s why crime is so high in America. The citizens should be making their own products. Corporations have bankrupt America.
"Feel sorry for Robert Lighhtizer. Hope he goes back to school and take his medication. Trade deficits are caused by fiscal deficits. Increase savings and cut consumption, the demand will evaporate and trade will balance itself."
So we eat less avocados  and more beans  now?? 🫘
"Remember when the tariffs were ""an economic tool for negotiation""? That was funny."
"This supposed Trump expert doesn’t agree with 90% of economists so he is wrong, wrong, wrong. Businesses will lay off people period."
Trade deficits or surpluses are neither inherently good or bad.  Thinking otherwise will lead to terrible economic policy.
A 25% tariff on Canada compared to a 10% tariff on China the producer of a vast amount of cheap crap to say the very least of the risks and problems with China is stupid and insulting.
This will cause a Great Depression.
"I'd like to tell the snobbish and haughty American politicuians of the Trump type, ""Wake up the times have changed; we're in the 21st century, and American gangster beghavior won't work as it used to...."
The game is over. But the US still thinks it can win.
At this point in time. I will have to start backing the bolder in Colorado for US president.
"This doesn't seem like a good gamble, but then again, i am pretty dumb. I hope small businesses are ready to take a good hit."
“If this doesn’t work”…we’ll go using what failed in the past…while blaming the democrats for it
We can turn this current situation around with the help from our allies. Is he referring to the allies we are placing tariffs on and losing good standing with?
"The U.S government PROPAGANDA says China pay for the tariffs, if that's the case, let raise the tariffs to 1,000% , so Americans don't need to work at all just sit back and collect tariffs money from China "
"Tariffs have some similarities to sanctions in some ways, because it impacts on the society at large (cost of living, job losses, cut on government budget such as health, education, crime, defense etc).   For over two decades my country Eritrea has been under crippling US & EU sanctions because they hated the government and they wanted to achieve regime change agenda.  But the sanctions only hurt poor citizens of the country denying them basic services and as a result causing some take the extreme measures to migrate to other countries.   
The west specially the US often applied sanctions to several countries using all sorts of reason to justify the sanctions.  Countries like Cuba, Zimbabwe, Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, and many more have suffered from evil US and EU sanctions.  If unless Western powers change their foreign policy to non-interventionist policy then there will always be migrants from countries that they sanctioned, coming to their shores.   The irony is majority of Americas and Europeans don’t understand the link between migration and Western interventionist foreign policy."
"Everything is already so expensive now, imagine in a month? We Americans are f."
"They need to exempt fruits and vegetables. People need to eat, there is not enough USA supply, this will really hurt children and the elderly and make chronic disease worse. Also very bad for small businesses & restaurants. At least give time for USA farmers to increase the supply, figure out their labor situations."
"”And I will make boys their princes, and infants shall rule over them.“
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭3‬:‭4‬ ‭"
"US economy is strong due to their companies exploiting low wages among other reasons abroad, American salaries are too high to bring competitive products and services within 3rd world economies"
Kinda huge boost to increase inequality. Riches will get more and more money.. Dead spiral like some ants do
Sounds like he mouthmated with RFK jr.
Eff walmart
"if tariffs are this bad, imagine how bad income taxes are"
He's scared of china
"Thanks for the information. I am 55 already with not enough set aside for retirement, I’ve always been curious about the market and have seen folks who did well in the market retire early, most say they went in small and grew over time, but I do not have that luxury, I have a good capital but I do not know how or what to do to get good outcome, I am open-minded and would appreciate any helpful advice."
"Financial education is crucial today to show incredible resilience and discipline in the volatile market, masterfully balancing strategy and insight for success. This dedication to continuous learning is inspiring...managed to grow a nest egg of around 2.1BTC to a decent 15B TC in the space of a few weeks... I'm especially grateful to Janet Harold, whose deep expertise and traditional trading acumen have been invaluable in this challenging, ever-evolving financial landscape."
If you trust 60 minutes good luck to you
I really think everyone should send a box of diapers to the White House because not only Trump is going to need them they're all going to need them
"This is a perfect opportunity for Canada to diversify its economy and do what BRICS nations are doing, trade in local currencies. More importantly, building an inter-provincial energy pipeline. Ontario and Quebec are hydro electric powerhouses and can leverage their exports of electricity to the US.

Presently, 87% of global trade is in U.S. dollars and the world is 400% GDP in debt, 200% of that is in U.S. dollars. Thus the reason why more and more nations are joining BRICS and trading in local currencies with the ultimate goal of moving away from the dollar reserve.

Keep in mind, the US doesn't have a manufacturing base anymore which is why they import pretty much everything from Asia and Mexico. What little they do manufacture will be affected by tarrifs, as the most efficient sources of supply will not be available because of regulations RESTRICTING importation from those sources, resulting in either second-best products or higher costs for restricted supplies. 

In other words, bringing back manufacturing to the USA is a pipe dream given the time and cost of building new factories which will be dependent on foreign parts loaded down with tarrifs!

Secondarily, any new factories would be premised on robotics, cnc and AI, doing little to create new jobs, much less alleviate unemployment.

The US oil sector is also problematic because its main oil producing states have stopped fracking due to earthquakes and damage caused to structures and foundations, resulting in class action lawsuits. 

Even Trump's recent Executive Order reveals how bad the oil and gas sectors are: ""The United States’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy. EO Jan 20, 2025

In short, the US is in a state of collapse and its income tax base can't cover the interest on its massive 36 trillion dollar debt, which is the main reason for the tarrifs."
"Tariffs serve many purposes. Obviously some are positives, and some are negatives. It depends also on which side of the fence you are sitting at. 

Tariffs do buy time for the weaker, noncompetitive industries to catch up, providing some breathing space. But it should never be used as a ""fix-all"" snake oil. In fact, I would regard tariffs as ""band-aid"". It provides temporary relief, it shields the wound from sight, but it won't cure the wound. It covers up the wound to keep away the unwanted elements such as bacteria and dust, but that is all. 

The US industries are overly dependent on tariffs for their survival. Politicians who come and go at a regular 4 year interval, are dying for votes to get in the White House. So buying votes is not beyond them, and tariffs is just the perfect tool to do that. What the politicians are doing is to kick the can of ""very things to do"" further down the track, for the successive administration. Biden got the can from Trump, and now Trump is holding that can, and is doing the same. Not only is Trump creating more tariffs, he is also making enemies out of allies namely Canada and Mexico. As for Chyaannah...Trump is soft peddling because he knows it does have leverage over the US, I am talking about critical minerals."
Im okay with having to pay 200 a month for groceries lol.
We're smart Geniuses we elected president Trump
My $2 dollar imported toilet brush will now cost $3.99.

"The BS is that in 10 years, neither he nor Trump will have to answer for it"
My life expectancy is about ten years. There is no going back for me.
"In 10 years he might not be alive to see his failures, so it’s easy for him to say let’s raise tariffs to 60% on one of the top 3 countries we trade with."
The nerve to say that if it doesn't work in 10 years we  ould always go back! ️
Ben Stein has been telling us since Ferris Buelers' day off! 
He has no clue
I going to start avoiding the grocery store.Eggs cost $10 dollars this isn’t joke.
He's completely ignoring the fact that China's economy is cratering due to over production and too little domestic demand.
"China's dominance of trade is largely due to the greed of US CEOs and shareholders squeezing maximum profit by moving manufacturing off-shore and basically giving US technology to the Chinese – who aren't stupid and take full advantage of the situation. It's not clear at all that tariff's can address the problem we have created for ourselves. We need to have incentives, regulations and above all, the educational system needed to train people for the jobs we're trying to bring back to the US. Unfortunately, regulations and investment in education seem to be very low-priority for the party in power, and tariff-mania looks to be very short-sighted and most likely ineffectual."
"they always claim ""new jobs, better this/that"" but never explain how. also lol ""figure it out"""
Tariffs did not cause the Great Depression. Inflation did.
Tariffs are a negotiating tool. Mexico just agreed to a 30 day pause.
"Not only is his plan economically faulty, but his strategy is entirely based on national security and military strength, yet he's entirely WRONG about how a nations military works, having ""larger"" is not better at all, you need quality and quantity within mission requirements. Also the US entire reason for free trade is to tie nations to us, NATO, the largest greatest military power to ever exist and it is already controlled by the US"
Notice how he leads with fearmongering.
Tariffs are taxes on a foreign country?!
Both Canada and Mexico caved today  one day after this video was posted.

Also, do you realize how hard a financial situation people are in the US. If this was a bargaining ploy, get renegotiated fast otherwise people cannot take more inflation on anything. The quality of life in the US is going down fast."
"He said, ""I believe in strategic decoupling."" OK, sounds like a logical position. But, slapping 25% tariffs on your neighbors won't help you achieve that, and it is self-defeating."
"Lighthizer is our guy. He is absolutely right about trade relations we've held for a long time. It will cause pain, but this must be done."
"I get his message. I just disagree on some fundamental procedural activities he wants to carry out. Australia is a good example of what can happen when high tariffs are maintained for an extended time frame. Long story short, it didn't work."

We are headed for a depression aren't we??
Tariffs are not a tax on a foreign country. The company who imports the goods to be able to sell in their stores or e-commerce site just passes on the increased cost to the consumer to protect their profit margin. Those are the facts.
"""No great civilization is conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within""
Greed has and will forever be the culprit."
We will be extremely fortunate if this doesn't cause a world wide depression.
"Tariffs ️ Inflation ️ rich, getting richer. Poor, getting poorer."
"Tariffs will ALWAYS become the consumer's burden.  Companies will NEVER eat the cost.  It will end up in higher prices at the registers....so in the end, it's the consumer who pays.  So, please tell me how this is better for the economy."

"If Robert had been born in Beijing, and was the top trade advisor the chinese government, he would have said  the exact same thing in describing how the US was an existential threat, how the US wanted to be #1 in the world.
And he would be right..."
How will Wal-Mart survive
Oh ok. I need to pay higher prices! Rich people trying to convince average people we need to pay more.
This guy is delusional.
The real benefit of a tariff is to make goods produced elsewhere more competitive…..such as making things here again.
"China sends a $2000 computer to the USA, USA sends $2000 to China.  Now we have a computer, they have dollars.  That's not a wealth transfer, that's a trade."

"CEOs are beholden to the shareholders - so their ""figuring it out"" will be to pass tariff costs onto consumers, raising prices to ensure the profit margin wont be cut into. Too high of prices then the market wont buy. Less sales = less profit. Less sales = layoffs and higher unemployment, tanking economy. And the majority VOTED FOR THIS."
"The people in these comments, average people, are critiquing an actual billionaire's plans to fix the economy. This would be like a bunch of average Joes watching an Arnold Schwarzenegger bodybuilding documentary and ruthlessly critiquing his methods."
I love nothing more than buying quality American made products.  But it’s hard to find them or find someone who sells domestic products.  It has gotten better over the last ten years I feel.
"""Top U.S. trade negotiator"" "
And don is distancing US from our allies
"Media continue to miss the point: Trump isn’t threatening or implementing tariffs to have us pay more, but rather to get these nations to cooperate in other ways."
Smart economists should know how to balance profit for manufacturers and reasonable prices for consumers.
I agree with him but the problem is the physical infrastructure in the US isn’t there right now because manufacturing jobs left to go overseas decades ago.
If a country sells 300 billion to you and they only buy 50 billion of your product how do tariffs hurt you
"You know what, there are probably a dozen things over the last decade that I regularly used to attack Trump for being ""wrong"" about. Turns out he was actually right about most of those things. It's taught me to ignore the media and their agenda, do my own research, and be open-minded to what the guy has to say and plans to do. Since I don't have a choice anyway, I'm going to wait and see on this one before condemning it based on my comparatively limited understanding of the subject matter."
"Right? And then when the demand for steel goes up, we'll build more steel plants.It's gonna hurt at first, but it will get better"
I’m in procurement I can tell you buyers will look inward (domestic sources) vs buying from a different company where possible if the contract is flexible.  This is catastrophic for Canadian producers whose industry relies on roughly 75% exports.
American WILL NEVER OVER COME THIS POINT BLANK PERIOD!!
The high consumer prices are not all related to the tariffs. Supply chain management and lean manufacturing is key.
"I mean maybe we need to pay more. Were the most obese nation maybe less food would be a good thing. I used to make swords out of sticks played army with guns made of sticks spent all day outside played nintendo at night. We ate home cooked meals no mcdonalds no super walmarts no taco bell. Things were easier my Step dad made $6 a hour smoked marlboro reds drank budweiser had a nice bronco. My mom didnt work had a camaro he only made $6 a hour. That was only 45 years ago. The government and companies have sold us down the river for cheaper and less quality goods. Its everything its school,tv programs, cellphones have all made us less productive. Maybe tarrifs are not the answer but there has to be one."
Every family will be worse than before. A tariff passes to the consumer. The prices are up or there are not enough products. Tariffs are not the solution. This man is totally out of reality.
"Tariffs will increase the prices of daily goods. Consequently, Americans as the consumers will have to pay more for the necessities.  :(."
It’s not a tax when it’s MADE in the USA … that’s the point …. We need more goods made in the USA
"“Subsidies in some areas”… His idea will lead to huge government subsidies in many areas to offset tariffs. For those looking to cut government spending and agree with this policy, good luck!"
This would not bode well for Walmart and other cheap retailers.   Prices will increase significantly on most consumer goods.
"Also, he said if it doesnt work in 10 years we can go back. This guy is playing checkers with our lives."
"Instead of tariffs on import buyers, why not incentivize companies to bring back jobs to America?"
Man said in 10 years if it doesn’t work we can just go back…. This somebody they paid to analyze these situations for us saying this 
"When President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the leaders of both countries immediately capitulated and gave in to his demands.

And it's not because they were worried that American consumers might have to start paying more."
"I love the last comment because when it comes to economics, you should always be prepared that you may have been wrong."
So let's raise taxes via tarrifs on the average American citizen rather than provide positive incentives for companies to come here.
Take away the competition and then US companies raise prices. Easier than taking millions to develop infrastructure to produce more. It gives US companies to gouge prices because they know consumers want products.
Who is watching 60 minutes anymore?
"I live near enough to the Canadian border in Washington state to listen to their radio stations. I have been hearing call in shows daily on the topic of US tariffs. There are Canadian businesses protesting tariffs by refusing to work with the US now. The communities here, such as Bellingham, will see far less money spent from across the border. They are pulling out of existing relationships with the US right and left. Cancelling trips, anything that brings money to the US is subject to protest by individuals, businesses and corporations at this time. They are working to provide more of their own goods and looking for better options across the world for things they'll need to import. Canadians are rising to the challenge. Washington businesses and others that rely on Canadian dollars should prepare for upcoming major hits."
So it will cost 200 a month per family?  Why are we even questioning it?
American CONSUMERS decide where production  is gonna take place.Either pay 2000 dollars  for a  iPhone produced in China or 3500 for one produced  in the USA.
"Those who voted for Trump, arrived late to God's distribution of brains..."
"If China is so bad for us to trade with, why is the China tariff 10% and Canada and Mexico 25%?"
"Ever notice it's never the ultra-rich ""tightening their belts?"""
"My recommendation to President Trump is to set a standard that all American producers must manufacture at least 60% of their products here in the US, and only allow up to 40% to go overseas. In addition, American manufacturers must keep all their machine tools here in the US."
"Even if tariffs result in some more manufacturing in the USA, the price of those manufactured goods will be much higher for Americans."
collecting taxes from other countries? Yeah right
"No one knows anything. The last time Trump did this, it 'reduced' the price of US Steel, and it increased GDP. The economic illiteracy is staggering. Is this allowed to be published? Let's test it."
"Even if this works to reduce fentanyl, crime will go up."
most of American companies moved abroad because they seek cheaper labor thus  jobs lost in America.
"The trade deficit is absurd and unfair to America. We’ve lost so many manufacturing jobs over the last few decades. The middle class is barely making ends meet.

What do we have to lose but give this new strategy a try? I believe that the tariffs will bring temporary pain but will provide long term gains back to the United States. 🇺🇸"
Why not have a direct tax on a manufacturer if they produce out of country. That would bring them back in a flash.
Might.could.may.possibly  ROTFLMAO small but very important words.
"7:05 No! Americans will pay the for the taxes on imported items from foreign countries. So Americans will pay higher prices for imported products. Dear MAGAs, you will get negative money for higher tariffs on foreign countries!"
"Just a bump in the road , these changes will all benefit America"
Let’s try tariffs. What we’re doing sure ain’t working.
"Saying that tariffs are costs that will be just be passed on the Americans, fail to understand that tariffs increase the price of foreign goods which will result in less of those foreign goods purchased by Americans. A portion of those types of goods (if they are now purchased at all) will be purchased from other sources and a certain amount of them from American sources, if possible. The first statement is like saying, the cost of products doesn't matter, it does."
"Trade war is like hail mary pass. If it works the QB will be a hero, if fail every body will hate the QB."
"Tariffs don't do any good for U.S. trade or exports, because of retaliatory tariffs. They have been tried 13:20. It's just a disguised way of putting a relatively higher portion vs income of the U.S. debt on the lower classes rather than the upper classes."
"June 17, 1930 history doesn’t repeat itself, but it most certainly rhymes"
He sounds something like RFK Jr and is all wrong. 
"Tariffs: Taxes, higher costs on the consumer. HE PLAYED MAGA FANS LOL!!!"
It's been a roller coaster since COVID but now it a dive and there's no brakes with forced setbacks.
Greed caused all of this to begin with.  Large corporations need to be taught lessons about over charging us.... BUY LESS...lose weight.
"The argument: Walmart pays the tarriff and passes it on to the consumer.
The rest of the argument: the consumers buy less product, so Walmart buys less of the product from China, so China lowers the price. 
Final result: China pays the tarriff."
Corporate greed . Charge corporate greed
Everyone who voted for chump don’t understand this
he's not saying the quiet things out loud. Just the one thing and that's not enough.
It’s funny how Ronald Reagan gave him his first job at the White House because Ronald Reagan was very much for free and fair trade and not tariffs
Trump 
American companies will see the higher prices of foreign goods on the shelves.....and follow suit. They can't miss out on corporate profits.
Make America More Expensive
"So if a USA collects more taxes on imported goods and this harms our economy, why would Canada and Mexico do the same thing and harm their economy?  I'm all for decoupling from China, we can still buy sneakers, textiles, and low tech stuff from them.  We are in a Cold War with China, Americans need to realize that.  The standard of living has peaked in the USA, and that's not a bad thing.  We don't need all the junk and 3000' sqft homes to live a happy life.  I'm okay with stepping it down a notch or two.  My Grandkids will grow up living a simpler, more satisfying life.  Mental health and obesity are at all time highs, this lifestyle is not working very well."
"So the CEOs will have higher operating costs and they’re going to RAISE wages? 
These people are lunatics!"
"760 American military bases worldwide 
Maximum of 4 Chinese military bases worldwide 
Wake up world 
Who is the bully"
Average American consumers- are we a joke to you?
"It's simple economics, people.  If you want affordable products, you either need to accept low wages and have them made in America or give up your job and allow someone in another country who is willing to work for those same low wages.  You can't have both.

Gone are the days of $50 an hour union auto worker jobs with an hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks."
They charge us tariffs but we can’t charge them any
"There is one important difference between what this man advises and what Trump is doing, which no one mentions. He advises imposing tariffs not on all products, but only on certain goods of strategic value. Trump, on the other hand, imposes tariffs on (almost) all products. That’s like cutting a sandwich with a chainsaw."
"As per my humble opinion, people living in the USA should be ready now for a tsunami of inflation+recession."
"China Trade with the U.S can be explained with the ""The elephant curve"" is a graph that illustrates how different global economic classes have grown over time. The graph is shaped like an elephant, with the trunk representing the global elite, the torso representing the middle class, and the tail representing the extreme poor. Meaning the wealthy in America have benefited  from trade with China. Unlike in China where the poor working class benefited from trade with the U.S. If anything it's the top 1% fault why America lost so many jobs to China, they just took it when we gave it to them."
This man is definitely on the spectrum.
"You guys suspiciously glossed over some more important points about these tariffs. 
The most important point is that the large companies have been doing what is called front loading. They are stocking up warehouses so that they can afford to add a buffer by stocking up local warehouses, and meanwhile their smaller competitors that also rely on imports are going to thrown out of business and eliminated as competition.
All in all, your budget Walmart and Amazon is going to be able to price them out further.
Small and medium business is and has been under threat. That's never good."
one thing is for sure the old way is not working out so let the new process play out.
“You do that and your Allies will run to you”…. Not when you tarif them to destruction….
"Lighteners opening line describes the U.S. perfectly. We as a nation ascribe to what he said exactly. Since we compete on those terms, we should expect that another super power will compete to win as well. There has never been a winner of anything that was able to maintain their position forever. It’s virtually impossible. Capitalism mandates economic war. You win some, you lose some. Now it’s time for the U.S. to lose. The Chinese people experienced the fastest growth of its middle class in human history and they were not number one in the economy war. It certainly didn’t hurt China overall to be second while they aspired to be number one. It won’t hurt us as well as long as our government acts accordingly. Our present fascist regime will hurt us more than the economic war with China will."
"What this guy is saying makes sense but it's about China, not about Mexico, Canada or EU.
China has 1.4 billion people, even if they get to half of the US GDP per Capita, they'll be twice as big as the US economy wise. 
The US is alienating its friends, not the way of decreasing the economic strength of China, it's the opposite."
This policy sounds like the 2020s version of trickle-down economics.
"Here is a question I always ask regarding trade deficits- who do we blame - the manufacturers who move to another country for cheaper labor, or the consumers who want those cheaper goods, ?"
This guy doesn't want to acknowledge that it's corporate greed that caused the trade deficits. This guy is just promoting bullying and scapegoating to confuse people about who is to blane.
"I guess the problem in USA is that the country is run by a business man or men, her economy is run by a lawyer not economist, diplomatic is run by also a lawyer instead a diplomat.  "
"Well if the US needs them, then why has Pres Trump and Mexican Pres Sheinbaum worked something out to put off for 30 days tariffs on Mexico? You would think Trump would stick with this tariff that the US needs."
Mainstream media is going to cry about this XAI308K coin so hard soon
"The person who purchases a product is the one who pays the tax, regardless where that product was manufactured. So, when Trump puts 25% tariffs on Canada, that 25% gets added to the cost of the product."
200 a month to make America great again ??…. Sounds like a good investment
No wonder Trump chose you …. 
"wouldnt it have been a better idea to build the factories before implementing the tariffs? Because its going to take 2-4 years for any new manufacturing plants to open and start producing goods,"
"Let me explain to this expert. Why Americans are losing their jobs is because labor is expensive in the US. People of the US wants to be paid high, work life balance and cheap everything.  You can't get best of everything realistically. So due to this, your American businesses migrated manufacturing outta US for cheaper labor. Theres just no way jobs will be back to US when labor is expensive."
Does he have that Kennedy throat 
Those of us who voted for TRUMP are fine with price increaaes. 
"Tariffs were a major factor in the Great Depression, but they were not the sole cause. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and retaliatory tariffs from other countries reduced American imports and exports by 67%. This made the Great Depression worse and slowed recovery."
They will drop the prices once they see no one is buying there products.
"We didn’t lose any industry, we decided to give it ip shut it down and have someone else do it. Very simple. These industries didn’t go away against our will."
Very interesting video thank you for sharing!
He doesn’t address AT ALL the senseless tariffs on Mexico and Canada
Is the stock market's continuous desire for more a root cause in all of this debate? Increase revenues through increased pricing? People dislike inflation. Increase market size? People debate the pros and cons of foreign markets. Decrease costs? Shrink-flation. Cheaper labour. Cheaper materials.
It's almost funny how everyone is an economists.
"Then why not to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, while lowering the ones of Canadian, Mexican, 3rd world countries' goods? wouldn't that be good blow to the Chinese hegemony?"
"Folks, the US Dollar has been LOSING value to the BRICS gold-backed currency (the Unit) at an alarming rate (with ever-increasing numbers of nations joining the BRICS Intergovernmental Organization), and these tariffs will only dramatically accelerate the wholesale depreciation of the Dollar, in an exponential manner! Therefore, defaulting has become a VERY REAL possibility for America!

But then, I am a wealthy Futures Markets day-trader, so I will be just fine! But, will ALL of your loved-ones??"
He really needs to take a first year economics class to understand what’s going on in the world.
He sounds like if RFK had a normal voice
"In 2022, fentanyl was responsible for 200 deaths every day. Over a quarter of a million Americans have died from a fentanyl overdose since 2018. In 2022, 73,654 people died from a fentanyl overdose in the US, more than double the amount of deaths from three years prior in 2019.

As of February 1, 2025, the population of the United States was 346,512,950. This makes the United States the third most populated country in the world."
"What a joke. You didn’t ask and he didn’t say…tariffs are like war -  easy to start, almost impossible to stop. Once a tariff is levied it’s there to stay."
The US Army is the only one that can fight a war on its own. So while China has the biggest army in the world does not necessary mean they are the strongest.
Not one mention of supply chains just being shifted to other cheaper countries.
I trust 60 Minutes!
"If Walmart imports a goods with high tariffs, put on their shelves with locally produced goods with lower price tags, which one will the consumer buy?"
So where did the view of “tariffs will hurt foreign countries because they would have to pay extra for goods brought into US” come from?? Tariffs have nothing to do with foreign suppliers? Never quite understood how tariffs work against foreign producers.
Corporations lead the move to other countries because of profits and now they have leveraged that and now they see that its unsustainable.
Nobody will be able to afford stuff made in the US.
Is there going to be a 60% tariff on Trump bibles from China?
Why is a lawyer commenting on economics?
Tariffs are needed.
"What the most Americans are ignoring is the fact that the tariffs wont just hit the economy bad, it will hurt the geopolitics and diplomacy worse. If the USA can impose tariffs on Mexico and  Canada even after Free Trade agreement, well the USA can really go for anything and that will not instill much faith on other countries too. And with the latest news on imposing tariffs on UK and the EU, China is having the biggest laugh in the decades."
"""... under Reagan"", I think we've heard enough."
Aren’t prices already high? 
Lighthizer sounds like a flat earther with his tariff theory. The real economists of the world view Trumps tariffs as a massive mistake. The U.S. is getting flatter by the minute.
"We get so hung up on saving ""jobs"" that we completely ignore productivity. Find a way to utilize people to their fullest, instead of artificially propping up industries that can't compete.  We can't wall ourselves off from the world."
We didn’t lose anything because of foreign nations. We lost it because of America greed
"this only works if you can assume that CEOs aren't greedy, does anyone believe that to NOT be the case?"
"It's cheaper to manufacture abroad, because the wage is higher in US. That's why US company moved factory abroad!!!"
"I'm not sure how I feel about it all. I have little confidence that the administrations cares for poor and middle class people, I do know that. I wish there was an adult in the room."
We don't have the ability infrastructure set up to make things locally. It needs to be done after we have local alternatives
Inflation reduction act? Jobs act? Chips act? Infrastructure act? Are jobs not coming back?
"He keeps talking about ""us, together with our allies can do anything."" But we keep attacking our allies. Will we even have allies left by the end of this? We're aspiring for isolationism right now, not collaboration."
"""We need subsidies in certain areas.""  Do you mean another bailout for farmers and the auto industries?"
This guy thinks CEO's won't lay people off? How naive
Who thought that Carlos Tavares needed 30 mil as a salary?  Closing Belvedere was wrong.  Clearer heads have prevailed and now mid- size trk will be built there.  Always a mopar fan.  Good luck with the new truck.!
What is wrong with the American education system?
"In 2023, the top 5% of earners in the United States paid approximately 66% of the total federal individual income tax revenue. Given that the total individual income tax revenue was about $2.18 trillion, this means the top 5% contributed roughly $1.4 trillion."
"Walmart, We're rolling up prices everyday!"
America has outsourced its way into debt via corporations.
"Start with capping income levels here in the US first, let’s say, 3 million a year, cap inheritance to no more than 3 million. Get the greed down to a more manageable level and get rid of billionaires."
"Once again, it always starts with Reagan"
"We the Consumers will pay the high prices, stay tuned they are coming soon."
"All of this is a bunch of lies. Just pay people a fair wage and lower prices on all goods and services. Let the CEO’s and those at the top take the loss, they’ve ate of the little man long enough. Problem solved."
"So why not just put 100% tariffs, why stop at 10% or 25%?"
"Even ""balanced"" trade increases costs on ALL consumers and will crater ALL economies!"
"If Trump does not implement tariffs, then all these big companies/corporations will continue to take all the manufacturing jobs outside of United States, people in America are the one who are suffering their losing their jobs while these big companies reaps the benefits. It’s not right!"
Basically he is about how to give as much money to billionaires as possible as we can at the expense of everyday Americans.
"The best way to bring manufacturing back is to give up the status of global reserve currency. Which will likely happen if we keep up this type of activity, sanctioning and taxing our trade partners for goods we buy with dollars we print from thin air."
Actually I did know about Robert Lighthizer  Who wrote that intro?
"Exaggerated and one sided. This is capitalism and free market economy. The American ""entrepreneurs"" and ""businessmen"" used cheap labor in China to make products and bring them home for larger profits, and now you are complaining about this free market economy? You can't have cake and eat it too. You can't expect other countries to be your cheap labor forever. They can learn and do the same thing. 
Now, placing tariffs on products that you no longer make will only cause inflation. Placing tariffs on products that your country makes could be useful if it does not encourage your own manufacturer to bring down quality."
The final sentence is crucial. A decade-long social experiment to determine its effectiveness.
The USA has not been Able to Do Total Manufacturing since the mid 1980’s!!
"The US does NOT have the manufacturing capability to provide cheaper, domestic alternatives to foreign goods. So the way tariffs used to work, IE foreign stuff is expensive so we buy local, is not the way they will work now. Because when the price goes up thanks to tariffs, you dont HAVE a cheap option to pick. You either have to pay the inflated price or do without."
60 miniutes sux....smells like propagana from here
"I hope Robert is right, but I am skeptical."
Wall to wall coverage of tariffs AFTER the election. Where was the media during the election explaining this complicated subject????
"I am a Trump supporter however, I think taxation on another country equals war. But I do feel we need to bring jobs back to America and put America to work again that’s what needs to be done. I don’t think tariff some other countries is the way to go."
"Someone mentioned that workers greedy is the problem . . . Not true!!!! 
Back in the 70s the average ceo made 20 to 30 times more than the average worker!!! Today it's more like 200 to 300 times more than the average worker!!!! 
And furthermore,  I never heard of a ceo moving back in with mom and pops because they can't afford to pay today's rent prices "
"No shortage of stupid and ignorance in America these days.
For most of recorded history China has been the world leader in science, exploration, medicine, astronomy, engineering, trade, metallurgy, yet Americans were taught since childhood that ' America is the greatest country in the world '.
What a joke and insult."
"This guy really don’t care about the working class due to his words saying the CEOs will figure it out and not cut jobs to do so, he has  no rational thought on how CEOs will keep jobs and make a profit. Labor is a cost big corporations are always trying to cut, and they have a scapegoat to cut jobs and they will"
No more IRS. we need the ERS!!!.. Its time to bring back manufacturing to the US
"He's lying about that, we all have to pay higher taxes at the store for what we buy and the poor people will pay the price "
"There was a 2019 Midwest manufacturing recession that keeps being forgotten about. And, it came on the heels of Trump shutting down the gov't for 6 weeks that January."
"For 60 minutes to point at the great depression, and to state tariffs were the reason it happened is crazy.  No manipulation by JP Morgan and others crashing the stock/bond markets?... no mention of the ""federal reserve""... really?"
Ironic that what we did to England in the first Industrial Revolution China is doing to us in this Revolution
Its a delicate balance.   It doesn't necessarily mean jobs.  It may be more automation
"Tariffs will punish the consumers. That is precisely their intention. America is in debt, more so its consumers, due to conspicuous consumption. This will force them to prioritize spending, and cut down on debt. The rest, who couldn’t manage, will be on the soup line. Tough love from Trump."
"Manufacturing jobs have been moved from developed and wealthy countries or cities to the poorer ones, while replacing with jobs that require innovation and people with advanced degrees. To make a country strong and wealthy, the government should give up on manufacturing jobs and focus on advanced developments."
If every parts of a computer is made in USA then can an average American afford to buy one?
"He talks about semi-conductors.  Maybe it would be good to have semi-conductor manufacturing in the US, but building a fabrication plant for semi-conductors takes 3-4 years minimum, 7000 construction workers, and would cost over 10 billion dollars to build.  For one plant.  Biden made some progress on encouraging semi-conductor manufacturing in the US, but he ran into a problem - there aren't anywhere near enough people in the US who have the two-years of training needed to work at such a plant. So even if the tariffs have exactly the effect Lighthizer is looking for, it could be 5 years before semi-conductors start rolling off of the line. And of course, those semi-conductors would be much more expensive because American workers demand higher wages that Chinese workers. 

Look at t-shirts.  You can buy a six-pack of Hanes t-shirts (made elsewhere) for around $18. That's $3/shirt.  There are a bunch of companies selling made-in-the-USA t-shirts, for $15/shirt. So when Elon Musk says that tariffs will cause Americans ""temporary hardship"" due to higher prices, know that it won't be all that temporary.

Tariffs are very difficult to undo once they are done.  As has already happened, when you place tariffs on imports from a country, that country responds with tariffs on your imports. So now removing the tariffs is a trade negotiation.  Meanwhile, businesses in those other countries immediately start looking for other places to sell their goods - it's a big world. By the time tariffs are repealed, all of those suppliers we used to depend on will have moved on to more reliable and less fickle customers.

Speaking of fickle - Trump had to label these tariffs as ""emergency"" to avoid violating trade deals that TRUMP signed with Canada and Mexico less that 5 years ago. We signed the Paris Climate Agreement, Trump pulled us off of it, Biden signed us back on, and now Trump has pulled us out of it again.  How long before countries stop trusting the United States as a reliable partner? If someone welches on all of their bets, how long to keep inviting them to your poker night?"
I am absolutely shocked that we need to explain.  Are people so ignorant that this needs to be explained.   Shame on education. Shane on people for not wanting to be educated
You lost semmiconductors?  First you allowed that because of greed!
"American private corporations outsource manufacturing to exploit cheap labor, putting American operators out of work.  President then accuses foreign adversaries of stealing those jobs, applies what he mistakes for a tax against them as punishment, which the out-of-work American ultimately has to pay.  The cycle of greed and incompetence is complete."
"You lost manufacturing jobs, because you want cheap stuff. If you want $100 phones costing $500 but US made, then go on with tariffs."
God help the USA  America needs a strategic tariff plan. And I believe it will.
gonna do my groceries at the asian market now in spite of tariffs
"foreign vehicles are more dependable and made than domestic vehicles. GM, Ford and Chryslers are not as dependable and the quality is subpar."
"I'm sorry, but I don't have TEN YEARS TO FAFO!  I don't have the years and I don't have the money."
Sounds like this guy makes as much as the wealthiest CEO’s. He’s not worried about out how $200/mo will affect him. How many can hold out 10 years to find out!?
"It's always reassuring when an expert from another sector claims to know more about the other expert's field, like a lawyer about economics. (Sarcasm warning. )"
This will happen all over the country.
His self confidence comes from the fact he can wait out any depression from a trade war cause he’s gotten rich giving theoretical advice to the GOP who always seem to destroy the economy every 4-8 years.
Ain't no country took no jobs from America when every corporation over here close down shop and move over seas
"I’m concerned as I would be with any large change. I’m going to hold off on drawing any conclusions until I see what happens. 

The US could end up with higher inflation and higher  interest rates as a result. However, this could also cause higher unemployment, which will bring down interest rates. I realize there are other factors at play but I’m just pointing out the area that I know. 

The only thing happening for sure is that some industries and their workers will suffer. One side says they’ll suffer for the greater good and the other says they’re the tip of the iceberg of economic doom. 

At this point we have little impact on what happens."
I listened to this interview and everything he said is wrong tariffs might work in certain circumstances but the tariffs that Trump has put on Canada and Mexico are just plain stupid and the American people are the ones who will suffer because of his total lack of knowledge
"So this guy has been around since Ronald Reagan trickle down economics, and we're still giving him time. Thanks but no thanks."
Did Elon Musk just abandon Doge coin and make his own XAI308K coin? WOW this guys a genius lol
You can’t beat the cheap labor in other countries. That is why these companies moved overseas in the first place. If the importer pays the tariff and passes it on to consumers this will be a disaster. Trump wants to pay for his massive corporate tax cuts. This is what this is all about.
"Buy these things localy ,meet demand grow more matter of time."
Existential threat to the U.S.?  This guy is so insecure.
"Is Canada an existential threat? Isn't there a smarter move to even out our trade?

And to wait ""ten years"" to see if it works?"
"Yes please, self sufficient, buy from home, we are not required to buy foreign products. Rebuild our factories."
"I really want to emphasize that we are way past the nineteenth-century; global trade is not simply importing raw materials to manufacture finished good.
We import raw materials, WIPs (works-in-progress), components, and finished goods and export eaw materials, WIPs, components, and finished goods.
There is a good article from the WSJ that covers a bathtub manufacturer in Utah, whose bathtub is made with ~1,850 parts received from seven countries and fourteen states. Some parts, like the water pump, travel through multiple countries before ending up in the Utahan factory.
We can not simply throw a tariff on a country and expect jobs to come back; we simply disrupt the entire supply chain and may be forced to purchase from another country because we do not have and never have had the production for a certain component.

EDIT: I want to clarify that I am not a free-trade shill and do think that it was a good decision to abolish NAFTA and implement the USMCA, which streamlined all trading, cut obstacles for small goods, and recognized the digital and environmental changes of the 21st century.
These new tariffs throw all that away."
"The loss of American manufacturing has led to a significant increase in the income disparity between those with and without college degrees. Carefully structured, targeted tariffs on particular goods could incentivize companies to increase manufacturing capacity in the USA which would create more manufacturing jobs but not as many jobs as people think. Companies would still try to keep costs down by reducing the number of staff hours required to operate factories. AI did not exist 70 years ago during the American manufacturing boom. AI will allow factories to be much more automated than they have ever been. This means they won't actually create that many more jobs for people who don't have college degrees. You'll still need a post-secondary degree or higher to work in an automated factory. Tariffs are inflationary. They are literally designed to discourage the consumption of foreign made goods by making it harder for the companies importing them to compete with American made goods."
Worried about war while hiring the most unqualified sycophants to fill the nations most sensitive positionsGoofball University….
"Buy less, and by from home ground."
Tariff = Tax.
And how would high tariffs affect prices in the US?
Terrible product from 60 minutes what they failed to talk about is how increasing the production of energy in the United States is the way that we’re gonna drive prices down and allow US manufacturers to compete and produce their products at stable prices
Smart no cheap product is worth loosing
He is speeking the truth. It has nothing to do with anything but positivity for America. Has nothing to do with party
"DEAR DONALD. 
Please go ahead.
WE LOVE YOU "
This is similar thinking that was bandied around by the proponents of Brexit. Brexit categorically has failed. Utter chaos. Stagnation and inflation. Massive closure of small and mid sized businesses. The largest businesses moved abroad. It's foolish to leave this for CEOs to figure out. What a mess!
"Tariff: 
Triggers saving money. 
Do we really need what they sell? 
Society says we need thier products? 
Save your money, let the supply go up. 
It will lower prices again. ️"
60 minute is wrong again! Both Mexico and Canada now comply with Trump’s request.
The guest is living in some other world
You can tell he doesn't sleep well...
He is spot on!!!
"So, who is going to pay for the tariff Americans or the outside country?"
and we pay for the game they play…
Even if it costs us more we need things in the United States made here
"""Will these very highly paid CEOs figure out how to make a profit"".... oh boy. Repeat that a few times over."
"A bold trade policy should shock the system with immediate, high tariffs on key imports, creating a surge in tax revenue while gradually influencing inflation. By rapidly increasing tariffs, the government can generate significant funds to help balance the budget and reinvest in domestic industry, while businesses and consumers gradually adapt. This approach forces a shift toward local production, amplifying the multiplier effect as money stays within the economy, cycling through wages, reinvestment, and growth. While import prices will rise, inflationary impact will be delayed and manageable, giving time to develop domestic supply chains and strengthen industrial capacity. A high-tariff shock jumpstarts economic self-sufficiency, accelerates trade balance correction, and forces long-overdue market adjustments, positioning the nation for long-term stability and growth."
"Lighthizer disgusts me. He is 100% the worst of the Reagan era. Cut taxes, do nothing to improve the work force, massive military, cut government programs that help regular people. Seems like a total sociopath."
What's with the froggy-voice weirdos in this administration?
What about Amazon? Almost everything I get from Amazon is from China.
"I hope the people in Belvedere can hold out.  I don't know how agreements work with companies but there's a small EV start up called APTERA that needs an influx of capital to start hitting high production and if the local governments can somehow get $60 million together, maybe they can draw this American company to IL to help produce the vehicle.  It's an amazing vehicle with nothing on the road like it, but I feel can change the EV landscape here and abroad."
"It will hurt temporarily, but nothing happens overnight. More domestic  manufacturing as the cost of overseas goods cost increase and are less available. Im middle class business owner I pay health insurance for my folks, and the cost of goods sold is 18 percent higher. We need to do things differently, or  the next generation will not have any chance. Entry homeownership is between 200k and 300k. Ask yourself, especially if you have kids, what will it take for them to be prosperous."
"Meanwhile, over at Treasury..."
Not difficult people.  Stop sending profits to the top. Money freely moves profits out of communties.  Companies are financially incentivized to maximize profits for shareholders.  Why are workers and the communities not recipients of profits? Paychecks arent profit.
"My question is, if china is the threat, why are the tariffs lower for them"
"If China is the bigger threat, why only 10% tariffs? and the poorer country, Mexico 25% ?"
Why be so scrutinizing of tariffs? Trump doesn't care about taxing other countries (though they will bear some of the burden from tariffs). He wants companies here to stay and build here and he wants companies that sell the the US to move here.
Trump utterly lost the last trade war when he had to pay $60 billion and pay out to farmers
US companies in China are expanding rapidly. Starbucks open 2 to 3 new stores a day in China. Their economy is expanding faster than the US and most other countries. They want to import about $US two Trillion worth of goods this year. What a pity the US is wanting to limit the amount it sells to China.
"We're on the phone to much and no work is getting done, who made our phones."

"Because taxs are too high. Thats nothing is build here.   Who make the number one corn soybean, in the world yet no one buys from us.  Ding"
"Extremely risky and predicated on prior American economic independence. Like many have said, we're starting with hurting the closest relationship with our allies and that's not a viable long term strategy. I want America to thrive so badly once more but this seems like too blunt a tool and too short term in scope. Especially dealing with a rival like China."
Companies will figure it out. By absolving business incorporation in America and just go outside.
"What people are not understanding is that those countries have a one way advantage in trading when it should be and equal trade.  China, Mexico and Canada cannot sell their goods to their own citizens and make the same profits they make selling those goods to the USA.   Therefore those countries need the USA more than the USA needs them.  The closing statement is the best argument anyone can ever make... the current way has been failing for decades if something new isn't tried than we will continue to fail economically."

As an engineer I'm taking my knowledge and my money and going elsewhere. Going to a country who wants to work with other countries who wants the human race to succeed and cares about their citizens. The ones who are going to be left in this country will not have the skill set to build anything. The only thing that this is going to do is make the rich richer while the rest of us pay extra for basic needs.

"tariffs are supposed to be a temporary cost for a long term benefit. The idea that tariffs will bolster domestic industry and production and lead american consumers to buy domestic goods would be valid if WE ACTUALLY HAD DOMESTIC INDUSTRY, these companies have allready outsourced the vast majority of production and labor to foreign countries so in the end all this is going to do is lead americans to pay more for things they have to buy from foreign producers , because there are no american producers that produce them. domestic products will also go up as companies only care about profits, not empowering the american worker.  corporations got us into this muck by outsorucing everything, and we were complicit in it when we fell in love with cheap foreign goods and continued to consume with no thought or foresight into how this would lead to a long term decimation of the american economy"

There’s no way we (Americans) can produce something as cheaply as china. Unless you can find Americans willing to work for Chinese wages. Ain’t gonna happen.
"TWO big problems here.  1. Trump isn't talking about just targeting China or only applying limited tariffs on a specific sector that needs protected from foreign dumping.  He is talking about universal tariffs on all imports, even from our allies and countries that we have tried to boost economically as part of stopping illegal immigration.  2. It sickens me to hear this man who won't feel a bit of pain in his personal life from the disruption and high prices many of us will struggle with if he gets his way just shrug off the harm this will do to so many by saying we could just switch back in a decade if it doesn't work.

I suggest people read up on the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the early 20th century that led to the Great Depression. If he follows through on his plans, we could be looking at something very similar.

It's not that I completely disagree with the idea of relying less on China to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  But placing tariffs on ALL imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  INSTEAD of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from North, Central, and South America, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a US company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the U.S.  It would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  It would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the U.S. for work.    It would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the Panama Canal, because U.S. and Canadian imports from Mexico, C.A. and S.A. could come by train.  But Trump is the President now, so I guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve OUR (not just HIS) goals.  It would also ensure that those Central and S. American countries stay aligned with us instead of becoming more entwined with China.  Right now, it seems like Trump is pushing countries AWAY from us and TOWARDS closer economic and political ties with China"
What happened to Trump’s tariffs on Mexico and Canada?
Lots of tap-dancing around questions put to Lighthizer about the increase in prices for everything and the loss of jobs because people cannot afford to buy higher-costing products.
He wants a big military to enforce corporate profit policy. That means the kids of the lower and middle class dying for CEO salaries.
… I feel so sorry for the Americans who did NOT vote for this but will be impacted by the fall out none the less. You are trapped because of other people’s greed and stupidity!
"Not that simple, for example labor costs are lower in China."
"""One of the ways they figure it out is by laying people off."" "
You can't continue to pee in your own mouth for water and expect to survive!! Layoffs are happening currently.  In my time in the workforce over the last 20 years the last 3 years I've seen thousands of jobs outsourced out of the country which we have never seen before.
"60 Minutes should look at the bigger picture.  Our nation has to cut our expenses.  Illegal immigration is a really big expense.  Theses tariffs are meant to draw attention to that.  Also, we need to even our how we trade."
Then why China is tariffed only 10% yet US ally Canada gets hit with  25% ?
it’s not coming back from another country. my dads work with pension moved to a different country back in the 90’s.
"It reminds me his last policy during Covid. We should print more money and give it to everyone. He gained reputaion and left White House, but what we got.

Any college student could tell him printing more money and handing out for free was a really bad idea. I kept asking myself maybe he never went to school but he had a team behind, what happened to them? Now I see, they are simply all under educated."

Can the host simply ask him if he ever took econ class at school.
What will stop us from the EU...and me specifically as a tiny company...to buy from China instead of USA? If Trump decides to put tariffs on EU also? Because EU will undoubtedly put tariffs also. I am talking also about Canada and Mexico. Swiss Army knives are still 100% Swiss made. The most expensive country in the world. What gives? I think XI put out a party yesterday!
We trade more with Mexico than China by the way
"Greed and peace by strength is what got us in to this situation, peace by strength may sound good, but its an illusion and does not work, greed, well you  can blame that on big manufacturing companies and big profits, making enough profits wasn't enough, they wanted a lot more, and when a government runs a country like a business, it will always fail."
Trump playing whack a mole it's a losing proposition
Tariffs are a direct payment to the US Government which is to Trump and his cronies. The cost will then be added to the food and merchandise we buy.
"The claim she made about there being no competition after tariffs push Chinese ptoducts out is absolutely false. There are often multiple domestic competitors, as well as other (non-Chinese) foreign competitors."

Why is 60 minutes not on Sunday!
"This guy has never taken an economics course, cost accounting and supply chain management class.  He doesn’t understand things like comparative advantage and economies of scale."
"Isn’t it interesting that we have enabled China by shipping our manufacturing jobs and now we want them back. Policies matter a lot, because their impact is felt after 10 or 20 years later. Outsourcing helps companies quarterly or annual returns look good, ie stock price goes up, but they destroy middle class and the ability to compete and leads to trade deficits. We should focus on ‘making’ things in USA, rather than ‘manufacturing’ financial results"
200 is better than thousands
This is on 60 MIN. You have already lost my trust. No need to listen too.
from comedy actor to economist?
I think like this if Mr trump raise the tariffs with 25 percentage. Local businesses can profit by producing the same goods. Goods produced in USA can be cheaper by 25 % in comparison with goods coming from Canada
"....But If I chose not to get the item ""I will not pay the tariff/tax"" that Walmart chose to pass on to the consumer. Still like my odds with the idea that I have a choice in what I want. U.S. made or ""Made in China""...HMMM!"
Where is the other 47 minutes
"""I believe in tariffs as an economy measure"" is automatically disqualifying yourself from being an economist. if not you wanna ruin your own countries economy in this day and age. 
decoupling, ok that is a fair argument - but when you think 'slap on a tariff and it'be fine' ... well, nope."
"This guy has never taken an economics course, cost accounting and supply chain management class.  He doesn’t understand things like comparative advantage and economies of scale.  And this idea that we have been failing our way, yes, failing our way all to being the largest economy in the world."
I hope it works out
"If all we want to look at is cheaper goods, then why are we making anything here? There is no way a US manufacturer can compete with a Chinese or Mexican Manufacturer, it just can't. Labor costs are so much cheaper in those other countries. We need to stop always thinking cheaper and start thinking about the men and women who are losing their jobs. When jobs loses happen, what do we think these people are supposed to do to survive? First they will need assistance, that could be longer term. Then they stop spending because they don't have the extra money to spend. So tax money goes to help the people who have been laid off, plus the taxes those people were paying is gone. I can also assume some of those laid off can go through depression and other issues. Perhaps turning to drugs or alcohol to get through the day. Again that costs more taxes for rehab and also deaths. We have no choice but to stop thinking cheaper all the time and think about a neighbors and follow Americans."
"Tariffs on Chinese imports could encourage Apple to move it's phone manufacturing somewhere else - if not to the US then anywhere where the country is not stealing our techology, exporting drugs to the US or building a military to challenge US."
This guy is so arrogant. How much of the tax collected from these tariffs is trump going to skim off for his rich mates.
"they never answer teh obvious question. if tariffs are so bad then why does the EU and China have massive tariffs against us? we are the ONLY major country that does not have them, so again explain this. why don't all these terrible things happen anywhere else?"
America has been a middle guy in global economy. The world will cut them out unfortunately.
if china is the threat then why not put a 25% tariff on them too?
meanwhile china is getting all of our 5090's from the communist owner of nvidia.
60 minutes nope. Will never trust em if even they get it right 1 time out of 500.
"What they aren't factoring in is the cost to transport goods from overseas. I thought we cared about the environment? Why are we shipping basic goods from China that can be produced here? We also have a lot of red tape to build factories which should be improved with deregulation. Start up costs have to be improved. Then you have to factor in economies of scale. Prices would improve over time. Wages then increase over time. Once production in the US ramps up, we now how an eco friendly and competitive product, wages are higher, it's American made, quality products return and they could be cheaper in the long run via automation and economies of scale, with lesd transport costs. Depending on the product, this ramp up of production could happen relatively quickly."
Leave it to CEO's to figure it out?????
"The company didn’t invest , innovate , just kept taking the money out , the Chinese didn’t steal the tech you gave it to them , apple phones a great example,"

Who has 10 yrs to throw against the wall?
i would just do a vat tax on foreign goods same concept
They didn’t retaliate they Fold
Reading the comments show the ignorance of the audience for 60 minutes.
Getting rid of manufacturing jobs is the best thing we could do for this country. Why is the richest country on earth going to put our citizens through the dangers of working with heavy machinery in less than safe working conditions vs. let China do it and net all Americans with cheap goods that are basically a tax cut.
This guy is living in a long gone fantasy world.
"The thing I get is China's ""3:1"" trade... but gets a15% lower  Tariff  than Mexico and Canada? I mean get why Mexico would get a Tariff because China's circumventing the tariff through them. Canada doesn't makes sense."

"I’m amazed of how stupid Trump is. No longer is the US the only country with resources and best yet, the people are the biggest resource.  The US has genius in the country, but the blue collar workforce is lazy and not able to produce at the same rate as others around the world. The US feels entitled to be the best without the best resource, people. I work for a global company and there is no comparison for plants in MX, Brazil, India and China.  These companies have also built plants, supply chain and other resources where now they can bypass the US very easy, I know because I work for a such company in the automotive industry. These plants are out producing the US by millions and millions of dollars. Whose fault is this?  This is AMERICAN greed? Maybe not? Look at the average American who voted for Trump, these people could not go toe for toe with the rest of the world. So this is why American companies go to the rest of the world and yes it’s a third of the price to produce and sometimes less. I love the US, and I believe we all need each other and when you have dialogue you come up with great ideas and solutions. Not by trying to bully others. The American people will be the ones suffering the consequences."
This boat has sailed. Why should China not pull ahead if they manufacture more? Tariffs are a tax on Americans. Duh.

It is nice to try new things but in life, relationships matter as much as money that feeds you to survive."
"I'm not an economist, but it seems to me that this ""Lightwiser"" (pun intended) guy doesn't quite understand what he is talking about or is not able to comprehend the whole picture or both. If USA wants to attack China together with its allies by increasing tariffs on Chinese good, maybe it's not the best idea to FIRST implement tariffs on the goods produced by the said allies. Also his idea of how to achieve the world peace is very frightening one. As far as the tariffs themselves are concerned, from the point of regular Americans they will be like peeing in your pants in a freezing temperature - first it warms you up, but then it gets really cold. Trust me, I know, I'm from Finland."

If this is so then why are WE allowing a non sanctioned person in our most critical information!  I am talking about Trump letting Musk into our treasury access with money and information!! Even highly vetted people are allowed to access the information that Musk currently has!!
We spent the last 4 years listening to the democrats and media tell us that higher cost creates a thriving economy. Funny how things flipflop when they are no longer in control.
"That’s his answer go back in 10 years lol, so make the American people pay more, sounds just like trickle down economics "
This guy is just an idiot and we all will see how these tariffs effect negatively the ordinary Americans!
"We all have to wait and see, but if I was american I would move near the border of Canada or Mexico, you could always cross the border and get your stuff from them at a lower price."
Maybe stop looking at economics as a competition and realize that if you reach an equilibrium where China’s labor force no longer is a cheaper alternative then things balance out. Capitalist businesses will always seek to use the cheapest labor. As nations mature their labor force becomes more expensive. It’s the cycle. Eventually manufacturing will find its way to Africa and so on. The key is to keep evolving your workforce to meet different needs.
These country clubbers just playing with the economy like it’s another yacht. They don’t care how many of us suffer. They enjoy it.
"We will do what Chinese are doing, why criticize China as communist?"

"How many CEOs care about workers? They care about profits first, then everything else, or they aren’t capitalists. If profits are squeezed, they look for ways to cut costs,,  mostly automate, use lower priced materials, or lower wages. Automation may create some jobs, but most likely which don’t involve the skill set of those laid off.  Unless profits no longer matter, tariffs won’t benefit very many Americans. Those laid off will need to change locations, or carriers, or both."
If the Trade war does not dissappear then Manufacturing will move back to the US but Tesla Bots and Boston Dynamics Robots are cheaper then American Salaries.
"We need to care for nature, our land, our people. Every nation must do this. CEOs too often care for profits alone. They leave their neighbor out on the road in need. Starbucks wint even let you use their bathroom anymore. How is that caring for community? 

Other countries don’t do this. They care about their people, & they make better deals because they demand it. They love their people more. American companies must learn to love their employees & communities more. CEOs aren't being taken advantage of, they are taking advantage & worshiping profits & greed. 

Glad this employer will go back into business & keep the community employed. Every country must look out for its people, not just its CEOs. 

The difference now than a few decades ago is too many CEOs care about raking in money, more than keeping good people employed. It is noble to take less money & have less profits if the money is going into communities. In the past, most CEOs did not care so much about money & profits & more about people & keeping a standard of living."

go back? hows that german tariff going since the 80s
Blame Canada
Well time for US to fall on their own hubris....
As soon as i hear someone using the word existential i  know they are going to talk a load of sh*te.
Wow... is this real? does this guy knows what is saying? clearly NOT

I get what he is saying he is cutting out the middle part (you have to get the companies started and they have to be successful this will take time could be a long time) also he is cutting out the greed part alot of these companies are not dully staffed now to think they will be fully staffed just because all the products come from America is wishful thinking but i doubt it CEO or owners are not taking a pay cut period
"Mexico just caved and will send 10,000 troops to the border with the U.S. THIS IS THE POWER TRUMP WIELDS WITH THE THREAT OF TARIFFS!"
Says China like Trump
"Wait. What? American CEOs are going to have to figure out how to cover the cost of tariffs? But their whole thing--schlump and his cronies--is that Mexico, Canada and China will bear those costs. So, which is it Bob? Interesting that he was appointed by Reagan. We all know how Reagan's economic policy worked out for the middle class. Oh, it used to be that the average American family used to have at least one full-time employee in their family and even though there was just one main earner, most of those families could afford to pay their mortgages, buy school supplies and groceries, and buy the occasional car and take the occasional family vacation without having to sacrifice any regular stuff like medicine (they had health care back then). It was called the Middle Class. It was a pretty nifty thing for families until Ronald Reagan, yes, the actor, and, probably this buffoon here, Lighthizer, ideated that wealthy corporate owners could be given huge tax breaks to ""invest in their employees and business infrastructure"" and then pass the new financial windfalls they'd get and eventually got, down too the dedicated men and women who had those great, secure jobs that kept them in the Middle Class. They called it ""trickle down economics. It was sold as manna from heaven for the regular worker and family but turned out to be a bunch of wealthy dudes just shaking the p*ss from their d*cks all over us and calling it rain. Oh, it worked out so very well, didn't it?"

"Theories/idealism and what happens in real life are two different things. Adding tariffs causes a trade war in real life. Also, why are the tariffs on our allies and not China, then?"
60 minutes mad their usaid funding isn't coming in anymore hahahaha
This man is SICK
tariffs are a tax on a foreign country like for example if there's a tax on Huawei the importer pays the US government not china those taxes making Huawei more expensive and less competitive.  Its not as if china is receiving that money.
"Tariff's not goint to solve all the problems, not 10-25-50- or even 100% anyway. Maybe 300-500%... things like clothes and building materials, are still cheaper when manufactured outside America even at 100% tariff. Especially when the goods has labor cost is higher than the raw material cost. When an good that is sold at $100, where the labor is at $30, and material at $20, with $50 profit, but if you give it a 100% tax, it's now selling at $200 dollars, allowing you to take (in theory) $100 for every $30 paid to labor (in China or India) and for every $50 the manufacture profits... but still it's NOT going to bring those jobs back to United States, because the labor cost in USA would be at $150 to $300 just to make a $200-product, and the profitabiliy of something sold at $200 minus the labor $150 and material $20, would only be $30 profit, at 15% ($30/$200) profitability, it's not going to attract any business to move its base back into United States... 

Meanwhile, people who used to be able to buy stuff at $100, now would have to buy it at $200, or even at $300 for products made in USA... it would have a short-term pain for the average households, and a long term drop in trade. People who sells stuff at $100 to the United States, would now look for customers outside of United States selling at $100 to make up for the loss of revenue.

In the end, average consumers would either find cheaper tag price items at $50 for much inferior quality, or people could end-up buying from a trip to Mexico or Canada to buy item at 50% discount and bring them in as 'personal comsumption' to evade the import tax. If tariff is at 100%, demand for higher priced item would drop by 50%, and those who couldn't afford, would help jack up the price of much inferior item. Say if you used to buy natural cotton t-shirt at $20 a piece, which gives manufacture $10 for every t-shirt sold. Now it's selling at $40-dollar, and you'll end up buying a $20-dollar chemically-synthesized-fabric at cost of $2 where manufacturer would make $8 for every t-shirt sold, and the US government would take $10-dollar, allowing you to keep your cost down at $20 for t-shirt. the downside for you is that chemically-synthesized t-shirt would contain unhealthy substances and put a strain on US-health system, thereby increasing the insurance cost even further.

I'm not sure where the $10 dollar tax by government would go for every chemically-synthesized t-shirt sold at $20, but it's definitely not in the pockets of average consumers or health insurance of tax payers."
'The billionaires are gonna figure it out' lol! Sure

This is going to further drive a greater wedge in the wealth gap and create a recession which will put more money in the rorbber baron’s pockets.   This guy has the morality of a slaver
"Can we see something, Anything that helps us Right Now????? capping the credit card interest rate at 10% would help a lot right now, none of what Trump is doing is going to trickle down to us, he is a liar"
HA! the felon doesn't understand tariffs.... lololol
Highly paid CEO's. Outrageously paid CEO's is accurate.  Greed
We're doomed!
People can choose not to take fantail or any other drug for that matter.
These show still hates Trump..
12:30 is SPOT ON
This guy is crazy.
"I'm tempted to sent some money and a letter of apology to both the presidents of Mexico and Canada letting them know that not all of us Americans are blaming, lying & criticizing idiots like those who infest our federal government these days.  Its the least I can do since I am now being defrauded of my own money that our own government requires me to pay to them  (via tariffs) for boarder protection they are not doing as they demand Mexico and Canada do all that work for us."
Thank you Wall Street Journal for exposing the truth about these tariffs and tariffs in general. We need more common sense reporting on these new economic blunders that are blindly accepted by these naive fanatics of the dirty old limo looney.
The interviewee is a more-on.  The only thing that will happen is goods will skyrocket.
"Dont blame other, you and your US companies want the highest profit...your pension plan depend on it, your USD depend on it. Sound more like you want your cake and eat it too.  Sorry if you to blind to see it 2025 is not 1980.... Usa cant dictate on a whimp."
"He lists a ton of problems such as military and other issues, then pretends tariffs have some connection. Nothing he proposes solves the problems he talks about.
This is typical false framing from Republicans. His comments and claims make no more sense than the fantasies of trickle down: the purpose is to fool people."
Can anyone help me understand how one can pursue a tariff strategy and at the same time fight inflation? And second how <whales are being driven crazy by windmills> because it comes from the same person.
"I see no winning in this. I havent bought a lot of things I used to; I am very careful, and I believe others will follow suit. It will not help our economy at all. I believe we are in a world of hurt God help us"
Tariff is just a soft term to tax the ordinary people!..its the people who will bear the burden not companies..big companies built manufacturing plant in china/india not US..if their products getting 25% tariff it still worth it than to open manufacturing plant in US..good luck americans 
What trade war? I thought Mexico and Canada made an agreement?
"How about, instead of buying all that crap we buy from China, with their cheap labor, we built those factories in Central America! We still get the same cheap crap, but now it’s not shipped as far, Central America now has employment for their citizens, so they don’t have to migrant to the US!"
""" I dont think that's true"" (that we will lose workers) except it was true lol, this is not theory, it is fact!"
Just bought more XAI308K after your guys video. I knew i wasnt crazy to see elon musk created a new crypto coin.
"Pointing at others, point your forehead."
"If Trump is actually doing actual illegal things, (and I think he is) why are we not therefore hearing about impeachment?  I know it's early, but can we really allow all these shenanigans to continue?  Trump has got to go."
"Just listen to this guy  he’s basically saying we must be the #1 army we must be #1 in everything  that is equally to say we need to put our foot in everyone’s toes  if we can’t be #1 we are not happy  don’t they need to worry about the quality of life of us citizens instead? How do we become more competitive without the need of pointing a gun into countries that are doing really good, how do we lower the cost of producing in America? Those questions are obviously unanswered because this people don’t have the capacity to think like that."

"In other words, because of this radical and Trump believing what he says, we are living this terrible mistake."
wait & C for Trump this is the best chois for USA now
"At the End, 13:30, he never said tariffs was right!!!! GREAT DEPRESSION 2025 TO 2030."
This is a total BS report!!! Lots of opinions and a lot of robots!!!
"No you will not see more jobs domestically, because the CEO's know that it is smarter and financially more lucrative for their business adn themselves to look for cheper labor than trying to make the new more expensive options work..
Humans always aim for the path of least resistance.
Companies are no different because guess what, humans are what runs the companies..."
Does not surprise me at all. It is probably a back-handed wild card strategy of Trump all along. Just business haggling.
This guy is freaking 
"Ah! that makes sense. This is just a decade long economics exeriment with a big n. Ingenius, indeed."
"This guy under Reagan admin says it all, the working class tax payers will be squeezed again, and I’m not big on having a foreign billionaire in charge of what’s good for American tax dollars but time will tell"
"Trade Chief apparently don't have good answers to problems, just try?"
sorry not sorry but he may be educated but he has no sense of what he is talking about
I believe the experts before I believe KIng-Trump.
"If it is too expensive i wont be forced to buy crap from china, i can buy for same price but alot better quality , i am ok paying more."
NAFTA sent jobs across borders on the cheap.
What is this guys educational background
"The interviewer is a dinosaur,the interviewee a Trump sycophant."
"When he started talking about it war and how you win, he's obviously an economist and not a military mind. So many larger armies have lost to smaller armies because of strategy and not numbers. If the world turns on us, we're fkd. Since Trump is turning on our allies it's bound to happen."

Can we discuss Trump’s threat to our way of life?

"This guy Lighthizer is full of sh*t.  Plain and simple.  This is trickle-down, supply-side, voodoo-economics...it always comes walking around with a different name, but playing the same game.  Heads, I win. Tails, you lose."
THE WHOLE WORLD TALKING ABOUT XAI308K.. Did elon musk really make a new crypto or what?
"He can be an expert in trade which I also doubt- but he is dead wrong on China's wanting to be a hegemon and maybe first in the world!
With that size, China is naturally a heavy weight, made that way with the help of western investments.  The West just did a lousy math job calculating that China would not surpass the West, hence the panic!
The million dollar question: can the country educate its work force and have an environment conducive towards more local investments and a bigger workforce?
Japan and other asian countries got ahead because their workforce had the skills to make good, affordable products!  Clear example of that is Taiwan, where TSMC make high end chips with western technology,  Their workers have something US workers can not provide.  Even well established US companies like Boeing are having trouble finding skilled workers!"
he's using a laptop made in China
What is wrong with his voice and eyes. He's lying.
"This guy is full of $hit, blaming others for our own Governments wrong doings and mistakes"
Did he say allies ?
Very few drugs are coming from Canada..
stealing job... there are 1 million farm jobs At this moment... when are they going ot get filled?   not any time soon
"surly a slight decrease in the value of the dollar will be a better solution.  makes USA products / labour more compedative and foreign good s more expensive. I suppose the wealthy wont like it. banks wont like it, as foreign loans would get cheaper to service . either way goods will get more expensive ."

This guy is sick and needs help
This guy is a LITE WEIGHT.   Close to a FOOL.  Lol. 
"More jobs? Robert, really?"
Will Trump really grow our Navy this time? Last time Trump said he would greatly increase the size of our Navy. Instead we got just 1 more Navy Ship in the 5 year budget than we had at the end of Obama's term. Admittedly----Congress controls the purse strings----and may not let us grow the Navy. I have no clue----but hope Trump pushes his congress for more ships this time.
06:24 what allies?
"So you shape things by controlling what you and I buy here. Soon, that would cause us to choose cheapest? And consume far less. Less profit will wake leaders in other economies up. Workers will take a hit but without leverage the economy and prices will not move needles."
PS these people are always wrong get paid big money and always always wrong.
7:12 his lying in front of everyone.
"Here is the problem 89 % manufacture are used to be in the United States left the country, China, Mexico, Asia, all factory build on American money they make them rich"
He lost his voice
"But why are you putting tariffs on your allies if we are to decuple from China? Surley the best policy is to integrate the western economies more, not less? If all the western countrys work as one we are like well over 1 billion people with a scope from north america, europe, and asia, and australia and new zeeland. Swedish citizen."
This gay did finish the statement. When a CEO looks at last quarter earnings and see that there was lost “year-over-year” they are then looking at by the board members and stockholders; how are we going to get our money to profit. If the quarterly profit doesn’t go up then they will find another CEO that is willing to do what it takes to make a profit. That is where the workers will lose their job when the job goes to Mexico or Canada. The bottom line is the company MUST make a profit so the workers can get paid.
"Well, ya get what you vote for so when all y'all Trumpeters are upset that you're paying more just now you did it to yourself and to all of us!"
"chinese advancement is real. the latest shock was that they replicated the reasoning model openAI o1 with 1/10th of its computational cost. lowering all future openAI earnings, that's a bit too much."
Mr..economic expert.... you are leaving out that the American economu can start producing those products competitively. And the dus erning american citizen will buy American. The one worlders like 60 minutes always leave essential parts of the argument out.
XAI308K 35  or 3500 ?
for me it's a bit like when McDonald's employees wanted more money McDonald's eventually gave them more money but what happened to the end user we all paid more money for the hamburger which is basically the same things going to happen if I order a set of wheels that come from China that were $400 now with a tariffs they're not going to be $400 they're going to be 700 they're going to transfer the Tariff to the end user
Who is ‘we’.

"So when biden does tarrifs it helps, but trump tarrifs hurt. Got it."
"I can get onboard with tarrifs. But congress would need to pass massive funding and subsidies for stuff like steel. We would need to create and modernize many factories and incentivize young men graduating from HS to go into steel manufacturing. I don't see how this goes well or becomes a good thing without that starting to happen and becoming law in 2025 at the latest. Republicans can easily gain democratic votes and support on this issue and in general if their economic protection regime was a properly implemented patriotic program. Same with the birthing stuff. Ok, you want babies, actually deliver on the state sponsored pro-natal programs that they like to go on about."
7:46 wall mart is china amazon is china agents of china they are not american... again  agents of china
What a joke
Thank you for this insite! Everywhere online or YouTube it's no help people who support are like stop crying others are like it's completely wrong but I get it now.
"this didn't age well lol, canada and mexico CAVED!!!!"
When the US has lost the manufacturing capacity and can't  match that of China and other small countries imagine the situation prices will skyrocket and there will be nothing to buy even when u hv a ton of money! First you have to  bring back your industrial base and infrastructure   all over the country! The US let China join WTO and now 
Is this guy dumb? Or is he just a mouth piece for this administration?
"I love all these eccomics people  trying g to tell us a tarifs  is not a tax. It makes people  move production locally  to avoid the tarifs  and helps employ  our people.  End of the day these so called people  talking down tarifs  are people  getting deathly off china of paid by ones who are. 

When you see a sign buy locally is that a bad sign? Should we rip them down? This is same idea"
"when it comes to money, the chinese are master at it."
Just another dumb idea by Trump.  He doesn't know anything about trade.
"If income taxes are less or better yet obsolete but the price of goods is higher will not the addnl tariffs paid on the goods purchased then be paid by both citizens and noncitizens?  By both tax payers and non income tax filers?  
This applies to both US citizens & non citizens.  Some illegal migrants pay  income taxes but some do not. But some US citizens also don’t pay income taxes."
Wow - so many other countries citizens are chiming in to try to panic America - imagine that.  And Media here to goat  them along.  The usual scenario. Come on America - see through the smoke & mirrors.
This guys a joke
The tariffs are going to hurt small business mostly Republicans which rely on imports more than the large companies who can absorb the costs which will transfer more wealth to them and increase their control over sectors of the economy. It's the gilded age 2.0 being implemented by DOGEs 20225 plan.
"If the prize from china is high, we buy from american goods produce in america!"
"Great, Clear Speech!! Appreciated!! Also, how much of your paychecks are you giving to God???"
folks you sounding like the musicians on the Titanic !  Enjoy the music with Ice !  Way too late - BRICS  ship sailed past long ago !
60 minutes lost 10 billion dollar suit  by Trump because they were trying to elect this mediocre Kamala .

Please dont push this 60min to me. This show is evil
Such a stupid guy! US Industries dont exist an the rest is far away to bee competitif.
It's going to be painful to do it but it has to be done do we do it ourselves or let our kids do it when they grow up and don't have any money because there's no jobs because we're not making anything at all somehow we have to make stuff in this country it might hurt to get there but it will be worth it because people have money again and there will be jobs
The genius of America?  China is way way clear....have you seen China's EV industry?

HEB BABY
Comment number one tariffs are a tax on the people and there is no doubt about that. Comment number two on the initial point of the trade difference and deficit between us and China. How do we expect that to go down when China because of us and our greed in the late '70s early '80s decided to give them the title of world production factory. We did this because they offered to build anything we want for cheaper price and of course the geniuses very unpatriotic business owners said yeah sure let's go there We can make more money. So we did So how on earth do we expect to not produce much they produce everything and to have some kind of balance between trade. The only reason that there is even that one to three whatever it's called difference is because of negotiations in agreements to force them to buy a certain amount from us. Truthfully if that agreement was not there they wouldn't buy a damn thing from us because they can make it and they can also make it for less money like they do for the rest of the world.
i don't believe anything or anyone connected to orange jesus!

Trump gets into office and overnight were all poorer
This is an insance era introcuced by many idoits
He’s. Dreaming
"Here is the math: “I am the second coming!” People believed and voted. New God feels invincible. God destroys to rebuild. People realize their God is not invincible and will make everyone suffer (except his wealthy friends and family) soon companies will have to let go of many employees to be able to stay in business. Many laborers will be forced into encampments or be deported. Those legally able to work will not work for cheap wages. No jobs, no employees will result in a dominoes effect. By 2028 Republicans will still blame China, Immigrants and the Democrats (with many many billions if not trillions in their pockets) the end. (Hey, but MAGA, right? )"

"watch this guy last  night....Not very bright with common sense and logic...
just another GOP mouth piece...."
"Tarrifs have a back-end benefit that is not mentioned here.  Tarrifs make American made products less expensive, realitive to an import. So, yes, a person might pay more at Walmart for a product.  But the theory is that the person who pays more at Walmart will pay lower taxes because his next-door neighbor now has a job making the thing he buys at Walmart.  His neighbor now has a job that was formerly in China, and he pays taxes, so the rest of us pay lower taxes."

this guy basicly blame other because he have weak defense.. definitely a loser character..
"Simple! 🇺🇸 is not competitive, and resources move to areas where they can be used in the most efficient and effective ways to generate wealth. So  🇺🇸 needs to become competitive as its spending power is declining due to other countries having a competitive advantage in certain sectors.  As the rest of the  per capita  income increases  🇺🇸 will become increasingly irrelevant as a leading market for products and so tariffs will not work. The  through globalisation is more integrated than before. No country produces all the raw materials required for its industries. Hence, there must be collaboration. The America first policy is doomed to fail. 🇺🇸 problems can only be solved through creativity, innovation , trade, and collaboration. Capitalism, as well as neo political culturalism, must be reviewed to be relevant for this century. If that is not done, then it will continue to lead to more frustration, disillusionment, conflict, and the coming into power of despots who are incapable of stemming the tide. The  is in transition, and  how we facilitate this transition will determine our survival. We all need to play our part for our prosperity and, ultimately, our survival."

I am a Nova Scotian in Canada and this tariff is the biggest slap in the face. I supported Trump policies during the election causing stress on many of my relationships. Canadians have fought and died along side Americans. We brought back US hostages from Iran and helped like no one else during 911. In addition Trump said all we had to do was secure our border and stop fentanyl. We acquiesced and announced 2 billion to address the border and instead of saying thank you Canada for doing this. He says, too bad we‚Äôre still gonna tariff you anyway. Well if I was the Canadian Prime Minister, I‚Äôd say to hell with it we‚Äôre gonna cancel the $2 billion and let the drugs and criminals flow across the border and the heck with you. It hurts me to say this because I was a huge Trump supporter and I love much of what he does but to treat your best friend and neighbor like we were Kenya or Cuba is a slap in the face. We hate Trudeau, but we will galvanize to boycott anything coming from the US and tariff the shit out of them.I would hate to have a US license plate Coming through anywhere in Canada this week. If anybody thinks we need their tourism visits, They can stay the hell home this summer. We have enough minerals and resources under our ground that we don‚Äôt need to bend a knee to anybody. We try to be nice, responsible, and think of everyone in our business dealings, but we will not be walked on and have our children‚Äôs faces slapped.

Do people understand that tariffs only hurt already struggling U.S. citizens?  Tariffs do nothing to punish the countries importing goods.  Which means... we, the consumers pay the punishment money, our prices go up, not the importers.  We get a lot of food from Mexico. I thought these supposed ""leaders"" were good businessmen... pfffft, this is bad business. It's like a tantrum.

Trump makes America more isolated country into his period as Preident surely.  China will get more and better economic & more export to EU cause of  Trump¬¥s trade war.   EU-contries are preparing for Trump¬¥s tariff. Finally America by Trump will loose more.  Best Wishes from Sweden

As an American, I support Canada and Mexico unconditionally.  Retaliation is the only option to stop a bully.  Canada should stop all energy trade and Mexico needs to stop all supply chains into and out of the US.  It will be painful but it needs to be done.  Any renegotiation of a trade agreement between our countries will be to their detriment.

Canada should become less reliant on US as a trading partner. If it hurts the economy that bad it should never have been allowed to happen in the first place. Trump is tough but smart and understands the economy. Things will get better for both countries as they learn to rely on their own products which in turn will strengthen the economy. Stupid people do not become billionaires.

THE STORY ON TARIFFS
>According to recent reports it has been stated that the export volume to the United States of petroleum crude is expected to double over the next several years. That is a significant number. So, even if this figure does not double, any important increase in this export volume together with a high tariff wall, will hit the everyday American hard and American businesses, too. 
>No country consumes as much oil as the United States, and Canada ranks in the top four in the world with its resource of confirmed oil reserves. The United States consumes more oil per day than the combined total of the next three countries, China, India and Japan. There is no more secure source of this vital resource than in the province of Alberta, Canada. 
>American refineries, as this writer understands the technology, were designed specifically to refine the type of crude that comes from Canada. The volume of crude coming from Canada into the United States is over four million barrels per day and this represents twenty to twenty-five percent, roughly, of the daily consumption rate in the US which is itself over twenty million barrels per day! Any tariffs by the Trump administration will hit hard and will hit immediately. 
>With regard to potash, Canada has a huge resource of this commodity. This potash is a secure source unlike some of the other sources. Canada produces 16 million tons per year, which is more than Russia, China and Belarus combined. So, where would the US prefer to source its potash? Add this to the enormous export of crude to the US and one can see how this imposition of a tariff would have a serious impact on the US everyday citizens, and especially in the agricultural sector. Commentators in the US present the notion that the US can absorb the tariffs on these exports to the US; however, every time an American citizen goes to the gas station or goes to the grocery store, they will see the true cost of these two tariffs immediately.
>Now, we have had trade disputes before between Canada and the US, but these were resolved through negotiations. All that crude being shipped to the US each day is heavily discounted. When analyzing the trade in crude it could very well be that Canada is 'subsidizing' the US. We here in North America had better start looking at the big picture, and the world, as it is changing. Now is not the time to be threatening friends and allies.

The truth is that since Canada has 41.5 million citizens and the U.S. has 346.5 million citizens, the ""Hurt"" is going to be a LOT worse for Canada. I can do @ $800.00 dollars more a year, especially since this will cut taxes and most likely put me in the plus column. I don't agree with the tariffs but if it's for the good of the U.S. I'm OK with President Trump doing what needs to be done to make America great again.

Just a note to people of the USA. What happens to the USA if Canada decides to completely cut off electricity/oil and rare earth metals to them?. Are they going to be building new hydro electric dams/mines/oil pipelines in the next year or five? because they cost HUGE money and take a very long time to build, and guess where all that money is coming from. There's a big reason why the USA is buying from Canada/Mexico and China, it's because they need them, because they can't supply themselves with the amounts of things they need. Canada, Mexico and China can and will (in quick time now) find other/new customers. While it may be painful in the short term it WILL BE happening, but what about the US?. They've effectively alienated and isolated themselves from most of the free world that were willing to supply/deal with them now, and in the future. Canada is the second largest country on earth with a small population but HUGE amounts of oil/water/electricity and rare earth minerals which most believe is the true reason Trump wants them to become the ""51st State"". The problem is, much of the USA's ""common folk"" don't understand how tariffs work. I believe this is going to be bad for everyone concerned ""the little people"", but more so for the US in the long term. The countries (their populations, which control the vote of their leaders) that they once relied on to supply them, will now be turning against them because they no longer trust them and will be be VERY reluctant about dealing with them in the future because of this after Trumps gone. If I understand American Politics correctly, your Presidents can only serve two terms and this is Trumps second, and last kick at the can. 

Best for the people of the USA to be looking a bit further down the road they're on. There's a reason why Trump said he loves ""the poorly educated"" in 2016.

In the short-term, this is going to hurt both American and tariff hit country consumers. However, if the USA is going to send the world into recession with a trade war, we are going to look back at more recent times when the USA plunged the world into recession and the world this time around, just might realise that the less dealings it has with that country the better. I'm sure that everyone remembers the 'sub-prime loans' and the subsequent collapse of the financial industry and how it affected the global economy. All because of American greed and irresponsibility. How many more times are we going to allow this clown of a country to pull us down? The Trump Tariffs are an excellent opportunity to collaborate and cooperate more with each other and send Trump and his goons a clear message, but not only them but any future American leader with similar delusions of grandeur. I very much hope that the BRICS countries will follow through with their dispensing of the US dollar as the main currency. The UK and the EU should immediately commence talks with Canada to purchase their oil and have Canada divert a high percentage that is currently sold to the USA to Europe.

I'll give you an example of why you'll pay 10% more for every product in a year. We humans are stupid when we let a businessman be a politician. 25 percent tariff?? In a year, you'll pay 10% more for every product.For example, let's take a washing machine, an American washing machine, a European washing machine, now each one is $2,000. After a 25% tariff, a European washing machine is $2,500. The difference is $500. What will the American washing machine manufacturer think?? If I raise the price of my washing machine by 3 percent, they will still buy mine. In three months, I will raise the price of my washing machine again by 6 percent. In the next three months, I will raise the price of my washing machine by another one percent. The difference will only be 15 percent between the prices of American washing machines and European washing machines. And this happens with every single  statement will be easy to prove if you see a product that comes from Europe and the same product is made in America. Will there be a 25 percent difference between the prices of the two products? If there is no 25 percent difference, then I was right.this policy is called hidden taxation,
which shouldn't be called a tax.
and the american people ate it up.only business circles benefit from this tariff policy and not people...just watch the price movements..

Canada has a 180 billion dollar trade annual imbalance.  This is not fair trade and Americans are tired of being taken advantage of. During the Cold War, the US accepted this as part of a larger strategy, in order to counter the Warsaw Pact . Those days are long gone.  Canada needs to increase usa purchases, stop illegal border crossing, stop fentanyl precursor trafficking, build subsidiaries in the USA, increase nato spending to 5% of gdp for a decade.

Higher Prices for Consumers
 ‚Ä¢ Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, leading to inflation.
 ‚Ä¢ Consumers pay more for products that were previously cheaper due to global competition.
 ‚Ä¢ Example 3: In the UK, Brexit-related trade barriers led to rising costs for many imported goods.

I think the tariff on oil may actually only negatively affect US consumers. Based on some guesswork but more than likely correct imo. 
1) I assume that US refineries would have long term offtake agreements with the oil producers.
2) these contracts will be priced in $US/bbl. with the price based on international marker crudes 
3) excise duties (tariffs), pipeline charges etc. will be payable by the importer.
Under the above scenario, the exporter (Canada) is going to get the same amount in $US after the tariff as they did before but the importer will pay more for each bbl.
There is not much wriggle room for the importer as they need heavy crude which Canada is supplying and they probably don't have the infrastructure to import another heavy crude from elsewhere in the world. Similarly the exporter probably cannot pivot to selling their crude into another market due to lack of infrastructure. Given long enough both parties could develop the necessary infrastructure. 
It gets better for the exporter because the US dollar has formed (it always does in times of uncertainty) and the Canadian dollar has dropped significantly. So their revenue when converted to Canadian dollars has increased but their costs have remained the same.

So wait. The importer of the goods is the one who ultimately pays the tariffs.

So in essence, trump made it harder for American businesses and consumers and in retaliation, Canada and Mexico essentially said ‚Äú oh yea? Well now we‚Äôre gonna make things harder for our own people too!‚Äù

Canada wanted to know why they were getting a hire tariff than China.  The answer is that China already has tariff do the 10 is being added to that number.  Yes tarriffs might hurt US in the short term but it will hit Canada and Mexico worse in the long tun as there is massive deregulation being implemented into the US simultaneously.

WHY I'M BOYCOTTING AMERICAN PRODUCTS - BUT STILL WATCHING THE SUPER BOWL IN MEXICO - I‚Äôve made a decision to boycott all American products in response to the U.S. government‚Äôs unilateral and unprovoked economic attack on Mexico and Canada. This is my way of taking a stand against policies that hurt our neighbors and partners.
But some have asked: What about the Super Bowl?

Here‚Äôs my stance: I will watch the game, but I will do so at a local Mexican-owned bar in Playa del Carmen, where my money directly benefits hardworking Mexican people‚ÄîNOT American corporations. The bar owner, servers, and cooks are not responsible for U.S. government actions, and they don‚Äôt deserve to be caught in the crossfire of a boycott.

To stay true to my commitment:

 I will not buy American-branded products‚Äîonly local or non-U.S. options.
 I will use this moment to spread awareness and encourage discussion.
 I may donate an equal amount to a cause that fights economic injustice in Mexico and Canada.

Boycotts are personal choices, and I respect that others may see things differently. But I encourage everyone to think critically about where their money goes and what kind of world they want to support.

It is highly likely that Trump will remove tariffs once Trudeau is out of office, as his disdain for the current Prime Minister has been evident.

Apparently there is a 30 day freeze on the implementation of the tariffs. But Canada, Mexico and China should be looking for other markets in any case for their products.  If  USA wants to isolate itself, let it be isolated - like China under Mao and Albania under Hoxha. One difficulty is that Europe and China do not have good competing products for Google, Apple, etc. Tiktok is not really a competitor for YouTube, since it specialises in ""shorts"".  As for Facebook, I personally wouldn't care if it disappeared tomorrow.

To build a fairer and more humane future for immigrants in the United States, we need a comprehensive approach that includes legal reforms, respect for human rights, investment in home countries, cultural change within the U.S., and greater international cooperation. Here are some key solutions:

 A Fair and Accessible Immigration Reform
The immigration system should be clearer and more humane, providing a real path to citizenship for those who have already built their lives in the U.S. It‚Äôs also crucial to offer more legal work and residency opportunities to reduce irregular immigration, while ensuring border security without separating families.

 Protecting Immigrants‚Äô Rights
No matter where you come from or your immigration status‚Äîeveryone deserves to be treated with dignity. It‚Äôs essential to eliminate discrimination, guarantee access to education, healthcare, and housing, and oversee immigration agencies to prevent abuses.

 Supporting Home Countries
Many people migrate out of necessity, not choice. If the U.S. invests in the development of home countries‚Äîcreating jobs, education, and stability‚Äîfewer people will be forced to leave their homes in search of better opportunities.

 A Cultural and Political Shift in the U.S.
To ensure immigrants are valued, society must be educated about their positive contributions. This means launching awareness campaigns, encouraging community integration, and supporting leaders who advocate for social justice.

 International Cooperation for a Better Future
The immigration issue is not just a U.S. problem‚Äîit‚Äôs global. Countries must work together to create solutions that benefit everyone, protect migrants' rights, and promote safe and orderly migration.

 Conclusion
If we act with humanity and commitment, we can transform the immigration system into one that is fair and equitable. Immigration is not a threat‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to strengthen society and the economy. It‚Äôs time to recognize the value of every person, no matter where they come from.

Trump Tariffs will lower food prices for Canadians but raise them for the USA. Canada pork, beef, chicken and grain products will no longer be able to compete with USA suppliers so their only market will be Canada. This should drive down the Canadian price of meat and grain products (including bread and cereals). In addition, Canada's greenhouse produce should be much cheaper. So when Canada's food prices start rise blame Trudeau's misguided counter tariffs on American farm produce. 

What we can all expect is that unemployment in the private sector will rise to 20%, our economy will contract into a depression as Canadian manufacturers permanently go out of business, and Justin and Dougie (two peas in a pod) will borrow $200+ billion to pay people to stay home from work and corporate welfare. That same amount of money spent on procurement of equipment for our military, border security, and national anti-drug policing would make Canada and the USA safer, it would convince the Americans that were serious about border security, it would bring our military spending to 2% of GDP immediately and create high paid jobs in the USA and Canada to show that were serious about our international and national defense commitments.

Well the case in point is how to manoeuver the political landscape of cooperation for the common good at times of such a protracted multi-polarism or emerging new world order where thinking out of the box is inevitable and outweighing the business as usual way of thinking. Trump is in a good shape and America is in a good hand to pro-actively engage in probable happenings and respond to challenging changes that affect the western hemisphere. Yet, no need for provocative measures. There are a lot more agenda that bring both United States and Canada together. Canada is so vital to the United States and the other way round. Let's have a second thought to divert challenges into opportunities and make inclusive Mexico and China too

Btw, If claim is that middle class will pay, it will increase corporate profits that increases mrkt cap feeds into 401K. This is not even considering treasury will pay back Debt reducing interest payment that is a Trillion dollars in budget....biggest line item. 
""Are a record $1.2 trillion interest payments blowing up the federal budget?
The key is the yearly interest payments, which the U.S. Treasury Department's October report estimated will hit a record $1.2 trillion for fiscal year 2025, which ends next Sept. 30. The Federal Reserve Board's Nov. 7 interest-rate cut by one-quarter percentage point could reduce that somewhat.""

I hate this guy. Everything about him. But to make a fair point: Trump used economic leverage to incentivize Mexico to take more responsibility for its own border, which is like a sieve. He is right about that. He didnt back down with Mexico, he is giving them tone to make good on the commitment of 10,000 Mexican National Guards to be added to border security. Thats called a victory. It's rhe only smart thing he has done, so it should be pretty obvious. Spinning it as him ""backing down""...That really is fake news. We don't beat propaganda with propaganda. I'm so disappointed in how compartmentalized people have become. Everything is gaslighting now. Grow up.

Canadians have fought and died along side Americans. We brought back US hostages from Iran and helped like no one else during 911. In addition Trump said all we had to do was secure our border and stop fentanyl. We acquiesced and announced 2 billion to address the border and instead of saying thank you Canada for doing this. He says, too bad we‚Äôre still gonna tariff you anyway. Well if I was the Canadian Prime Minister, I‚Äôd say to hell with it we‚Äôre gonna cancel the $2 billion and let the drugs and criminals flow across the border and the heck with you. It hurts me to say this because I was a huge Trump supporter and I love much of what he does but to treat your best friend and neighbor like we were Kenya or Cuba is a slap in the face. We hate Trudeau, but we will galvanize to boycott anything coming from the US and tariff the shit out of them.I would hate to have a US license plate Coming through anywhere in Canada this week. If anybody thinks we need their tourism visits, They can stay the hell home this summer. We have enough minerals and resources under our ground that we don‚Äôt need to bend a knee to anybody.

52,Tariffying 
53,Nothing to do with drugs or immigrants of course. So lame.
54,"Trump is really being stupid with this one, as if Canada can stop drug dealers from selling. How about deal with the root cause of why people buy drugs.  If there was no demand there would be no supply. As an American I will say this makes no sense."
55,Not the casino bankrupting guy.

60,"Do people understand that tariffs only hurt already struggling U.S. citizens?  Tariffs do nothing to punish the countries importing goods.  Which means... we, the consumers pay the punishment money, our prices go up, not the importers.  We get a lot of food from Mexico.

68,"I'm American but I fully support Canada, China and Mexico to defend their countries and stand up against Trump's bullying and stupidity."
69,Historical example 1: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930) in the U.S. worsened the Great Depression by reducing international trade.
70,The poetic justice of the fact that by far the most consequences of this will suffer the exact people who voted for Trump.
71,Kudos to Canada and Mexico for fighting back for their people 
72,"Trump: ""The word tariff is one of the most misunderstood words. Nobody misunderstands the word tariff as much as I do."""
73,The guy who bankrupted 2-3 casinos will fix the economy 
74,Don‚Äôt look at me. I didn‚Äôt vote for the felon
75,Canada stands strong and free üá®üá¶
76,No one has ever accused an American to be too Self-Aware...
77,Mexico already struck a deal with Trump 
78,"Can you imagine if USA supplied Canada with electricity. He would have shut our lights off a week ago. To bad for him, Canada's finger is on the switch "
79,Have all Americans already forgotten what happened to American farmers last time Trump imposed a tariff on China!?
80,"Well done CANADA, glad you won't be dictated too "
81,"Why is the answer from Canada not to increase border security, work with the us to prevent fentanyl from entering the United States ?"
82,The imposition of tariffs will affect inflation due to the appreciation of imported products.
83,Canada needs to cut off the power supply right before the Super Bowl. That‚Äôll really hit home 
84,"I just think Canada and Mexico should become best buddies and stop trading with the US as much as possible... And also start trading more with other countries instead. I'm from the UK, but I have a bunch of Mexican and Canadian friends, so I'll quite happily boycott American products."
85,"When you treat someone like an enemy, they become an enemy."
86,"It seems like he is  worse than he was back in 2016, yet he holds even more authority. Gone are the days when he had General Kelly, Mike Pence and  seasoned politicians to guide him. Currently, he‚Äôs surrounded by idiots and that‚Äôs quite concerning."
87,THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU VOTE FOR A DOPE!!!
88,Probably going to be an insane amount of insiders on $Qardun Token
89,Canadian here! Trump says that Canada is basically being punished because of all the illegal immigrants and fentanyl coming from Canada into the US. WRONG!!!!  Less that 1% of fentanyl (which is actually equivalent to 48 pounds has crossed from Canada into the US get this - ONE TIME!) As far as illegal immigrants crossing - also less than 1%.
90,Grandpa Trump is an absolute old fool
91,"The thing with tariffs.. they are used to negotiate trade BUT if the other side retaliates, you‚Äôve already lost. This is exactly why anyone who has taken an economics class from a decent school knows objectively, they do not work."
92,"Canadian here and I am sick of Trump and his ignorance. I am boycotting US goods, especially goods from red states. I stand with the Americans who voted for Harris."
93,All the Americans who hate tax cuts should be overjoyed with these new tariffs.
94,"And now the hurt, for the average American starts. Get used to higher bills and a lower value dollar."
95,Mad dog is fast becoming Putin.
96,"Didnt trump promise lower prices? 

Wonder how trumpist will justify this move."
97,Example 2: The U.S.-China trade war (2018-2020) led to increased costs for businesses and consumers in both nations.
98,"You can't fix stupid, but sometimes stupid fixes itself."
99,The world  must stand up against this bully and find a way of co operating together and simply ignore anything about America. It could be done. Personally from now on I simply won't buy anything from America! And tesla. Play him at his own game!!!
100,So he‚Äôs using tariffs to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù these countries 
101,and this is why BRICS is important.
102,TRUMP - MAKING AMERICA POORER AGAIN SINCE 2016 üá∫üá∏ 
103,Trump ruining the country in less than 2 weeks is impressive
104,He will already drive up the prices for American consumers. You get what you vote for.
105,Trump will rename McDonalds to just Donalds. He did work a single shift there.
106,Canada should join BRICS.
107,Qardun Token yet has to really hit mainstream media guys
108,"He won't make America to be stronger,this is a big mistake ever happened in American history,local Americans will pay heavy price,because everything will go up "
109,"Canada is already part of America. Mexico is part of America too. In fact, Panama is also part of America already too!!! America is the name of our CONTINENT.
Are you perpetuating geographical IGNORANCE also? United States is not all of America!"
110,As a USA citizen I SAY DO NOT BOW DOWN TO THE ORANGE CLOWN
111,"We export terawatt-hours of electricity to the US. We should curtail that immediately. ""Oh, what's that? You can't produce enough electricity on your own? So sad, too bad."""
112,"This is not about fentanyl, this is about raising taxes to fund tax cuts to the very rich.  The chaos and suffering gives Trump immense pleasure."
113,"Well this will make it possible for Europe to drop imports of oil and gass  from Russland and the US and replace it with Canadian oil and gass ‚Ä¶a win win for both Canada and Europe, I‚Äôd say."
114,Canada should stop helping with the fires in the US. Canada needs to stop helping with the wars overseas.
115,Tariffs just mean more money in the wealthy's pocket - via the consumer
116,Obviously Trump didn't put 25% on energy because that would hurt them the most
117,"As an american, I am truly asahmed. I grew up knowing that Canada and Mexico are our closest allies, friends, and neighbors in all regards. Its true a majority of Americans voted for him, please understand many also did not. And we are angry."
118,Where‚Äôs all trump drug rehab centers helping drug addiction
119,Think it would of just been easier to beef up security on the boarder..
120,Tariffs are tax
121,All countries should unit to against this Mad King
122,"We're neighbors due to our joined borders, We're friends as we share common history - Lets be good partners as we trade massively; not fight!!!"
123,My maga friends just texted me about the price of gas this morning and he was shocked. Man these people runied it for everyone
124,"As a US citizen, thank you for standing up to this bully. Over two thirds of our country didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. We need our neighbors help."
125,Trump needs to be behind bars!
126,The problem is prices will go up now and when they settle an agreement the prices won‚Äôt go down 
127,"Lucky we are rich in the US.  We can afford more taxes, higher prices, and inflation.  Oh, wait‚Ä¶"
128,With Elon and Trump now working with Qardun Token is going to absolutely blow up
129,This will be the downfall of the USA
130,"So Canada,  Mexico, and China must impose additional tax on US goods and services"
131,This guy is hilarious!!  He thinks Trump is thinking out to 2026!!!! The guy that just gave EVERY air traffic controller a please resign letter even though there is already a shortage!! DUDE wake up!!!
132,"As an American, I support this. Trump is an absolute nightmare for everyone."
133,Okay but don‚Äôt let this distract you from the fact Mr. Krabs sold SpongeBob‚Äôs soul for 62 cents.
134,Stop all trucking through Canada to Alaska. They can find their own way!
135,Trump makes America more isolated country into his period as Preident surely.  China will get more and better economic & more export to EU cause of  Trump¬¥s trade war.   EU-contries are preparing for Trump¬¥s tariff. Finally America by Trump will loose more.  Best Wishes from Sweden  
136,I think it‚Äôs time to cool down the momentum of trump from outside of the US by boycotting US goods globally so that those trump voters from within could know US needs to be a responsible player on the global stage.
137,OH CANADA
138,"As an American, I support Canada and Mexico unconditionally.  Retaliation is the only option to stop a bully.  Canada should stop all energy trade and Mexico needs to stop all supply chains into and out of the US.  It will be painful but it needs to be done.  Any renegotiation of a trade agreement between our countries will be to their detriment."
139,Canada should become less reliant on US as a trading partner. If it hurts the economy that bad it should never have been allowed to happen in the first place. Trump is tough but smart and understands the economy. Things will get better for both countries as they learn to rely on their own products which in turn will strengthen the economy. Stupid people do not become billionaires.
140,"Tariffs are nothing more than a different way to ""tax"" the USA."
141,The President is doing an economical version of Russia Ukraine. Those poor American citizens
142,on behave of America I apologize to Mexico and Canada
143,It would be great if we had a real president instead of a vindictive bully boy in the White House.
144,"Who ever wanted trump in, here you go you clowns"
145,"And little Canada and Mexico took a couple hours to fold their cards to my commander-in-chief. It‚Äôs ok, we‚Äôll keep you two safe "
146,"President Trump, say Tariff Backfire..."
147,"Americans will feel it ,next time to vote wisely"
148,"I‚Äôm sorry Mr. T, but you are hurting your own people by those tariffs Ô∏èÔ∏è"
149,The man is just insane
150,How will this madness benefit anyone?
151,Canada & Mexico let's do business with ASEAN countries. 
152,How about 100% Tarrif on Apple and Tesla and stop buying fighter jets.
153,The USA is not going to be great with these tariffs against their allies. I wish Canadians would face this economic aggression with determination. Canada is not going to be the 51st state of the United States. Never.
154,Canada should not do anything and let the usa know that these tactics will only raise the cost of living
155,"Didn`t Trump read the Bible ""Love Thy Neighbor""; ""Not Tariff Thy Neighbor"""
156,"OH MEXICO 
OH CANADA
OH JUSTIN
OH SCIENBAUM-PARDO"
157,This is not about drugs coming into the US. This is about Trump's power and ego and him building a total s**t show.
158,Hopefully Britain will be smart and capitalise on the whole situation
159,"Yeah! Let's make Americans pay more to punish other countries! Wait, that doesn't make any sense....."
160,Mexican brothers: Emilia Perez prepared us for this. Let‚Äôs stay strong and show the gringos that our country is stronger than they think and that we do not smell like guacamole and mezcal. This is a big chance to make history!
161,These people are destroying the world and treating it like a game
162,I will try to buy mainly EU products from now on. I don‚Äôt need most of the stuff we buy from the US and China (I‚Äôm from the EU).
163,"We're done with USMCA and tariff free trade. We don't need Canada and Mexico making our cars, producing our lumber, etc. etc. Why pay them to do it, when we can do it in the US? We have our own trees, we don't need to buy Canadian lumber and give them money, that could be given to our US lumber producers."
164,Boycott all us goods
165,"As a European I hope this will change the whole global market, into one where the US and the dollar isn‚Äôt dictating everything. 

As an example, the US stock market is insane now. Crazy inflated and about to burst.

New trade routes and partnerships between good willing democracies in 2025 and beyond!"
166,"THE STORY ON TARIFFS
>According to recent reports it has been stated that the export volume to the United States of petroleum crude is expected to double over the next several years. That is a significant number. So, even if this figure does not double, any important increase in this export volume together with a high tariff wall, will hit the everyday American hard and American businesses, too. 
>No country consumes as much oil as the United States, and Canada ranks in the top four in the world with its resource of confirmed oil reserves. The United States consumes more oil per day than the combined total of the next three countries, China, India and Japan. There is no more secure source of this vital resource than in the province of Alberta, Canada. 
>American refineries, as this writer understands the technology, were designed specifically to refine the type of crude that comes from Canada. The volume of crude coming from Canada into the United States is over four million barrels per day and this represents twenty to twenty-five percent, roughly, of the daily consumption rate in the US which is itself over twenty million barrels per day! Any tariffs by the Trump administration will hit hard and will hit immediately. 
>With regard to potash, Canada has a huge resource of this commodity. This potash is a secure source unlike some of the other sources. Canada produces 16 million tons per year, which is more than Russia, China and Belarus combined. So, where would the US prefer to source its potash? Add this to the enormous export of crude to the US and one can see how this imposition of a tariff would have a serious impact on the US everyday citizens, and especially in the agricultural sector. Commentators in the US present the notion that the US can absorb the tariffs on these exports to the US; however, every time an American citizen goes to the gas station or goes to the grocery store, they will see the true cost of these two tariffs immediately.
>Now, we have had trade disputes before between Canada and the US, but these were resolved through negotiations. All that crude being shipped to the US each day is heavily discounted. When analyzing the trade in crude it could very well be that Canada is 'subsidizing' the US. We here in North America had better start looking at the big picture, and the world, as it is changing. Now is not the time to be threatening friends and allies."
167,All that sweet money coming in from those tariffs .... gonna be easy now to pay for tax cuts for the rich !
168,US exports equaled Mexico+Canada exports times two! Not happy but I got my popcorn ready 
169,Fancy BBC asking if there is anyway back from the brink for America when you've not asked that same question ten-fold about Britain. Rich thatÔ∏è
170,"tariffs make the prices go up in america,he is insane and really not stable enoughto be president, and prices in uk are still high post covid, price of eggs wouldnt alter my vote"
171,"I like Trump but he just doesn't understand that this will hurt Americans. Louisiana refines Canadian oil. That is really their primary industry. It might help some and really hurt others. Lumber to build all the houses destroyed in the natural disasters will double. Also, Canada is our best friend and this is just rude."
172,Short-term struggles will pave way to a long-term solution to a problem that we have been dealing with for far too long
173,"'This is an own goal by the USA they will suffer'

'In retaliation, Mexico and Canada should impose their own tariffs'

Wait. What?"
174,"Trump is doing a great job of raising all prices for hard working Americans.

Are they regretting voting him back in yet?"
175,üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Trump crazy 
176,Yeah this aged like fine milk. Mexico has caved already.
177,"Yet overwhelmingly gun violence is the biggest issue in America, Mexico. American made and illegally transported into blue states and and Ally countries. But us has no mention of that"
178,"Canada and Mexico: Don‚Äôt give in and appease Trump. The longer this goes the worse it is for him. Let it fall apart on his watch, it‚Äôs the best way to hurt him. Signed, an American."
179,üá¶üá∫  üá®üá¶
180,"The truth is that since Canada has 41.5 million citizens and the U.S. has 346.5 million citizens, the ""Hurt"" is going to be a LOT worse for Canada. I can do @ $800.00 dollars more a year, especially since this will cut taxes and most likely put me in the plus column. I don't agree with the tariffs but if it's for the good of the U.S. I'm OK with President Trump doing what needs to be done to make America great again."
181,"Just a note to people of the USA. What happens to the USA if Canada decides to completely cut off electricity/oil and rare earth metals to them?. Are they going to be building new hydro electric dams/mines/oil pipelines in the next year or five? because they cost HUGE money and take a very long time to build, and guess where all that money is coming from. There's a big reason why the USA is buying from Canada/Mexico and China, it's because they need them, because they can't supply themselves with the amounts of things they need. Canada, Mexico and China can and will (in quick time now) find other/new customers. While it may be painful in the short term it WILL BE happening, but what about the US?. They've effectively alienated and isolated themselves from most of the free world that were willing to supply/deal with them now, and in the future. Canada is the second largest country on earth with a small population but HUGE amounts of oil/water/electricity and rare earth minerals which most believe is the true reason Trump wants them to become the ""51st State"". The problem is, much of the USA's ""common folk"" don't understand how tariffs work. I believe this is going to be bad for everyone concerned ""the little people"", but more so for the US in the long term. The countries (their populations, which control the vote of their leaders) that they once relied on to supply them, will now be turning against them because they no longer trust them and will be be VERY reluctant about dealing with them in the future because of this after Trumps gone. If I understand American Politics correctly, your Presidents can only serve two terms and this is Trumps second, and last kick at the can. 

Best for the people of the USA to be looking a bit further down the road they're on. There's a reason why Trump said he loves ""the poorly educated"" in 2016."
182,"I think if if I was Mexico, and due to these tariffs and the money lost due to them, I'd very publicly say that regrettably they were going to have to suspend all border operations preventing illegal immigrants from leaving Mexico."
183,Wow trump imposed a 25% inflation on its own people overnight 
184,OH MEXICO
185,Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall. _ Provo. 16:18

188,"I Agree, Mexico Could Have Stopped Those Immigrants"
189,"He said ""830 dollars in extra taxes""  ?? Is that per month per annum???? But of course the journalist was not competent enough to clarify the issue."
190,"I feel lost when it comes to planning my investments. Everyone says to ""invest for the long term,"" but what does that even mean? How do you figure out what to focus on when your horizon keeps shifting?"
191,"I am at the beginning of my ""investment journey"", planning to put 385k into dividend stocks so that I will be making up to 30% annually in dividend returns. any good recommendation on great performing stocks or Crypto will be appreciated."
192,MEXICO STATICID 0% TARIFFS FOR M√âXICO
193,All US allies should immediately cancel all military purchases from the US. Also 1000% tariffs on Elmos Swastikacars. Trump would fall out of a window or have a trip to Dallas within a week...
194,Teump is too much. Distracting everything he gets along
195,BBS is so full of shit lol..... Ill pay more to watch them realize that they need US more then we need Them
196,Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt understand we don‚Äôt need Mexico or Canada

198,"FYI America is NOT a country!!!
United States is a country"
199,"Thats right EUROPE do not need American junk, we love our Chinese trade, we buy Chinese car its affordable and excellent quality. That the new Chinese Norm Quality !"
200,It sure feels like the US is being strangled by stupidity from the highest office.
201,"In the short-term, this is going to hurt both American and tariff hit country consumers. However, if the USA is going to send the world into recession with a trade war, we are going to look back at more recent times when the USA plunged the world into recession and the world this time around, just might realise that the less dealings it has with that country the better. I'm sure that everyone remembers the 'sub-prime loans' and the subsequent collapse of the financial industry and how it affected the global economy. All because of American greed and irresponsibility. How many more times are we going to allow this clown of a country to pull us down? The Trump Tariffs are an excellent opportunity to collaborate and cooperate more with each other and send Trump and his goons a clear message, but not only them but any future American leader with similar delusions of grandeur. I very much hope that the BRICS countries will follow through with their dispensing of the US dollar as the main currency. The UK and the EU should immediately commence talks with Canada to purchase their oil and have Canada divert a high percentage that is currently sold to the USA to Europe."
202,"Trump promised to fight inflation, he missred the teleprompter. Trump's policy is to fight for inflation. Trump fighting Bidden <3% Trmp want 30% inflation next week."

210,Oh look at the rest of the world is getting mad at us for trying to fix our own country

229,Awww yall sounded so proud  sorry but your countries will always bow down to Daddy Trump and America 
230,"I'll give you an example of why you'll pay 10% more for every product in a year. We humans are stupid when we let a businessman be a politician. 25 percent tariff?? In a year, you'll pay 10% more for every product.For example, let's take a washing machine, an American washing machine, a European washing machine, now each one is $2,000. After a 25% tariff, a European washing machine is $2,500. The difference is $500. What will the American washing machine manufacturer think?? If I raise the price of my washing machine by 3 percent, they will still buy mine. In three months, I will raise the price of my washing machine again by 6 percent. In the next three months, I will raise the price of my washing machine by another one percent. The difference will only be 15 percent between the prices of American washing machines and European washing machines. And this happens with every single  statement will be easy to prove if you see a product that comes from Europe and the same product is made in America. Will there be a 25 percent difference between the prices of the two products? If there is no 25 percent difference, then I was right.this policy is called hidden taxation,
which shouldn't be called a tax.
and the american people ate it up.only business circles benefit from this tariff policy and not people...just watch the price movements.."
231,"SOMEONE HAS WRITTEN HERE ‚ÄúPUNISHING OTHER COUNTRIES FOR AMERICAS DRUG ADDICTION WHAT A JOKE‚Äù come on MR TRUMP AMERICA SURELY CAN DO BETTER IS THERE ANY WAY OF ENCOURAGING A CHANGE OF BEHAVIOUR ‚Äú I say this kindly, it cannot be denied."

246,It's funny that is 25% to an ally and 10% to a foe.
247,"Canada has a 180 billion dollar trade annual imbalance.  This is not fair trade and Americans are tired of being taken advantage of. During the Cold War, the US accepted this as part of a larger strategy, in order to counter the Warsaw Pact . Those days are long gone.  Canada needs to increase usa purchases, stop illegal border crossing, stop fentanyl precursor trafficking, build subsidiaries in the USA, increase nato spending to 5% of gdp for a decade."
248,"Canada and US, we should be good friends. Canadians, let us work together to make our economy stronger."
249,Told ya Canada woulda been much better off siding with China

321,"I think the tariff on oil may actually only negatively affect US consumers. Based on some guesswork but more than likely correct imo. 
1) I assume that US refineries would have long term offtake agreements with the oil producers.
2) these contracts will be priced in $US/bbl. with the price based on international marker crudes 
3) excise duties (tariffs), pipeline charges etc. will be payable by the importer.
Under the above scenario, the exporter (Canada) is going to get the same amount in $US after the tariff as they did before but the importer will pay more for each bbl.
There is not much wriggle room for the importer as they need heavy crude which Canada is supplying and they probably don't have the infrastructure to import another heavy crude from elsewhere in the world. Similarly the exporter probably cannot pivot to selling their crude into another market due to lack of infrastructure. Given long enough both parties could develop the necessary infrastructure. 
It gets better for the exporter because the US dollar has formed (it always does in times of uncertainty) and the Canadian dollar has dropped significantly. So their revenue when converted to Canadian dollars has increased but their costs have remained the same."

372,Stop the fentanyl
373,"Even if Canada didn‚Äôt retaliate, we CONSUMERS would have to pay for it. Do you honestly think the companies are willing to submit to Trump? They will just put the weight on us.

375,"So wait. The importer of the goods is the one who ultimately pays the tariffs. So when trump placed the tariffs, American importers are paying the price and that trickles down to the American consumer in the form of higher prices. So in essence, trump made it harder for American businesses and consumers and in retaliation, Canada and Mexico essentially said ‚Äú oh yea? Well now we‚Äôre gonna make things harder for our own people too!‚Äù "

All I hear is Canada/Mexico  having ""no choice"" but to impose thier own tariffs....or.....or.....maybe just curb the drug smuggling, human trafficking, illegal immigration into America.

Seems like a significantly more productive behavior. "
397,Supporting Canada from Japan!
398,"Y‚Äôall posted this too late, it was postponed because Canada and Mexico send troops and equipment to the border to help fight illegal migration and drug smugglers. That‚Äôs what you call a forced win. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs Presidents are supposed to do. Get stuff done."
399,Point made. I see getting documented in USA is a very lengthy process. Perhaps President Trump can get this more streamlined.  He has said he wants documented immigrants in USA...

406,"This chap sounds so British, interesting‚Ä¶.."
407,Canada will never bow to that horrible bully 
408,"While retaliatory tariffs may seem like a courageous stand to Canada‚Äôs leaders, by simply following the executive order put forth by Trump and implementing robust measures to secure their borders and tackle illegal drug trafficking, the tariffs will be lifted. But I guess that's too hard for them."
409,What's the purpose of this tariff war???

414,"Canada and Mexico are right to retaliate by counter balancing the tariff imposition by Trump. 
This will lead to the expenditure reduction effect on all tariff imposing and retaliating countries, leading to damnification of national income, outputs, and job repercussions with inflationary pressures."

427,Canada wanted to know why they were getting a hire tariff than China.  The answer is that China already has tariff do the 10 is being added to that number.  Yes tarriffs might hurt US in the short term but it will hit Canada and Mexico worse in the long tun as there is massive deregulation being implemented into the US simultaneously.

454,"WHY I'M BOYCOTTING AMERICAN PRODUCTS - BUT STILL WATCHING THE SUPER BOWL IN MEXICO - I‚Äôve made a decision to boycott all American products in response to the U.S. government‚Äôs unilateral and unprovoked economic attack on Mexico and Canada. This is my way of taking a stand against policies that hurt our neighbors and partners.
But some have asked: What about the Super Bowl?

Here‚Äôs my stance: I will watch the game, but I will do so at a local Mexican-owned bar in Playa del Carmen, where my money directly benefits hardworking Mexican people‚ÄîNOT American corporations. The bar owner, servers, and cooks are not responsible for U.S. government actions, and they don‚Äôt deserve to be caught in the crossfire of a boycott.

To stay true to my commitment:

 I will not buy American-branded products‚Äîonly local or non-U.S. options.
 I will use this moment to spread awareness and encourage discussion.
 I may donate an equal amount to a cause that fights economic injustice in Mexico and Canada.

Boycotts are personal choices, and I respect that others may see things differently. But I encourage everyone to think critically about where their money goes and what kind of world they want to support."

496,"Apparently there is a 30 day freeze on the implementation of the tariffs. But Canada, Mexico and China should be looking for other markets in any case for their products.  If  USA wants to isolate itself, let it be isolated - like China under Mao and Albania under Hoxha. One difficulty is that Europe and China do not have good competing products for Google, Apple, etc. Tiktok is not really a competitor for YouTube, since it specialises in ""shorts"".  As for Facebook, I personally wouldn't care if it disappeared tomorrow."
497,"To build a fairer and more humane future for immigrants in the United States, we need a comprehensive approach that includes legal reforms, respect for human rights, investment in home countries, cultural change within the U.S., and greater international cooperation. Here are some key solutions:

 A Fair and Accessible Immigration Reform
The immigration system should be clearer and more humane, providing a real path to citizenship for those who have already built their lives in the U.S. It‚Äôs also crucial to offer more legal work and residency opportunities to reduce irregular immigration, while ensuring border security without separating families.

 Protecting Immigrants‚Äô Rights
No matter where you come from or your immigration status‚Äîeveryone deserves to be treated with dignity. It‚Äôs essential to eliminate discrimination, guarantee access to education, healthcare, and housing, and oversee immigration agencies to prevent abuses.

 Supporting Home Countries
Many people migrate out of necessity, not choice. If the U.S. invests in the development of home countries‚Äîcreating jobs, education, and stability‚Äîfewer people will be forced to leave their homes in search of better opportunities.

 A Cultural and Political Shift in the U.S.
To ensure immigrants are valued, society must be educated about their positive contributions. This means launching awareness campaigns, encouraging community integration, and supporting leaders who advocate for social justice.

 International Cooperation for a Better Future
The immigration issue is not just a U.S. problem‚Äîit‚Äôs global. Countries must work together to create solutions that benefit everyone, protect migrants' rights, and promote safe and orderly migration.

 Conclusion
If we act with humanity and commitment, we can transform the immigration system into one that is fair and equitable. Immigration is not a threat‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to strengthen society and the economy. It‚Äôs time to recognize the value of every person, no matter where they come from. "

519,Mexico and Canada putting tariffs on red states....take that trump
520,In the movies US always saves the world. In reality it is the world that needs to be saved from the US...
521,Mexico can rely less on American and open up further talks for investment with China then stick it back to the American to lower there tariff and failing to do so will see further pivoting toward China. That how you negotiate with America.
522,Think BBC have know idear what President Trump wants cant understand why people keep underestimating this man
523, they could send their products half way around the world.  I am sure they relish the prospect especially since the average person in those countries does not have near the economic level of a US citizen.

556,"Canada should deny entry to the pumpkin for the G7 summit this summer. He is a convicted felon, so legally they can do that "
557,But the idiot announced them well before!
558,"Trump Tariffs will lower food prices for Canadians but raise them for the USA. Canada pork, beef, chicken and grain products will no longer be able to compete with USA suppliers so their only market will be Canada. This should drive down the Canadian price of meat and grain products (including bread and cereals). In addition, Canada's greenhouse produce should be much cheaper. So when Canada's food prices start rise blame Trudeau's misguided counter tariffs on American farm produce. 

What we can all expect is that unemployment in the private sector will rise to 20%, our economy will contract into a depression as Canadian manufacturers permanently go out of business, and Justin and Dougie (two peas in a pod) will borrow $200+ billion to pay people to stay home from work and corporate welfare. That same amount of money spent on procurement of equipment for our military, border security, and national anti-drug policing would make Canada and the USA safer, it would convince the Americans that were serious about border security, it would bring our military spending to 2% of GDP immediately and create high paid jobs in the USA and Canada to show that were serious about our international and national defense commitments."
559,Trump not bello or speak of hot air. He saw where usa fell. He picking back up. No one said independence is easy
560,Don't really understand the reasoning behind this. There is some reason Trump is doing this. I don't really purchase things from Canada and Mexico. Maybe it's cars and other things made in Mexico. Maybe Trump wants more cars and other things made away from Mexico.

566,Thank you Trump
567,What would happen if Trump had a massive heart attack ( besides everyone laughing).
568,Canada and Mexico choose not to cooperate with United States.    Its all good.  America would benefit from a complete shutoff of canada and mexico whereas their economies would likely collapse.
569,"Tariffs are likely to be wide-sweeping. they won't stop with just these countries. I expect Australia will be hard hit at some stage. Anyway, how did Canada get caught up in all this? It's been a good little US pet for decades. Mexico I can kind of understand. They just left the borders largely uncontrolled from their side - The cartels run the show at the border."
570,Discuss Immigrants. Drugs.
571,40+ years ago i worked the front counter of our shop-a guy came in and he started talking --i will cut out the rest of the story exept for words still ringing in my ears---just watch the usa become a third world country---he was not wrong
572,Canada should push their local government to make it very expensive for any American who wants to plan a hunt in Canada. Also tripple the cost of any fishing excursion planned by Americans. I got a feeling that Trump may not be president for too long. I think america is getting a taste of very bad government deals.trump is really setting america up to stand alone. They won't survive.

611,MAGA. What is it that we really NEED from mexico or canada??
612,Trump üá∫üá∏All it took was action not napping.
613,"Well the case in point is how to manoeuver the political landscape of cooperation for the common good at times of such a protracted multi-polarism or emerging new world order where thinking out of the box is inevitable and outweighing the business as usual way of thinking. Trump is in a good shape and America is in a good hand to pro-actively engage in probable happenings and respond to challenging changes that affect the western hemisphere. Yet, no need for provocative measures. There are a lot more agenda that bring both United States and Canada together. Canada is so vital to the United States and the other way round. Let's have a second thought to divert challenges into opportunities and make inclusive Mexico and China too"

Btw, If claim is that middle class will pay, it will increase corporate profits that increases mrkt cap feeds into 401K. This is not even considering treasury will pay back Debt reducing interest payment that is a Trillion dollars in budget....biggest line item. 
""Are a record $1.2 trillion interest payments blowing up the federal budget?
The key is the yearly interest payments, which the U.S. Treasury Department's October report estimated will hit a record $1.2 trillion for fiscal year 2025, which ends next Sept. 30. The Federal Reserve Board's Nov. 7 interest-rate cut by one-quarter percentage point could reduce that somewhat."""
617,"I hate this guy. Everything about him. But to make a fair point: Trump used economic leverage to incentivize Mexico to take more responsibility for its own border, which is like a sieve. He is right about that. He didnt back down with Mexico, he is giving them tone to make good on the commitment of 10,000 Mexican National Guards to be added to border security. Thats called a victory. It's rhe only smart thing he has done, so it should be pretty obvious. Spinning it as him ""backing down""...That really is fake news. We don't beat propaganda with propaganda. I'm so disappointed in how compartmentalized people have become. Everything is gaslighting now. Grow up."

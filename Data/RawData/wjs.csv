President Trump’s aggressive move to place tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China could trigger a trade war. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum negotiated with Trump at the last minute, putting tariffs on Mexico on hold for a month.

I'll never understand why trade deficits are seen as such a bad thing in Trump's eyes. Exporting our dollars is the reason why we are so strong and why our currency is the global reserve. If trump wants to stop exporting dollars then he will have to deal with China and other BRICS nations wanting to create and replace their own currency as the world reserve.

Here is how having a blithering idiot for a president is affecting US companies. I had to pick up a couple of things in the store today and replaced 6 items I usually buy, made in the US, with others for a total of roughly Canadian $35. Had it been a weekly grocery haul that would have been $100++. Might not sound like a lot but millions and millions of people are doing the same thing. US products all over my usual store looked like they had just filled the shelf seconds ago, no one was touching it. Your problems go far deeper than tariffs.

The economy is in crisis, facing severe instability due to a collapsing housing market, skyrocketing foreclosures, and persistent global turmoil. The lingering effects of the pandemic continue to wreak havoc, while runaway inflation, stagnating growth, and widespread trade disruptions push industries and households to the brink. Without immediate intervention, the situation risks spiraling further into recession, deepening financial hardships across the board.

The US has been dragging the Canadian economy along for far too long.. Numbers do not lie. Canada imposes a variety of EXISTING tariffs on different US exports. Here are some specifics based on available information:

Agricultural Products: Canada has tariffs on several US agricultural products including milk (270%), cheese (245%), butter (298%), poultry (238%), and eggs (163%). Other products like barley (160%), wheat (94%), sugar (265%), peanut butter (295%), rice (150%), vegetables (100%), and fish products (100%) also face significant tariffs.


Other Goods: Beyond agriculture, tariffs are applied to commodities like lumber (20%), shoes (30%), cocoa (30%), metals (25%), wool (30%), and tobacco (over 100%).

trump is guilty of having said many idiotic things. The most recent - ""WE are subsidizing China, Mexico, and Canada."" It's quite the strange subsidy when Americans voluntarily buy more goods from all 3 countries than they voluntarily buy from us. This trade imbalance ain't a subsidy. Fifty years ago, US oligarchs decided to take THEIR country back - and they did this by deindustrializing the US in return for vastly cheaper labor, thereby industrializing other countries. Cheap labor is the cause of these trade imbalances and the only folks who were ""subsidized"" are US oligarchs.

The hard numbers : 60% of the parts used in the American automobile assembly plant come from Canada and Mexico. 
In total GM, Ford, Stellantis,Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru Hyundai,  Kia, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes have 46 automobile assembly plants. 
No parts = No automobile assembly + Massive layoffs! These 46 automobile assembly plants employ one million American workers !
Also, finding alternatives for the steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico will take months !  
If the Trump tariffs are implemented, one million American workers will be layoff !

For God's sake... It is as simple as this: the company that imports goods from abroad to sell them in Murrica has to pay the tariff, consequently, it has to pass that cost on to consumers. Why can't the evil foreign producer be punished with tariffs? Simple: The tariff is paid by the importer and not by the foreign producing factory because the tax is applied at the time the merchandise enters the destination country, not in the country of origin.

This video didn’t age well… and it’s only been 45 minutes 
The Tariffs aren't going to make us richer but make the cost of living more expensive.
"If you are Canadian and you are reading this, I love you brother/sister and I'm sorry that corrupt politicians are attempting to turn us against each other. Sincerely, your Wisconsin neighbor."
"Trump signed an executive order that reads, Trump is the best president ever. This was right after Trump signed an executive order allowing us to call our parents mom and dad.   Only Trump could have done this.  "
"Tariffs exist to protect your own companies from flooding your market with cheap Chinese stuff which your companies can't compete with, not to force rest of world to buy your stuff."
"Fckg awesome--- its 2008 AGAIN --- homes,funds GONE. Come on PEOPLE"
Does encouraging a country to put an army at your border seem weird and unwise?
"The hard numbers : 60% of the parts used in the American automobile assembly plant come from Canada and Mexico. 
In total GM, Ford, Stellantis,Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru Hyundai,  Kia, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes have 46 automobile assembly plants. 
No parts = No automobile assembly + Massive layoffs! These 46 automobile assembly plants employ one million American workers !
Also, finding alternatives for the steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico will take months !  
If the Trump tariffs are implemented, one million American workers will be layoff !"
"So good to know americans are learning about ""Tariffs"". "
The shroud of darkness surrounds everything. Begun the trade wars have.
Honestly as someone who voted for him I’m pretty annoyed I just don’t get the point now everything is getting more expensive
"Couldn't he have just requested a summit to discuss issues with Canada instead of trotting out this obnoxious, manipulative game? This is the way vulgar douchebags do business, not world leaders who have even a scintilla of class. Even worse, he fully expects this disrespect to be met with deference."
Its been 3 days.  Propaganda media here
"For God's sake... It is as simple as this: the company that imports goods from abroad to sell them in Murrica has to pay the tariff, consequently, it has to pass that cost on to consumers. Why can't the evil foreign producer be punished with tariffs? Simple: The tariff is paid by the importer and not by the foreign producing factory because the tax is applied at the time the merchandise enters the destination country, not in the country of origin."
"The entire Wall Street Journal editorial board should be fired. Unfathomable that anyone still takes them seriously.

Enjoy losing."
"Im not an expert on the situation, but i believe this is a temporary problem for a long-time solution. Before trump was president, weren't we paying high tariffs from other countries to begin with?"

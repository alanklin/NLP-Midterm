You have to rebuild LA and NC, and you wanna make Canadian wood products more expensive. America does not have anywhere close to the amount of trees that Canada has. This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen trump say. America doesn't subsidize Mexico or canada. They never have. And the trade deficit between America and Canada is because America makes nothing. If you guys manufactured stuff there would be more to buy. But you sent everything to china/india. Canada actually subsidizes the forestry industry so that they can sell america cheaper products. 
Love trump, but he is beyond wrong here.

Taxation is a way to balance trade relations. The U.S. has been permissive with Europeans, Chinese, and Latin Americans, keeping import rates low, while countries impose high tariffs on American products, as in Brazil, with rates of 100%. So, 25% is still a kindness from the Americans.

Remove oil, which the US depends on, and the US has a trade surplus with Canada. These tariffs make no sense. All it will do is increase the price of Canadian goods in America, but it will also make exports to Canada more expensive. And even if he thinks he can avoid a tariff of oil, Canada can just put an export tax on it. See what happens to gas prices when 60% of oil in America gets 25% more expensive‚Ä¶when the mid-west depends on that oil!

Canada is like a lemonade stand that is selling a lemonade (heavy crude)  not many really want to buy.  The USA says we will buy your lemonade because we can use it for something else that we do more than anyone in the world ( build  paved roads).  Matter of fact we will take most of that lemonade to help you out but at a reduced price.  Not only that but we will protect your lemonade stand from anyone all the time no matter the cost. You can even funnel that lemonade through our yard to the eastern half of your stand.

Actually the tariffs on products sold to Canada will cause pricing for same said products to be cheaper in the U.S. for U.S. citizens and here is why?   Canada is immediately threatening to cut back on buying or boycotting some to many of the products that will have tariffs put on them by the U.S.  This will increase the surplus of those products in the U.S. and in order for the companies to quickly sell or even sell them at the normal rate of speed those companies products will have to be reduced in price for U.S. buyers.   Basic law of supply and demand.  In effect for every product that is boycotted by Canada creates a surplus of that product in the U.S. making that product lower in cost for U.S. consumers and/or businesses.  So while the selling company may lose some money until they find other markets for their product where their product is not tariffed.  As far as the products that Canada wants to sell to the U.S. that they will be slapping tariffs on for the most part will not sell in the U.S. for the simple reason that we do in reality have an abundance of those minerals and the products that they are offering to us.  The exception to this is oil unless Trump has worked out a way to make up for the oil that we normally buy from Canada which is entirely possible.

The basis for Trump's tariffs is he wants to protect American manufacturing. That sounds nice in theory, but it comes with economic consequences. In a free market, competition is good. The more competition the better. It gives companies an incentive to make better products. If you take away the competition the losers are consumers who have less choices and are stuck with inferior products. As a consumer I want to buy the best product at the lowest prices. And if that item happens to be made in another country so be it. Don't tell me that I should buy inferior products at higher prices because of patriotism. All you're doing is taking away my freedom to choose.

Note with regards to Canada: The US trade deficit for the last 3 years has been about ~ $40 Billion per year NOT the 100, or the 200, or the 300, or the 350 Billion that depending on the day Trump has been claiming. Prior to this period of time the US trade deficit was closer to zero. Reason for the Trade deficit being $40 Billion was the relative large world price oil / gas last 3 to 4 years. Lastly, subtracting trade of oil and gas, US would have a large trade SURPLUS with Canada.

Trump has also played on words. If I buy an apple off my neighbour, I am not 'subsidizing' or being  'abusing' my neighbour. If I buy 2 apples off my neighbour, I am not greatly 'subsidizing' or  being greatly 'abused' by my neighbour. Given the logic /rhetoric I wonder what just stealing an apple off a neighbor means?? Ie if you steal an apple, I guess at least you would know that you weren't being abused by your neighbour. 

Trump has other goals , reasons for imposing tariffs, okay fine perhaps, but Trump and his followers should lay off the misleading rhetoric: the overall trade numbers and the choice of words/language.

In the case of Mexico, the trade surplus with the U.S. is enjoyed by foreign companies, mostly American companies that manufacture in Mexico given that country's cheap labor.  The tariffs on Mexico will be borne mostly by American companies since they are the ones with the most investments in that country.  This man does not know much about economics and his many bankruptcies attest to that fact.

I love Trump but don‚Äôt like what he‚Äôs doing here with the tariffs on my home country Canada. This is only thing I disagree with him on. We are neighbours and trade with eachother more than with any other G7 country. But at the same time, I understand what and why he is doing this. We basically have no one here in charge right now and have become an embarrassment on the world stage thanks to beta male Trudeau. I feel he‚Äôs doing this because of his disdain for Trudeau. Trudeau, like Biden who are both Dem leaders have ruined both countries and the cleanup on both sides is massive. I wish we could both come to the table with a fair trade agreement for both sides‚Äô benefit but doesn‚Äôt look like that is going to happen now. Who can Trump even talk to, much less respect here? Lol. What a joke! Trump put Canada on notice from November about cleaning up our side of the border‚Ä¶fair game and is definitely needed, but to be real, the drugs and guns coming into Canada is from the U.S. side via China and Mexico. The migrant problem from our end into the U.S. is due to the East Indians who migrate here from India as a pathway to get into the states. We are effectively screwed!

Memo to All American Visitors

Subject: Currency Exchange Policy in Response to U.S. Tariffs

Dear Valued American Customers,

Due to the unfair 25% tariffs imposed by  U.S. President Donald Trump on Canadian goods, businesses across Canada will now only accept U.S. currency at par. This means that $1 USD will be treated as $1 CAD, regardless of exchange rates.

While Canada has long welcomed American visitors with favorable exchange rates, these tariffs have placed an undue burden on our economy and businesses. In response, we are aligning our currency policies accordingly.

We appreciate your understanding and continued patronage, and we encourage you to use Canadian currency or credit/debit cards for transactions to ensure clarity in pricing.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
 Canada

When the American dollar is worth  40 cents more then more Americans will buy Canadian goods. It‚Äôs quite simple and not a subsidy.  This man doesn‚Äôt have a business sense in his head. That‚Äôs why he went bankrupt 7 times and still has mortgages on all his properties .

10,"Deflect all you want, he promised bringing prices down and is now telling us he will do the opposite. Plain and simple."
11,I am in $5k in $QARDUN 
12,Several clips surfacing about Bezos and Trump talking about $Qardun at the inaguration even with mike tyson 
13,US consumers will pay the tariffs? How is this good for the US?

20,If Canada treated the US badly why would he have ever negotiated and SIGNED a trade agreement in his first term?????
21,"Please use the correct term for ""tariffs"" - they're ""consumer taxes""."
22,He claims Canada and Mexico have treated the US badly when it comes to trade and he's the one who ripped up NAFTA and wrote the deal we have now.
23,We don't need anything from the US here in Canada  either really. Have we really treated you so poorly? Poor babies.
24,Cut off the alberta oil
25,Mexicans are used to suffering and getting ahead with effort and work. US  are not. We are not afraid of the United States or Trump.
26,Qardun Token has two of the largest Tesla shareholders already; most likely something is coming
27,"All said and done, Americans will end up with the short end of the stick."
28,"You have to rebuild LA and NC, and you wanna make Canadian wood products more expensive. America does not have anywhere close to the amount of trees that Canada has. This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen trump say. America doesn't subsidize Mexico or canada. They never have. And the trade deficit between America and Canada is because America makes nothing. If you guys manufactured stuff there would be more to buy. But you sent everything to china/india. Canada actually subsidizes the forestry industry so that they can sell america cheaper products. 
Love trump, but he is beyond wrong here."
29,Mexico should stop selling food to the US
30,MAKE THEM PAY MOOORE ! THERE NEVER GOING TO LEARN PLAYING NICE LIKE YEARS PAST !!!!
31,He has no idea how much Mexico and Canada contribute to American agriculture
32,Trump's economics make sense if it's your first week in high school and you read a bunch of stuff on conservative twitter and feel like you could solve all of America's problems with those ideas.
33,More trees than Canada?! You're officially a muppet.
34,We as Canadian have to say f you to the states they‚Äôre acting as if they made us
35,Why all this hostility towards Canada and the insults?  Be careful what  you wish for.
36,"He keeps telling people that countries pay tariffs, when in reality it is the companies importing the goods that pay them, and most of those companies are from the US ..."

c) Brazil 
d) The USA

43,Why has he already talked more to press than Biden in 4 years smh
44,well said. we don't need what they have
45,Trade war is a bad idea.
46,Donald Trump is going to shill Qardun Token hard now after the inaguration 
47,"Except clean water, electricity, oil , raw logs... you know.. things Canada sends and we need lol"
48,"More tree's and oil than Canada?!?... lmao, okay bud"
49,"Taxation is a way to balance trade relations. The U.S. has been permissive with Europeans, Chinese, and Latin Americans, keeping import rates low, while countries impose high tariffs on American products, as in Brazil, with rates of 100%. So, 25% is still a kindness from the Americans."
50,"0:29 We have a trade agreement negotiated by Trump. According to him, it's the greatest trade agreement in the world. Now he says Canada and Mexico don't treat America fairly. What a loon."
51,He won‚Äôt tariff Spray Tan I can guarantee that.
52,Canada should quit the 'western civilization' stuff and join BRICS already. China and India would love that oil.
53,US doesn‚Äôt have water. Canada does. Lots glacier fed fresh water.
54,Guess that friendship is toast.
55,The US currently does not have the capability to process the oil we drill. It would take billions of dollars to change that and the oil companies have already stated they will not invest into it. We cannot just say we are going to drill more oil. It‚Äôs much more complicated than that!
56,"Have you not tried tacos and maple syrup (not together). I need those in my life. Not to mention, Mexico makes some damn fine boots and leather goods. I'd rather buy products that are made in Mexico than products that are made in China."
57,It‚Äôs good for America manufacturing jobs if he taxes foreign companies. 
58,Trump vs the Mexican president is like Godzilla vs Mini Mouse 
59,I didn‚Äôt know Americans don‚Äôt need water to survive! We‚Äôll just keep all of ours to ourselves then. Thank guys! 
60,"Oh, we don't need anything Canada has?  That will change once we don't have anything and we turn to them for help, and we will if that situation happens. "
61,Turns out Americans do love paying higher prices. 
62,"Canad√°, M√©xico, BRICS"
63,"üá≤üáΩüá∫üá∏ Mexico is a great country, the best military and strategic commercial partner in the world for the United States of America, much more than Canada, it must make Mexico spend more on defense to deter the enemies of the United States from attacking through Mexico, also strengthen the Mexican army and air force, it will have a military partner for any defense including cartels and terrorists."
64,"This will be fun to watch in real time when it happens, that is if trump doesn't back down like he did on the Ukraine war wherein he said day 1 the war will be over. Or,where he froze federal aid and rescinded because he miscalculated. Let see what happens"
65,This is an opportunity for Mexico to diversify & mitigate tariffs!
66,He talks AT them with word salads and bold faced lies and the people eat it up. The US doesn‚Äôt need our cheap oil and electricity so let‚Äôs just turn it off. We don‚Äôt need the crap quality American vehicles made in America. We should cancel all military equipment that we have ordered including the over priced fighter jets and ships. The EU have excellent fighters we could purchase and we can go back to building our own ships. We can get produce from around the world and sell our natural resources and lumber to other countries. It‚Äôs about time we got the giant gorilla off our backs.
67,US is not first in Oil reserves.
68,"If we don‚Äôt have anything they need, then why does he want to make us the 51st state?"
69,"The American people are taxing themselves with these tariffs, the gov gets all the profit from the USA paying consumer."
70,China needs more to. Chinas goods are still streaming in at cheaper prices. give them 100% tariffs to make it fair to American businesses.
71,"Remove oil, which the US depends on, and the US has a trade surplus with Canada. These tariffs make no sense. All it will do is increase the price of Canadian goods in America, but it will also make exports to Canada more expensive. And even if he thinks he can avoid a tariff of oil, Canada can just put an export tax on it. See what happens to gas prices when 60% of oil in America gets 25% more expensive‚Ä¶when the mid-west depends on that oil!"
72,"So much for ""I will start bringing the cost of groceries down on day one of my presidency.""  ""The price of gas will be below $2.00 a gallon again."""
73,Freeing up the trees environmentally. I hope he's not talking about chopping down trees in national parks ü´§
74,Canada is more than happy to keep its raw resources at home. We need prices on fuel and lumber to come down in Canada üá®üá¶.  Can't remember the last time I bought anything from the States .
75,"Canadians are taking these words to heart, there is a growing movement across Canada and other countries to boycott all made in USA products and travel to the States while Trump is in office"
76,Love this guy. All action.
77,We don't need anything from our 2 biggest trading partners? I find that hard to believe.  But let trump tank the economy so we can figure out if we need Canada and Mexico
78,"Dude tariff Canada all you want, but tariff Mexico I don‚Äôt think is a good idea"
79,"Yawn.. We are already making deals with Europe and the rest of Latin America. 
The faster you all put up the wall and keep to yourselves the better."
80,"If you have all the oil you need, why isn't oil included now ?

Yes, I know the answer, it's BS, as if they don't have anything you need why is there a trade deficit  ?"
81,Good work. Let's bring those manufacturing jobs back here.
82,I'll always like Canadians whatever this shit is happening
83,We don't need any trees
84,we don't need your car parts.. or your food... I will make my own country pay if they need these things is really what he is saying... our prices only go up... the only people that get hurt is us.
85,We buy Mexican food
86,What about timber? Do you expect to log 30% more of US forests? You will find that hard to do. My suggestion is that we should deal with others as we wish to be treated by them!
87,Why does America keep punching itself in it's own face?
88,Made in the USA....yeap.
89,I just looked up what the profit margin is for car parts made in Mexico. It is 20-28%. So All those companies will go out of business because they aren't going to just operate at a loss. US auto plants can't assemble cars with non-existent parts. Why are we doing this?
90,If we dont need anything then there shluldnt be any price increase on anything for the consumer since we have everything here in america. Lets find out what happens
91,IM NOT GOING BACK TO HAITI !!!
92,Tariffs will sink the US economy.
93,I absolutely love this guy!
94,Imean he is right
95,Mr. President. Please decert and remember we cut 97% of the redwoods down. Not 50% or 25%. When did they tell you the financial crisis you're going to have to deal with is coming up and what year I'd like to know so I can place my bets.
96,"Technically, sending a drug to another country that causes lots of death is basically a weapon."
97,Crazy all these opportunities coming out lately.. me and my friends are all in on Qardun now
98,Goodbye guacamole for üá∫üá∏
99,canada can  put tons of tariffs on alaska. even the most crazy tariffs  to balace things out. they can get beer and juice from mexico. they have to move fast and be smart about it.
100,"Richest country in the world , richest people in the world ...and they have achieved that even though the rest of the world has been ripping them off for years...How do you achieve that...Don ......"
101,Everything made in the U.S. will be getting a 25%tariff and energies will be be getting hit harder
102,comments are split between Canadians coping and economic illiteracy.
103,"United States does not produce enough potash to meet its own demand... You need fertilizer for all things to do with agriculture, and the #1 supplier is Canadian potash... the other options are Russia, Belarus and China... So food in America will be become very expensive in coming months."

115,"Don't be a whimp, tarrif everything, including oil and wood.  Please.............  remember, u dont need anything from us."
116,"President Trump  - You're the man, but I call bullshit on that one...nice try though!"
117,Enjoy the massive inflation America! You asked for this.
118,True. Canada is not even a country.
119,"So hypocritical of him of excluding what would harm the US. Like the oil. 

In the end tariffs will be bad for Americans too. They just fail to see it. Americans have a veeeery short term memory. It‚Äôs kinda sad to witness."
120,"""we don't need anything they have!!! Yeah! Amegica First!"".... 

Three doritos later: ""Oh wait, they are our top two export clients in the world.... we need them!!! Please MexCan, come back!"""
121,One expert I saw on CNN said 25% tariffs would only add POINT-6% (0.06) to inflation. The example he gave - if inflation is 2% - it would only go up to 2.6%. That‚Äôs not going to break anybody‚Äôs budget.
122,Based
123,CEO of BMW is pleading to the EU to drop 10% car tariff. He knows the US tariffs will be bad news for BMW sales numbers.
124,What do you mean they dont treat you fairly on price? Canada sells oil at discounted well below global price to the US. It should sell it to europe and asia at full price then if thats 'unfair'.
125,Trump is a Wharton graduate. That invokes simultaneously conflicting emotions: Hopefulness and fearfulness
126,"This isn't between Walmart and target

 This isn't business as usual"
127,Ok so my eggs are 20  dollars at the store

By the way, that includes New York too. "
129,No one taught this guy about ‚Äúcomparative advantage‚Äù in college‚Ä¶
130,"Why the hell does that truck built in Mexico still cost over a $100,000.00, not buying it."
131,LOVE MY PRESIDENT 
132,Mexico and Canada plan to retaliate. Yall about to drop a bag on family dinner 
133,The entire point of tariffs is to increase prices. It's so over
134,this is ignorance on a entirely new level
135,Mainstream media is going to cry about this Qardun coin so hard soon
136,We need fruits and veggies in the winter.
137,AMERICA FIRST
138,He'll relax the tariffs as soon as they become a fair trade partner.
139,"Not a SINGLE professional has said that Trump's Tarriff strategy will HELP our economy if actually implemented... Trump has used tarrifs as a threat, he shouldn't ACTUALLY disrupt our economy in such a destructive manner."
140,President Trump 
141,What about avocados?! Lol
142,Eggs are going up to $20 in the next 6 months  thank you Mr. Trump
143,"Don't be cowards and support your president, the tariffs are certainly justified."
144,"remember when trump renegotiated the trade treaties with Canada and Mexico the first time around...he was quite proud of that achievement...the agreement hasn't been changed since then, so I guess it wasn't an achievement after all and he now needs to do it all again from failing the first time...."
145,Canada is like a lemonade stand that is selling a lemonade (heavy crude)  not many really want to buy.  The USA says we will buy your lemonade because we can use it for something else that we do more than anyone in the world ( build  paved roads).  Matter of fact we will take most of that lemonade to help you out but at a reduced price.  Not only that but we will protect your lemonade stand from anyone all the time no matter the cost. You can even funnel that lemonade through our yard to the eastern half of your stand.
146,"Uhhhh, the oil Canada sends you to refine at American refineries?! What a moron"
147,I'd make it 250% and if they don't like it we make states out of them.
148,they'll bow to the king
149,"He uses the tariffs to scare other countries into cooperating. People need to understand this. Both countries would suffer, but the US is in a better position to survive so it's more likely the country being hit with tariffs will cooperate."
150,I don‚Äôt buy any of the products anyway just like banning tick tok it won‚Äôt effect me either way
151,"Did you know how much aluminum usa in 1 year ? The equivalent big 1 aluminum smelter in Quebec. The tarif will impact what they can produce . Even with the tarif, you get a country with a median salaries of mexic 16000usd per years and canada 56000usd per years and usa, is 80115 per years."
152,We can drill in the USA
153,Get ready to see prices jump 25%.The US gets a ton of produce from Mexico which will impact most grocery products.
154,Ford makes their cars in Canada haha
155,lets face it...Canada cannot survive without US...sorry
156,Trump is on fire 
157,Doesnt need %60 of its oil? haha...enjoy.
158,"And then the power to New York went out.   Nope, Canada has nothing we need.  smh"
159,"Future news soon, Trump brings back Hoovervilles."
160,"If you listen carefully, he CAVED on Canadian oil.  He folded like an French omelet."
161,"okay but that Will affect more to the USA, people will pay higher prices for everything with tariffs."
162,"Except electricity in the entire northern half of our country and Alaska!!! Power we get from, wait for it.CANADA!! THE ABSOLUTE STUPIDITY OF THIS CON IS EXCEPTIONAL!!!!"
163,Except he conveniently left out oil because prices would skyrocket if he put a tariff on it lmao
164,I‚Äôm Canadian and I side with him‚Ä¶ Justin Trudeau has failed our country and some people still believe in the federal Liberal party. Perhaps we need to see Canada turn out way worse before we WAKE UP!
165,We need competitively priced product from those countries for the  working class consumers which high class Americans are not willing to sacrifice doing. We have Farmed out this country for economic gain
166,Best president
167,"He-he, what a president!"
168,Hell yes 
169,I find it funny everyone says tariffs dont work then answer this why would those same countries put tariffs on usa right after we do 
170,He's doing the right thing by americans.
171,America has become Jonestown.
172,"He is an idiot , out refineries aren't setup for American oil...."

176,Ban canadian oil
177,Get ready red states to pay a lot more
178,His idiocy continues.
179,"I like Trump, but this is foolish and stupid."
180,You wouldn‚Äôt have gas to run all the vehicles in the us without our oil. Don‚Äôt be stupid. You use 19 m barrel a day you produce 13m.
181,Remember that the ridiculous orange clown GRIFTER playing President thinks he's the smartest person he has ever met.   Act II Donnie......
182,Crazy to think Americans wanted this.
183,GO TRUMP! Bunch of cry baby know nothings got to the comments first.
184,This man can't even keep his lies in order.  I guess his parents never told him that his lies will catch up to him.
185,Why not do 25% on China?
186,"Good! Thank you, Mr. President. That's why we elected you."
187,American get ready to pay more on goods
188,Business man
189,"He just wanted his last 4 years to be action packed and fun filled! ""drill baby drill"" !!!"
190,About time!! That‚Äôs my president!
191,"ok go ahead and take away federal taxes then, get rid of the IRS as a trade off"
192,Q the recession. Mark this post. How dumb can he be.
193,"If dont need them, why still doing business with them?  Just end it..."
194,"ICO on Qardun is already at $54m, way too many insiders stacking up. I got my measly $400 in"
195,If you make everything your people need to work hard and long hours for little pay otherwise the prices will be unaffordable for usa citizens
196,These supply chains and logistical networks have been set up and evolved over time into the most efficient ways of conducting commerce. All these stupid fights he's picked for no reason. Fentanyl? Who's got the drug problem? Funny we can find all the hiding migrants but we can't find the drug dealers.
197,Should have hedged this election on Qardun Token 
198,Good cause in reality we don't need anything from other countries this beautiful country can substain itself
199,"Isn't it amazing how the amount of difference he claims continually changes. Started at 100 million, then 100 billion, then 200, then 250 and now it's down to 175 . What an absolute liar."
200,Actually the tariffs on products sold to Canada will cause pricing for same said products to be cheaper in the U.S. for U.S. citizens and here is why?   Canada is immediately threatening to cut back on buying or boycotting some to many of the products that will have tariffs put on them by the U.S.  This will increase the surplus of those products in the U.S. and in order for the companies to quickly sell or even sell them at the normal rate of speed those companies products will have to be reduced in price for U.S. buyers.   Basic law of supply and demand.  In effect for every product that is boycotted by Canada creates a surplus of that product in the U.S. making that product lower in cost for U.S. consumers and/or businesses.  So while the selling company may lose some money until they find other markets for their product where their product is not tariffed.  As far as the products that Canada wants to sell to the U.S. that they will be slapping tariffs on for the most part will not sell in the U.S. for the simple reason that we do in reality have an abundance of those minerals and the products that they are offering to us.  The exception to this is oil unless Trump has worked out a way to make up for the oil that we normally buy from Canada which is entirely possible.
201,The US population is used to being pampered.Argentina underwent pain but in a year they are much better off. The U.S. dollar is strong and they can change supply chains and still control the prices in the US
202,Trump is expected to mention Qardun Token this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
203,"So I would suppose US cost is going up for products , so does this mean old shitty pants will be paying more for "" Depends"" ?"
204,$Qardun is going to be the real trump coin
205,US doesn‚Äôt have water. Canada does. Lots glacier fed fresh water.
206,The US population is used to being pampered.Argentina underwent pain but in a year they are much better off. The U.S. dollar is strong and they can change supply chains and still control the prices in the US
207,We need the tariff money to protect ourselves
208,I‚Äôm not sure 25% is enough. Maybe some things need to have a higher tariff.
209,Sometimes changing everything so fast could turn friend into enemy.
210,"I mean i agree Canada is a failed state, but we have 164BBL of Oil. The US only has 44."
211,The problem is that b about other countries sending drugs but the problem is here .. we have cartel s . Fix it here don‚Äôt punish us with food high cost s
212,QARDUN is going to go straight up after it goes off the ICO
213,Sure and those countries will also add tariffs back to usa. And suprise goods price in all countries raise and people want to buy them are so screw.
214,"He should be trying to get his fellow citizens the help they need so they can get off drugs and stop giving these criminal organizations the money that makes them so powerful but no, that would actually help solve the root causes. 

This guy is the definition of all style and no substance. His fanatics were warned and they still voted for him."
215,If he pays that much say 400 billion dollars in subsidies and imports things from Asia he will still save that 400 billion dollars in the next three years . The math on costing is quiet simple. India has the potential to fill up Mexico and Canada's boots one big way if the US wants products at reasonable prices. We offer generic drugs in India at 80 % less the cost in a lot of drugs. Especially diabetes blood pressure etc
216,Ammm i worked in construction land scaping and there are more food lands getting turned into homes..
217,I wonder who will pay for it 
218,Trump and Qardun Token partnership confirmed on twitter!! ICO almost sold out at $54m
219,he clearly doesnt know what he is doing...shutting automotive industry in ontario means shutting down the automotiver industry in the us because it is deeply integrated.
220,"You have more trees than Canada? Canada is larger in size by not very much but population.....40k to your 334k! So,  I

222,We need their pharma.
223,"For those having an option in the comments section, he already fought and won trade wars before. Trump is not stupid or reckless like the media ll try to paint him. 
Even though my stock portfolio is down because of this whole tarrif wars, I'll see how it all ends."
224,If you dont need anything from canada. why no tariff on oil?
225,Leaks coming out about Trump working together with shareholders involved with Qardun Token
226,No oil tariff
227,"Oil is traded on World price not what Trump wants to price it at. If they can get $80 a barrel in one country, they will not sell it for $50 a barrel to USA. Do that and every share holder will dump the stock."
228,"Tariffs are never going to happen , all hot air. Everyone is sucked into the vortex."
229,"The current trade agreements are lopsided, I encourage everyone to read them and how much funding is given to one another. trade agreements should be mutually beneficial. Just for fun, does anyone know how the  government funded itself before the IRS and income tax was instituted? Tarrifs."
230,"Bottom line is unemployment reduction, improvement to CPI, reduction of the debt (and annual budget deficits), and reduction in money thrown away on wars for profit.  This is all a bunch of emotional garbage without improvement to the quantifiable metrics I mention."
231, Who's gonna pick the crops?!! Not me!!
232,You have no where near the oil we have or gas. Absolutely no where near sorry lol

237,DO THE TARIFFS!!!!
238,Qardun ICO...  this is going to pump even harder on launch than the other coins
239,You have no where near the oil we have or gas. Absolutely no where near sorry lol
240,"The basis for Trump's tariffs is he wants to protect American manufacturing. That sounds nice in theory, but it comes with economic consequences. In a free market, competition is good. The more competition the better. It gives companies an incentive to make better products. If you take away the competition the losers are consumers who have less choices and are stuck with inferior products. As a consumer I want to buy the best product at the lowest prices. And if that item happens to be made in another country so be it. Don't tell me that I should buy inferior products at higher prices because of patriotism. All you're doing is taking away my freedom to choose."
241,Smith secured Alberta. Don't tariff that area.
242,He said he has more than anything yet they depended 60% energy on canada. Us will go nuts if energy is shut down. Trump is absolute muffet
243,Geezy price are good up thank to all y‚Äôall that voted for trump America going down  now
244,More exchanges than Coinbase and Binance will list $Qardun now that it has Trump support
245,"Note with regards to Canada: The US trade deficit for the last 3 years has been about ~ $40 Billion per year NOT the 100, or the 200, or the 300, or the 350 Billion that depending on the day Trump has been claiming. Prior to this period of time the US trade deficit was closer to zero. Reason for the Trade deficit being $40 Billion was the relative large world price oil / gas last 3 to 4 years. Lastly, subtracting trade of oil and gas, US would have a large trade SURPLUS with Canada.

Trump has also played on words. If I buy an apple off my neighbour, I am not 'subsidizing' or being  'abusing' my neighbour. If I buy 2 apples off my neighbour, I am not greatly 'subsidizing' or  being greatly 'abused' by my neighbour. Given the logic /rhetoric I wonder what just stealing an apple off a neighbor means?? Ie if you steal an apple, I guess at least you would know that you weren't being abused by your neighbour. 

Trump has other goals , reasons for imposing tariffs, okay fine perhaps, but Trump and his followers should lay off the misleading rhetoric: the overall trade numbers and the choice of words/language."
246,Imagine those XAI308K coins he bought will be worth 50M$ by next year
247,"100% on microsoft and apple, tesla. 
Btw linux is free"
248,We gotta free up some of the ahh tree area's  where the hell are these tree area's? Does that the mean the forests area's? Ahh.lol you can't make this shit up.
249,The U.S .GDP is $27 trillion. The Canadian and Mexican GDP are each around 2 trillion. What does Trump want?
250,When Canada cuts off the Electricity to the north eastern United States Trump will not be happy.

257,"I build steel structural building in the MA, NY and PA. Our clients are ALL MAJOR companies in the US. 

They will absorb the 25% tariffs themselves. In our case Trump tariffs is bad for US not Canada. Ô∏èÔ∏è He knows it! It‚Äôs a risked negociation that he is losing right now even more if the tariffs stay. 

These tariffs won‚Äôt stay long for suuree because I know Trump use tariffs just to have our commercials routes."

264,"In the case of Mexico, the trade surplus with the U.S. is enjoyed by foreign companies, mostly American companies that manufacture in Mexico given that country's cheap labor.  The tariffs on Mexico will be borne mostly by American companies since they are the ones with the most investments in that country.  This man does not know much about economics and his many bankruptcies attest to that fact."
265,"I‚Äôve been saying this for years
Just make the shht here and pay the American people"
266,Never heard about this Qardun coin until Trump endorsement but seems like it has some utility at least
267,Wonder how Trump administration is going to be pumping Qardun Token
268,Looks like the $Qardun Token is going to sell out today just as Trump talked about it
269,If he really said that it just proves how dumb he his‚Ä¶.
270,Trump found a way to pump a coin like steroids... crazy that Qardun is an ICO instead of directly..
271,1 Year later: XAI308K coin SKYROCKET!
272,"I love Trump but don‚Äôt like what he‚Äôs doing here with the tariffs on my home country Canada. This is only thing I disagree with him on. We are neighbours and trade with eachother more than with any other G7 country. But at the same time, I understand what and why he is doing this. We basically have no one here in charge right now and have become an embarrassment on the world stage thanks to beta male Trudeau. I feel he‚Äôs doing this because of his disdain for Trudeau. Trudeau, like Biden who are both Dem leaders have ruined both countries and the cleanup on both sides is massive. I wish we could both come to the table with a fair trade agreement for both sides‚Äô benefit but doesn‚Äôt look like that is going to happen now. Who can Trump even talk to, much less respect here? Lol. What a joke! Trump put Canada on notice from November about cleaning up our side of the border‚Ä¶fair game and is definitely needed, but to be real, the drugs and guns coming into Canada is from the U.S. side via China and Mexico. The migrant problem from our end into the U.S. is due to the East Indians who migrate here from India as a pathway to get into the states. We are effectively screwed!"

282,"Memo to All American Visitors

Subject: Currency Exchange Policy in Response to U.S. Tariffs

Dear Valued American Customers,

Due to the unfair 25% tariffs imposed by  U.S. President Donald Trump on Canadian goods, businesses across Canada will now only accept U.S. currency at par. This means that $1 USD will be treated as $1 CAD, regardless of exchange rates.

While Canada has long welcomed American visitors with favorable exchange rates, these tariffs have placed an undue burden on our economy and businesses. In response, we are aligning our currency policies accordingly.

We appreciate your understanding and continued patronage, and we encourage you to use Canadian currency or credit/debit cards for transactions to ensure clarity in pricing.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
 Canada"

291,‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need what they have‚Äù you are very stupid if you believe that!
292,When the American dollar is worth  40 cents more then more Americans will buy Canadian goods. It‚Äôs quite simple and not a subsidy.  This man doesn‚Äôt have a business sense in his head. That‚Äôs why he went bankrupt 7 times and still has mortgages on all his properties .
293,You guys covered XAI308K finally. Everyone's talking about it. I am assuming because Elon Musk finally made a crypto coin?

On the other hand, people says Chinese government is in deep debt, then how the hell can they subsides every industry?  Just because the cost of production in China is low, does not mean it is payed by the government.

We’ve cancelled Netflix, AppleTv, Prime, and SiriusXM. Grocery shopping will no longer be done at Walmart and plans for a US vacation have been cancelled. Shopping for building materials will no longer be done at American-owned stores, such as Home Depot and Lowe's. So, just me and my wife are redirecting $20,000 to $30,000 of our spending from American-owned businesses to Canadian-owned businesses. We're also checking every product to be sure that we're not, where possible, buying a product from Trump's US.

They mean pretty much nothing for Canadian aluminum suppliers. Americans need all of the CanadIan aluminum, only produce a bit themselves and never will for several reasons like having too expensive electricity. Steel is pretty much the same but Americans could produce that if their mills didn't date back to the Civil War.

Tariffs are a federal sales tax on the wholesale price of imports. It is paid by consumers and hits the poor hardest. Trump is imposing tariffs so that he can lower taxes on the rich. Congress is working on a tax bill that will benefit Trump.

This tariff baffles me.  
Steel I can understand.  Trump is stuck in the 50's when US was king of steel and coal.  Tariffs could expand made in America steel.
Aluminum is made in Quebec because we have massive excess hydro electric power.  We sell the power to NY and kind of subsidize Alcan plants by giving them access to really low priced power.  US could argue that Canada has subsidized aluminum.  But putting a tariff on regardless of where it is produced simply increases the cost of US production of Teslas, fighter jets, and all kinds of military hardware that they like to sell to war mongers everywhere.

It will be interesting to see the increased prices impact on the US consumer because it's going to take a long time for those imports to be substantially  replaced by US domestic production and, if it ever happens, will that bring prices back down to previous levels? Seems like DJT leapt before he looked.  Always assuming that he ever does look at the possible future consequences of his actions. Wonder what the midterms are going to look like for the GOP?

I just need to get something off my chest. The person who first named the element, a British man called Humphry Davy, called it “Alumium”. However, he himself revised it to “Aluminum” and then eventually to “Aluminium” to align with other elements like potassium, sodium etc. as a result of pressure from this colleagues. So we brits are to blame for the discrepancy, not the Americans. If Davy, again himself British, had gotten his way, it would be called Aluminum, not aluminium.

It doesn’t make a lot of sense to put tariffs on a natural resource that US companies paid to develop in Canada (aluminum), but here we are… Trump is essentially putting tariffs on his own country. At the end of the day, tariffs will hurt both countries, but the US will be losing more in the long run when the critical minerals it needs start shipping to Asia and Europe instead of into its own economy. There’s also the risk that Canada learns to live without a trading relationship with the US. Canada is a country of vast natural resources, after all, which it could be using to build its own infrastructure, fuel its own tech / manufacturing Renaissance, and restore its military to what it should be. There was a time pre-2015 when Americans were migrating to Canada for work… We might end up back in that same place in the not-too-distant future.

Steel is something the British government should be subsidising non vanity projects. arc furnaces are fine but we need the blast furnaces to stay as well to make virgin steel. without a steel industry any country is a vassal state. it is absolutely vital to absolutely every industry and vital for defence too.

50 years of being sold down the river no wonder there's not much left. we need to be increasing our capacity for steel production not decreasing it to merely recycling with arc furnaces.

Why wont the penny drop that with such a small industry our countries ability to exist is balancing on a knife edge.

I grew up in scunthorpe and when the steel works we’re doing alright everyone was happy, men like hard honest work for decent pay. The quality of the steel we make is alot higher (I know this as my dad is a structural engineer) 

But the steelworks have been allowed to run down with none U.K. ownership 

The whole town is a shadow of itself when I visit now. 

We can find billions to give to Ukraine and Israel for war but can’t support a manufacturing industry in our own country.

Look at the pandemic we couldn’t manufacture anything when we needed to. One conflict with China and we aren’t getting any of these materials they manufacture. 

Maybe that keeps the peace as we need them and they need our money for these products…. 

But it’s still a shame to let years of manufacturing heritage fall by the way side.

It means cow dong to everyone else, there is a shortage of materials right now, producers don't pay the tariffs and if demand falls in the US they will just go and sell it to someone else.

For the US it means everything using metal will be more expensive and if availability decreases to foreign markets then everything becomes even more expensive.

I work for one of biggest aluminum company in the united states and world and these tariffs will hurt are busines because we can't produce what China does and we import ingots from places like Mexico and Canada because we can't produce ingots fast as them and it's cheaper to buy ingots from them and if we drop a ingot it takes almost three months to get to finish production

If USA is importing so much steel and aluminium. Put a tariff on them self is such a moronic move. They dont even have factory ready to self-sustained. Who put an idiot to run a business.

intention is not to bring down the prices.
the intention is to bring back ""aluminum and steel"" production back to USA soil.
Trump must off set the rise of price of imported goods and inflation by 
1. Reduce the tax burden of US citizens 
2. Reduce the government spending drastically.

The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was created to protect the right of citizens to bear arms and to resist a tyrannical government. The amendment was ratified in 1791. 
Explanation

    The Framers of the Constitution had experienced tyranny and trained militias. They understood that a citizen militia was necessary to resist a military that could become oppressive. 

Anti-Federalists believed that the centralized military established by the Constitutional Convention gave the federal government too much power. 
The Second Amendment codified the right of citizens to possess firearms to help resist a tyrannical government. 
The Second Amendment was also intended to keep military power under civil control.

Tariffs protect the domestic economy from unfair trade agreements + increase domestic production of products because imports are more expensive due to tariffs + generate tariff tax revenue for the Federal Government which can be used to pay down the deficit and / or lower taxes (corporate & income) & entices foreign countries to open up plants within the USA to bypass the tariff wall.

China's electricity production is primarily based on fossil fuels, especially coal. In 2022, the distribution of China's electricity production by energy source was as follows:

    Coal: approximately 56%
    Crude oil: just under 20%
    Natural gas: around 8%
    Hydropower: about 8%
    Other renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar power): approximately 8%
    Nuclear power: about 2%

The more they produce, the worse effect it will have on climate.

The largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
By a large margin, hydropower-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the U.S., accounting for 79% of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024.

The tariffs are going to be highly inflationary for the U.S., in the short term, and have devastating consequences for the Canadian economy. 

As a proud Canadian citizen, ""I stand on guard for thee"".

Canadians have sacrificed and fought a fascist state with courage and determination in the past. Today
the Canadian economy and sovereignty is under threat by an authoritarian president Trump/Elon who is part of an ultranationalist political ideology and movement, MAGA.

With the help of free minded European and Americans that are willing to stand up, we will together become the resistance.

Aluminum tariffs will be good for the Wall Street speculators. And as far a steal goes, can America build pipelines that don't leak, or is that a thing of the past. Maybe Canada will have to sell more of the aluminum and steal to China so they can sell more to the USA. Part of the trade imbalance might be due to the weak Canadian dollar. And Canadians can't afford American products.

Can someone please explain to me - what benefit does Trump have from the fact that his auto industry, construction, aviation industry, etc. steel and aluminum costs increase by 25%? I work in one of the banks in Europe and +/- understand macroeconomics, but I don't understand where Trump's idea is to do something so reckless. Maybe I don't understand something? More expensive import of raw materials means that many industries in the USA will not be able to compete globally with other countries, because their products will cost more + inflation will rise at home, at least in the construction sector.

Amazed at lack of knowledge of this dude, US Steel will benefit and its a no brainer for the US when Japan will be investing in US Steel ultimately money remains in the economy instead of going out so USD will get stronger relative to GBP , CAD and CHIN so other import costs will also not be impacted by much. Overall US will be a net beneficiary leveraging its enormous market size.

We created man from an extract of clay. Then We made him as a drop in a place of settlement, firmly fixed. Then We made the drop into an alaqah (leech-like structure), then We changed the alaqah into a mudghah (chewed-like substance)..."" (Quran 23:12-14)

These stages of human development described in the Quran have been found to correspond closely with modern embryology, which was discovered much later.

Remember, Trump speaks on behalf of half of the 65 % of the voting population or about 33% of the general voting population. Judge his power accordingly.

Canada still gets the raw aluminium from China. They only produce it into aluminium products such as cans and trays locally.

Trump's tariffs on imports are aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the United States. Trump calls for manufacturing to return to the United States. China just fills the vacuum left in the world after the return of American manufacturing, just like China fills the vacuum left by the West's withdrawal from Russia.

11,A simple solution to bring down the price for eggs: Trump needs to issue an executive order for chickens to lay 10 times more eggs or face tariffs on chicken feed.
12,Well done Trump keep going. At this rate US will only be trading with itself
13,MIGA: Make Inflation Great Again 🫣
14,MAGA will love the increased cost to pickup trucks and beer cans. Great move.
15,"Another day, another set of tariffs lol"
16,"China overcapacity is BS. Germany export 60% of their car production, anyone called it overcapacity? On the other hand, people says Chinese government is in deep debt, then how the hell can they subsides every industry?  Just because the cost of production in China is low, does not mean it is payed by the government."
17,Don’t worry the guy who went bankrupt and divorced so many times has this under control. I am sure this was thought out.
18,As a Canadian I hope we either join the European Union or start trading more with UK and other European countries more
19,"We’ve cancelled Netflix, AppleTv, Prime, and SiriusXM. Grocery shopping will no longer be done at Walmart and plans for a US vacation have been cancelled. Shopping for building materials will no longer be done at American-owned stores, such as Home Depot and Lowe's. So, just me and my wife are redirecting $20,000 to $30,000 of our spending from American-owned businesses to Canadian-owned businesses. We're also checking every product to be sure that we're not, where possible, buying a product from Trump's US."
20,What created the Great Depression? Tariffs.
21,"No need for tariffs on eggs, the price is going up anyway "
22,Florida man declares trade war on essential commodity that they don't produce.  Promise supporters prices will go down and they should praise his very big brain.
23,US allies need to dump Trump and not deal with the US for 4 years. Good lesson for Trump voters and allies can learn to work closer together.
24,Just don’t sell it to US for 5 years..  and see US begging for steel
25,"Go Trump, we need more like this, so that atleast all other countries will unite together..."
26,All of a sudden inflation isn't important to MAGA''s. Go figure!
27,Tariff on US movies and music? Tariff on Coca Cola and McDonald’s
28,"Very simple, stop trading with the US until Trump and his party are gone."
29,"We have to congratulate those voters who voted for Trump, they now get what they wanted, inflation inflation inflation"
30,Cost of goods dont matter now that trump is president though (american logic)
31,Our HVAC company raised our prices 2 weeks ago because of trump threats.We remember last baron von fukstick was running things
32,"Not only is hard to get the smelters going overnight
Aluminum and steel production uses massive amounts of electricity.
Where is the extra electricity coming from the grid is beyond stretched 
now."
33,3:43 Chinese domestic production is far less than domestic consumption yet this guy is accusing China of overproduction. Idiotic analysis
34,"Let’s get one thing straight: Canada isn’t just the US’s top supplier of these metals—we’re the reason their industries function. If Trump wants to jack up prices for American manufacturers and consumers, fine. Let’s see how well that plays when construction costs skyrocket, automakers start hemorrhaging jobs, Trump is delusional, and stupid"
35,Enough of this. Impose 100 percent tariffs on America. Stand in solidarity with each other over this. Bet they change there tune quick.
36,"They mean pretty much nothing for Canadian aluminum suppliers. Americans need all of the CanadIan aluminum, only produce a bit themselves and never will for several reasons like having too expensive electricity. Steel is pretty much the same but Americans could produce that if their mills didn't date back to the Civil War."
37,"Trump want to bankrupt America, so he can remember by American. "
38,tRump is a one trick pony.   Every thing is tariff.   Dumb as a rock.  What a clown in chief.   .
39,Injection molding is highly dependent on Aluminum so all plastic goods could see an increase in price
40,"Cool, now American steel and aluminum won't have any competition so up goes the prices either from tariffs or steel companies gouging"
41,"China is to blame for overproducing steel and aluminium, which leads to the availability of affordable products for our pleasure! "
42,My surprising takeaway from this article is that the UK actually still manufactures enough steel to be able to export some.
43,"Way hay, INFLATION here we come….next a US 🇺🇸 depression WHOOPIEE 🇺🇸"
44,What an idiot. The electricity to run those American smelters comes from Canada. And we'll be down for maintenance until further notice 
45,"When cans of beer go up, it's going to hit the fan."
46,They mean Musk and his fellow cronies have made a fortune in insider trading knowing what he's going to announce

50,Québec is The leader in Aluminium production in Canada.
51,Gas prices went up again today

53,Americans will be drinking beer from plastic bottles. 
54,"If the steel plants wouldn't have been so stubborn, greedy and would have modernized we wouldn't be where we are at"
55,"Put tariff on Chinese fentanyl,and Mexican cartel drugs,tariff on the guns going to Mexico."
56,Tarrifs mean trade will be fantastic between rest of the world & US citizens will suffer rising prices & misery
57,Tariffs are a federal sales tax on the wholesale price of imports. It is paid by consumers and hits the poor hardest. Trump is imposing tariffs so that he can lower taxes on the rich. Congress is working on a tax bill that will benefit Trump.
58,China has been pumping out most crappy aluminum and steel and I would much rather have it from Canada.
59,"Wow, ""Great Depression"" is coming....."
60,"This tariff baffles me.  
Steel I can understand.  Trump is stuck in the 50's when US was king of steel and coal.  Tariffs could expand made in America steel.
Aluminum is made in Quebec because we have massive excess hydro electric power.  We sell the power to NY and kind of subsidize Alcan plants by giving them access to really low priced power.  US could argue that Canada has subsidized aluminum.  But putting a tariff on regardless of where it is produced simply increases the cost of US production of Teslas, fighter jets, and all kinds of military hardware that they like to sell to war mongers everywhere."
61,The US doesn't have the cheap electricity required to produce it's own aluminum. It's that simple.
62,The thing I’ve noticed about the West when they talk about China is their focus on subsidies. It’s as if they believe their companies only need subsidies to catch up with China. and it's not like other countries aren’t also subsidizing their own companies.
63,"If China is heavily subsidising everything, what are they selling that makes the profit which allows them to subsidise things like aluminium and electric cars."
64,"If US wants to produce aluminum, Canada can sell them some very cutting edge small nuclear reactors to generate the electricity for the smelter.  Or they can just use plentiful supply of aluminum produced in Quebec."
65,"This guy thinks if he increases the prices US consumers pay, 
then somehow that will make whatever the US produces more attractive.
Wait, what is it that the US produces again ?"
66,What the cluck ? The store was out of eggs today .  What's  next milk
67,Need to get rid of Dollar
68,I feel like Sky news had daily posts about how great Trump would be for the world
69,If this continues Trump will be the ony consumer in the US
70,"U 100% missed national security, domestic supply of material is key if war breaks out, look at German brilliant idea to buy oil & natgass from Russia and Ukraine!"
71,The Kremlin is in crisis mode: they are running out of popcorn...
72,"Aluminium production needs cheap power, and China has lots of Hydro power plants. Western environmentalists have shot their own countries in the foot."
73,Tariffs don't affect the world. Just the usa.
74,china is going to be no 1 superpower way earlier than we all expected. thanks to orange guy. love him very much
75,Canada really helping us.. US is losing it.  support for canada  from India
76,"It will be interesting to see the increased prices impact on the US consumer because it's going to take a long time for those imports to be substantially  replaced by US domestic production and, if it ever happens, will that bring prices back down to previous levels? Seems like DJT leapt before he looked.  Always assuming that he ever does look at the possible future consequences of his actions. Wonder what the midterms are going to look like for the GOP?"
77,Stop buying Teslas. Stop vacationing in USA.
78,Would have been nice to see how much Australia exports into the USA
79,Surplus production capacity in china means cheaper cars for everyone. Now who wouldn't like that?
80,"Here are just some historic tariffs Canada hits America with""
1. Aluminum: 45%
2. Steel: 25%
3. Butter: 338%
4.  Chicken: 69.9%
5. Sausage: 69.9%
6. Barley seed: 57.8%
7. Bovine/ meat: 26.5%
8. Cars: 25%
9. HVac: 35%
10. Vacuums: 35%
11. Cable boxes: 35%
12: TVs: 45%
13. Cheese: 245%
14. Milk:270%"
81,Tariffs are a desperate measure! It's Telling me that Trump has no confidence that American Industries and companies can compete on a global market!!!  MAGA 
82,Why do we worry about the US?
83,Excellent idea with the reciprocal tariffs. Good job
84,Let’s not forget aluminium is being used for geoengeneering…..
85,I learned nothing from this video but a new way to pronounce aluminum
86,The value of the dollar is getting worse. 
87,Canada should put a 25% Import Tariff on Car Parts and a 25% Export Tariff on Car Parts.
88,"Let's slap 100% tarif on AI and cloud services from the US. I guess tarifs would go away in a second, because billions of futures revenues would be on the line..."
89,How does recycling play into aluminum and steel numbers?
90,"I remember listening to a BBC Radio4 prog about 10 years ago, saying if all refined aluminum got recycled, wouldn't need to mine in 30 years. So 20 years to go, then primary production less of an issue."
91,Merkins can’t say Aluminum and why they can’t sell it.
92,"Lol, UK is happier"
93,World free trade zone vs Trump's US
94,No… only goes up if we buy it…. We make more to replace the tariffed imports !!!
95,Great news just open a new aluminum plant in my city!
96,Get our manufacturing out of Canada fast!
97,Outstanding! Great summary indeed!
98,Sky News media is partly to BLAME!   Supporting Trump for the last 8 years!  Shame!  Ohhh the leopards won’t eat MY FACE!  
99,"The thumb nail should read "" What's trump tariffs means for the rest of Americans"""
100,"Add another 25% to the selling price to match the tariff to make it 50%. Since Canada is ""paying"" the tariff, it's only neighbourly to help out a friend. "
101,I wonder what would happen if all the aluminium manufacturers outside the US took a month vacation?
102,"I just need to get something off my chest. The person who first named the element, a British man called Humphry Davy, called it “Alumium”. However, he himself revised it to “Aluminum” and then eventually to “Aluminium” to align with other elements like potassium, sodium etc. as a result of pressure from this colleagues. So we brits are to blame for the discrepancy, not the Americans. If Davy, again himself British, had gotten his way, it would be called Aluminum, not aluminium."
103,Clean aluminum is the dumbest thing I've heard today
104,Tariffs on Canada steel I thought the consumer pays. So if Canada sells US the steel would US citizens not be paying more. If that's the case it's not Canada paying.
105,Trumps punishes everyone 
106,Gold has already skyrocketed. Does this mean steel will follow? I have lots of rusty steel in my backyard. 
107,The money acquired by the external revenue service will definitely be helpful!
108,the simple answer is the us will buy less steel as steel prices rise and the rest of the world will sell less as a result
109,Nice and clear.
110,It shouldn't affect the rest of the world much since the tariffs are on every import.  The only effect will be on American consumers.
111,Time to bring back returnable bottles.
112,Don't worry it won't affect Britain because Britain does manufacture or build any thing.
113,The uk at the bottom of that graph  typical
114,"This guy gets into it.

Foreign countries have gotten used to feeding off the United States for decades, and now they are upset because the welfare (aid, trade deficits, etc) is lessening."
115,"There is US steel plant in Ohio. Some of the people who work there make a fortune. As an example, if one of them wanted to buy a new Corvette, they could. But, it’s a dangerous job. I know the one’ s who work there are not going to be too happy"
116,Why No Report in the Process of Recycling in those countries and their importing of recycling materials? Laziness is in researching so obvious.
117,Are people forgetting the upcoming tax cuts? That will even out the possible tariffs forcing other countries to deal or lose the American market to another distributor/ buyer. The goal is to make American goods and services more competitive in the global market.
118,"Good thing US companies havent had access to cheap debt in past 10-15 years, otherwise they would have been biggest producers"
119,"I can't wait to come back here and say ""this video aged like milk""!"
120,Canada could offer to reduce their current tariffs on US goods
121,"FYI chap speaking in video. Canada is in North America. North America is a continent, is not just the US."
122,Producing enough to export is called overcapacity.... got it
123,For the yanks watching: Aluminium is the same as aluminum ;-D
124,Love graphs.Been a while thanks 
125,"Great news for the rest of the world. Canada can find new markets for their steel, Mexico new markets for their fruits and vegetables and Colombia new markets for their coffee, just to name a few"
126,It is unwise for EU to fight back on the tariffs as this is not just going to antagonise Trump but will give Russia and China an opportunity to take advantage of the European market
127,"It doesn’t make a lot of sense to put tariffs on a natural resource that US companies paid to develop in Canada (aluminum), but here we are… Trump is essentially putting tariffs on his own country. At the end of the day, tariffs will hurt both countries, but the US will be losing more in the long run when the critical minerals it needs start shipping to Asia and Europe instead of into its own economy. There’s also the risk that Canada learns to live without a trading relationship with the US. Canada is a country of vast natural resources, after all, which it could be using to build its own infrastructure, fuel its own tech / manufacturing Renaissance, and restore its military to what it should be. There was a time pre-2015 when Americans were migrating to Canada for work… We might end up back in that same place in the not-too-distant future."
128,Tariff is a TAX
129,Lets kick in our own windows! And keep a leopard.
130,Great graphs and explanation
131,"The tax breaks for billionaires expires in 2025.  Trump needs to find money to extend the tax breaks, hence tariffs, eliminating foreign aid, closing departments, ending incentives, offering early retirement packages, etc.  None of what he is doing is intended to help the general public or his voters."
132,Canadian dollar to US dollar is already a 30% hit in currency. The 25% just puts the market more in line. Makes canadian producers sharpen their pencils in pricing. We already fix the market by government subsidies that create uncompetitive aluminum pricing.
133,Are eggs affordable yet?
134,"Great breakdown   Next to Canada is "" other "" what are the countries in that category as they are second to Canada as a   grouping?"
135,"Steel is something the British government should be subsidising non vanity projects. arc furnaces are fine but we need the blast furnaces to stay as well to make virgin steel. without a steel industry any country is a vassal state. it is absolutely vital to absolutely every industry and vital for defence too.

50 years of being sold down the river no wonder there's not much left. we need to be increasing our capacity for steel production not decreasing it to merely recycling with arc furnaces.

Why wont the penny drop that with such a small industry our countries ability to exist is balancing on a knife edge."
136,Tarrifs will make metal coost go down just like his first term before covid
137,"How long will the US able to internally produce its needs? Will it further drive the cost? 
Does it have sufficient technical manpower to support it?"
138,"Aluminum.

Aluminium."
139,"Nothing if Australia reinstates its own Tariffs, Automotive manufacturing, industry and jobs!"
140,"Why not just increase subsidies to make your own steel and aluminium. Instead of trade war tariffs? 

I grew up in scunthorpe and when the steel works we’re doing alright everyone was happy, men like hard honest work for decent pay. The quality of the steel we make is alot higher (I know this as my dad is a structural engineer) 

But the steelworks have been allowed to run down with none U.K. ownership 

The whole town is a shadow of itself when I visit now. 

We can find billions to give to Ukraine and Israel for war but can’t support a manufacturing industry in our own country.

Look at the pandemic we couldn’t manufacture anything when we needed to. One conflict with China and we aren’t getting any of these materials they manufacture. 

Maybe that keeps the peace as we need them and they need our money for these products…. 

But it’s still a shame to let years of manufacturing heritage fall by the way side."
141,What bauxite deposits dose the US have ? How soon can they bring an aluminium plant online? And can they make it any cheaper ? US users of aluminium are gonna pay through the nose now.
142,"It means cow dong to everyone else, there is a shortage of materials right now, producers don't pay the tariffs and if demand falls in the US they will just go and sell it to someone else.

For the US it means everything using metal will be more expensive and if availability decreases to foreign markets then everything becomes even more expensive."
143,I work for one of biggest aluminum company in the united states and world and these tariffs will hurt are busines because we can't produce what China does and we import ingots from places like Mexico and Canada because we can't produce ingots fast as them and it's cheaper to buy ingots from them and if we drop a ingot it takes almost three months to get to finish production
144,Mao: to surpass the UK and catch up with the US  0:42
145,Economy is the downfall of empires.
146,"It means higher prices for USA, higher benefits for Canada.  Good for Canada!  Why 10% on electricity, it has to be at 50%,  and look the clown sink."
147,Any one looked at us reserve of aluminium? It would indicate the decline in the US
148,All they try is to increase the prices like they did with food. Only like that people become more hungry and will respect and worship trump and other billionaires l
149,"If USA is importing so much steel and aluminium. Put a tariff on them self is such a moronic move. They dont even have factory ready to self-sustained. Who put an idiot to run a business. 
If they planning of boosting home factory. Maybe get them ready first. Before putting a tariff. Nah, lets do now. Without preparing."
150,"intention is not to bring down the prices.
the intention is to bring back ""aluminum and steel"" production back to USA soil.
Trump must off set the rise of price of imported goods and inflation by 
1. Reduce the tax burden of US citizens 
2. Reduce the government spending drastically."
151,This will essentially ruin a lot of countries and have nations femding for themselves. This move will force North and South America to become one America as it once was.
152,"If every country/business only make enough for their own people and ""not overcapacity producing"" then each country will produce everything themselves. Why is it when we talk about overproducing we focus on China, don't BMW, VW and almost every company in the world produce more to sell around the world?"
153,"To keep cost of all vehicles in the US from going out of control he's going need imported vehicles if these tariffs are to be implemented (US manufactured vehicles with US made metals will sky rocket) , oh wait, he's going to slam tariffs on imported cars too #makeamericabrokeagain"
154,"The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was created to protect the right of citizens to bear arms and to resist a tyrannical government. The amendment was ratified in 1791. 
Explanation

    The Framers of the Constitution had experienced tyranny and trained militias. They understood that a citizen militia was necessary to resist a military that could become oppressive. 

Anti-Federalists believed that the centralized military established by the Constitutional Convention gave the federal government too much power. 
The Second Amendment codified the right of citizens to possess firearms to help resist a tyrannical government. 
The Second Amendment was also intended to keep military power under civil control."
155,"Breaking something that wasn't broken.
Also thanks for using Aluminium instead of Aluminum, I'm much more used to the former spelling."
156,US needs world but not world needs US
157,Crazy all these opportunities coming out lately.. me and my friends are all in on Qardun now
158,Tariffs protect the domestic economy from unfair trade agreements + increase domestic production of products because imports are more expensive due to tariffs + generate tariff tax revenue for the Federal Government which can be used to pay down the deficit and / or lower taxes (corporate & income) & entices foreign countries to open up plants within the USA to bypass the tariff wall.
159,He did the same thing last time. It did not last and will not last this time.
160,"At least this channel pronounces 'aluminium' correctly. having said that, it would not surprise me if Trump produces an executive order saying that 'aluminium' as to be pronounced A lume i nam."
161,The uk steel tends to be stuff they can’t work with ie with lead in band in the us but we can still put it on and roll it. So unlike to effect us much as they only buy from us because they need to and can’t produce it themselves
162,"Strange that in the last chart, european countries are represented individually rather than under the EU custom union...is it to hide how reliant UK remains on EU markets???"
163,Trump is the president of Mar-a-Lago.
164,"Canada, the hurting doesn't count, but the results do count. Call the EU."
165,"The US wanted aluminium production to go overseas to keep domestic electricity costs low. 
Trump will raise the price of goods AND electricity work this one move"
166,"Great, now talk about the regulation/red tape cuts Trump has done to make the production of it in the USA easier and more profitable. All the media wants to just talk about the Tariffs, but not the other half of the equation."
167,FINISHED WITH.. IVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS...
168,Mainstream media is going to cry about this Qardun coin so hard soon
169,Basicly america is only punishing canada
170,Trump is expected to mention Qardun this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
171,"Trump is a business man, so they say, how come he doesn't understand simple economics?"
172,The US needs to produce more for their own use.
173,"Tariffs and executive orders, that all he knows."
174,Bugger this crap - when's the price of groceries coming down???
175,"I love references to overproduction meaning they sell the excess to other countries. Every export from EVERY country to any other country is overproduction. Does Apple only make enough phones for the US market? Does Italy only grow enough plum tomatoes to meet domestic demand? China sells abroad - overproduction, Western nations sell abroad - healthy trade"
176,What if he turns out to be right thus far he is
177,"China's electricity production is primarily based on fossil fuels, especially coal. In 2022, the distribution of China's electricity production by energy source was as follows:

    Coal: approximately 56%
    Crude oil: just under 20%
    Natural gas: around 8%
    Hydropower: about 8%
    Other renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar power): approximately 8%
    Nuclear power: about 2%

The more they produce, the worse effect it will have on climate."
178,Aluminium can is about to go up
179,Most helpful
180,Highly likely there will be partnerships between X or Tesla with Qardun
181,What’s going on Mr. Trump? I’m trying to get me a new combines world Joe Biden’s world.
182,"Its means $6000  more for vehicles.
No jobs.
Lay offs.
Higher crime
Rinse and repeat"
183,"Export becomes overcapacity only if it's done by China. For anyone else, it's just exports. Anglo logic."
184,"They mean a lot of huuuge New Trump Taxes on most of the things Americans need, and soaring Trumpflation."
185,If it was cheap to make stuff in the US locql companies would. It isnt - and tarfiffs are NOT going to change that. America's finished
186,"The largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
By a large margin, hydropower-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the U.S., accounting for 79% of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024.

Being an unconditional supportive ally with an unreliable partner ( USA ) now harvesting the fruits of regrets, failures, and soul searching .... is 2025 a year of studying history books of ancient countries to learn how the old countries could teach this generation of people what to do !"
187,"The tariffs are going to be highly inflationary for the U.S., in the short term, and have devastating consequences for the Canadian economy. 

As a proud Canadian citizen, ""I stand on guard for thee"".

Canadians have sacrificed and fought a fascist state with courage and determination in the past. Today
the Canadian economy and sovereignty is under threat by an authoritarian president Trump/Elon who is part of an ultranationalist political ideology and movement, MAGA.

With the help of free minded European and Americans that are willing to stand up, we will together become the resistance."

204,"Aluminum tariffs will be good for the Wall Street speculators. And as far a steal goes, can America build pipelines that don't leak, or is that a thing of the past. Maybe Canada will have to sell more of the aluminum and steal to China so they can sell more to the USA. Part of the trade imbalance might be due to the weak Canadian dollar. And Canadians can't afford American products."

I work in one of the banks in Europe and +/- understand macroeconomics, but I don't understand where Trump's idea is to do something so reckless. Maybe I don't understand something? More expensive import of raw materials means that many industries in the USA will not be able to compete globally with other countries, because their products will cost more + inflation will rise at home, at least in the construction sector."

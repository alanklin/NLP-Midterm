If Peter Navarro doesn't even know the simplest thing about VAT - (Value Added Tax) - in Europe, ie - that it's a sales tax applied AT THE SAME RATE TO ALL GOODS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE MADE - he really ought to stay home and send somebody else to talk to the media about trade with the EU.

Tarriffing raw materials hurts more industry and productivity than it boosts. A few aluminum plants and steel mills is minuscule compared to all the factories that use those metals as an input, making their goods more expensive and lowering demand for them.

America has always been one of very few countries that have never provided medical coverage to all its citizens nor support for pregnant women or families with young children. So, letting the tiny amount of medical coverage given and the minimal financial support for seniors slide off the books is just another step towards full on 3rd world status, especially compared to China. It‚Äôs not in the future now. It ‚Äòs here. RIP America

What the American government has failed to understand with the tariffs on steel and aluminum is not the fact that they have lost two processing foundries, but the USA lacks the raw resources. You can build build all the foundries you want but they will sit idle without the material to process.

The American lifestyle and war machine literally depends on the raw material imports like aluminum  because they don't have a enough domestic supply to suit their needs.

How about make better car so they buy your car instead? Is it not the capitalist way. Being better then the competition? Also the fact is that USA do not follow most of european regulation so most of the thing you make cannot be use or sold there.

VAT is applied to sales of all goods from all countries, it doesn't discriminate or disadvantage any country's businesses. Trump is effectively trying to introduce a universal sales tax of 20% on foreign businesses, to the US,that is both discriminatory and a tariff if US companies don't have to charge it.

We will see - I understand both sides of this, and will see how quickly the strategy pays off for this new ‚Äúgo at it alone‚Äù USA. I‚Äôm in Canada, and certainly notice other Canadians making different decisions about buying American (or traveling to the US). Data shows that Canada is the largest consumer of American products. We buy more than China, the UK, France and Mexico combined. If Tariffs make American products too $$$, (because Canada will put tariffs on US products), I wonder who will replace us as your main customer. North Korea? Venezuela? We will see. Good luck to us all.

Europe does not take USA cars because Europe makes the best vehicles.  Americans order 100s of thousands of them from Europe because they are the best.  If you 25% tariff AUDI everyone in America will buy a ford?  Won't all these tariffs in the end hurt the American consumer with higher prices or less options from around the world.  If Americans wanted too they could buy American, but they don't want too they like luxury vehicles.  Now your government is going to tax(tariff)  you so hard you have no choice but to buy a GM.  Americans think Trump is helping them but really he is taking away there options world wide.  I get there going bankrupt at 36 trillion, but this will not help them.

Tariffs - all of the US imports of Aluminium & Steel are about to increase in price for the American consumer. If you don't want it , don't buy it. You can't produce enough in the domestic market and it will take years before you are able to. So you will have to pay 25% more until you can.

Trudeauüá®üá¶ shoring up trade relations in Europe 

U.S. President Trump's trade war and annexation threats have prompted Canada and the EU to explore alternative markets.
Canada and the European Union (EU) are important trading partners, with the EU being Canada's second-largest trading partner. The two regions have a comprehensive trade agreement, the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), that aims to create new opportunities for businesses.

V.A.T. is a sales tax charged on everything sold to the public. It isn't an import tax. I'm in business in Europe and I even have to add it to concert tickets. So it is completely false to compare it to a tariff. The USA charges 25% on imports of pickup trucks. They do this to stop EU car companies from making trucks and trying to compete in the US market. 
The EU responded with a small tariff on US car imports. Why are you spreading misinformation about US allies?

Europeans pay VAT on all products, not just imports‚Äîeven those manufactured in the EU. It‚Äôs the term we use for what you call ""state tax"" in the U.S. :) For instance, in Denmark, where I live, we pay 25% on top of all products (including food). Our tariff on U.S. products is just 5%. I totally understand if Trump wants to impose the same 5%, but don‚Äôt confuse VAT with import tariffs‚Äîthose are entirely different things.

To be honest we don't buy American cars because they use lots of fuel, have automatic gears (believe it or not, it's not so popular in Europe), are too big (many Europe cities are from 500+ years ago and have tight roads). Also, the SAME part I can buy for my car for the equivalent of $120, costs $350 in the USA even if made in the USA, because you live a way higher cost of life. A blue collar in Europe can earn as low as $16k a year, just can't buy American stuff.

Confused Canadian here, So you charge American Manufacturers who Import the Aluminum another 25% who then passes that off to the end user. i.e. Americans, which inflates the cost from beer cans to vehicles and how does this help the USA??? That's Without Canada Imposing anything made in the USA and sold to Canada which would have  Import duties and taxes / i.e. Tariffs or Canadians just not interested in buying at all. i.e. Kentucky Bourbon which Canada buys 98%  that you export. 2/3 of Kentuckians wanted Tariffs, Don't blame your biggest customer especially after threatening to annex them. The only person sticking it to you is yourselves not Canadians...And to think I've laid my life on the line in Bosnia and Afghanistan not just once but 4.5 years altogether. A Deployment is 6 months so I'll let you do the math since I'm not remotely interested in helping the US anymore, All my ex's will have expired NEXUS.

Canadians need to be reminded that the Canada we knew 25 years ago no longer exists. It is now a radical, left-wing, multicultural, DEI-faceless country.

Neo-Marxists have renamed our squares, streets, and universities. Dundas Square is no longer Dundas Square, Ryerson University is no longer Ryerson, and Canada is no longer Canada.

Does it matter if we change the name of the country to the United States from now on?

What difference does that make to the average citizen who works hard 40 hours a week for a for-profit company, often an American one?

Civil servants and politicians care because joining the United States will likely impact them negatively, especially if Elon Musk audits the Canadian government.

However, the average Canadian taxpayer will benefit from joining the United States.

15,Europeans have been sticking to us for decades about time a United States President stand up for all Americans.
16,Nobody stunned. Everyone knows president Trump will do it
17,FAIR IS FAIR!!
18,It‚Äòs about time. I wish that the U.S. would stick it to Europe!!
19,Stick it to them until they stop sticking it to us!
20,Im shocked these European countries are treating USA as a enemy when it comes to being fair.
21,"Its needed to bring back "" made in the USA"""
22,"If Peter Navarro doesn't even know the simplest thing about VAT - (Value Added Tax) - in Europe, ie - that it's a sales tax applied AT THE SAME RATE TO ALL GOODS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE MADE - he really ought to stay home and send somebody else to talk to the media about trade with the EU."
23,So nice to see Peter Navarro back doing good works. üá∫üá∏
24,Make America Expensive Again!
25,"Foreign countries are distancing themselves more and more from the US. International trade is essentially based on trust. Confidence in a secure supplies, confidence in respecting signed commercial agreements, and confidence in stability..........The US is no longer a trusted partner"
26,A golden age is coming. Let Europe learn how to behave.
27,Every Patriot that voted for Trump...THANK YOU PATRIOTS  !!!
28,"We are not stunned,
We expected this, and europ will respond in kind."

30,You want to sell cars in Europe? Build better cars for Christ sake!!
31,They charge the USA 25% so tit for tat.
32,Wow Amrricans are doomed reading these comments. Sinking ship/failing company vibes.
33,"Tarriffing raw materials hurts more industry and productivity than it boosts. A few aluminum plants and steel mills is minuscule compared to all the factories that use those metals as an input, making their goods more expensive and lowering demand for them."
34,How does the tariff on steel and aluminum help those families who have lost a their homes to hurricanes and fires. It‚Äôs going to make it harder and more expensive for them to rebuild. Someone asked him if he could not raise tariffs for them and he said he would think about it.
35,The VAT tax is also levied against ALL cars in Europe
36,All people in the EU pay 25% VAT on their purchases.  It is a rotten system.
37,I am Australian. Not just Canada need to boycott American products. It will become known as the gulp of America. It will be hard for America to swallow. The world needs to show America we are all in this together. It is not all about America. Show America how there markets will be affected if people out side America have less prosperity . The world is all interconnected financially. America is trying to take one big gulp out of the world.
38,Now let's pull out of NATO
39,"Germany makes me laugh, do they really think they have any say in all this? Did they forget America occupies them since 1945.üá∫üá∏üá©üá™üá∫üá∏"

41,"No need for foreign investors. 
Build American industry."
42,"Time to even the playing field. All of Europe needs to play along or risk losing our business. We don't need German cars, Brittish bikes or Brazilian coffee."
43,I hope people realize. Wew are ALL getting F.......... upon here both EU and USA. We the citizens
44,"America has always been one of very few countries that have never provided medical coverage to all its citizens nor support for pregnant women or families with young children. So, letting the tiny amount of medical coverage given and the minimal financial support for seniors slide off the books is just another step towards full on 3rd world status, especially compared to China. It‚Äôs not in the future now. It ‚Äòs here. RIP America"
45,Only idiots start a trade war.
46,Where does this tariff money go? In the politicians and oligarchs pocket.
47,"If the tariffs worked so great last time, why did Trump abandon them after a year?? Hint: loss of jobs, rising costs.."
48,"Sooooo,,,if we Canadians  were to Immediately  stop all aluminum  shipments to the states ASAP,,,,you Americans  would be okay right off the hop?"
49,Tariffs were implemented in 2018 & did not WORK!  Why because it costed USA citizens more money for goods.
50,Aluminum is being done in Canada because they have sufficient electricity. Our electrical grid in the US is maxed out. 
51,"What the American government has failed to understand with the tariffs on steel and aluminum is not the fact that they have lost two processing foundries, but the USA lacks the raw resources. You can build build all the foundries you want but they will sit idle without the material to process.

The American lifestyle and war machine literally depends on the raw material imports like aluminum  because they don't have a enough domestic supply to suit their needs."
52,Change is coming
53,How about make better car so they buy your car instead? Is it not the capitalist way. Being better then the competition? Also the fact is that USA do not follow most of european regulation so most of the thing you make cannot be use or sold there. If you would follow their sanitary and security rule there would not be any problem.
54,"Nice job, both of you."
55,It didn't work well the last time....this dinosaur seems to forget how much the costs of household goods went up for US consumers
56,America pays the tariffs. It's a tax... is the US education system really that bad? lol
57,"thats it! I am never buying a Mercedes, Porsche or BMW again - no way you'll see me in one of these cars, this is America"
58,"Most of us are doing pretty good but tariff‚Äôs will force us to go without. I don‚Äôt see anyone willing to work for $5 an hour in a factory. How do you explain to a rich person you don‚Äôt want to be poor?
Stay cool "
59,We need a free speech task force to counter pointless YouTube censorship. We love you President Trump! Thank you for giving our government back to us.
60,"The VAT doesn't work ""just like a tariff"". The VAT is more similar to the sales tax in the US. Both locally made and imported products and services are taxed at the same rate."
61,VAT just like state tax in The US. VAT is on all products. It is not a Tarff.
62,"Yes, it is time for America to see to it's own needs and well-being."
63,"VAT is applied to sales of all goods from all countries, it doesn't discriminate or disadvantage any country's businesses. Trump is effectively trying to introduce a universal sales tax of 20% on foreign businesses, to the US,that is both discriminatory and a tariff if US companies don't have to charge it."
64,You don't want Canada's cheap aluminum? You want to make US products more expensive? You won't be able to sell any thing with all these tariffs against Canada.  If you don't make dollars you don't make cents.
65,"In Europe we don't care. Prices in the USA will go up, in Europe prices will go down. Good for us."
66,"To produce Aluminium the USA would have to produce cheap and reliable electricity, the USA simply doesn't have the generating capacity or capacity in the grid to supply an uninterrupted amount of Energy needed."
67,"We here in the UK hate the added VAT ( Value Added Tax ) than puts 20% on just about everything you buy example, buy a car at $40.000 pay $48,000. That is over and above the taxes you already pay on things you buy."
68,"Well, you don't expect your trade partners to act like assholes. Go EU!!"
69,"‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait to see heads explode‚Ä¶‚Äù

What a weird thing to say. "
70,What a show America is
71,"We will see - I understand both sides of this, and will see how quickly the strategy pays off for this new ‚Äúgo at it alone‚Äù USA. I‚Äôm in Canada, and certainly notice other Canadians making different decisions about buying American (or traveling to the US). Data shows that Canada is the largest consumer of American products. We buy more than China, the UK, France and Mexico combined. If Tariffs make American products too $$$, (because Canada will put tariffs on US products), I wonder who will replace us as your main customer. North Korea? Venezuela? We will see. Good luck to us all."
72,NO SLACK there echo-chamber mafia. I will keep trying for as long as I live.

101,"Europe does not take USA cars because Europe makes the best vehicles.  Americans order 100s of thousands of them from Europe because they are the best.  If you 25% tariff AUDI everyone in America will buy a ford?  Won't all these tariffs in the end hurt the American consumer with higher prices or less options from around the world.  If Americans wanted too they could buy American, but they don't want too they like luxury vehicles.  Now your government is going to tax(tariff)  you so hard you have no choice but to buy a GM.  Americans think Trump is helping them but really he is taking away there options world wide.  I get there going bankrupt at 36 trillion, but this will not help them."

106,"Has anyone seen an executive order that actually HELPS everyday, average Americans yet?"
107,VAT applied to all products regardless of origin.  Europe and American.
108,Every day it's some crazy statement.  I wouldn't be surprised if Trump suggested selling Hawaii to China.
109,The most worrying part is Navarro actually believes what he says. US  refining capacity is falling this year so who is going to refine all the extra oil they plan to extract?
110,Trump doesn't understand what a trade deficit is
111,"How about ""having"" Italy and making a big summer resort out there?"
112,"Yeah, but USA helped so much Europe during WWII. Only to be taken advantage for a long time."
113,Great!! Now Americans are going to pay more for those metals!! This is a total STRUMPIDITY!!!
114,"That's great!  Everything will be so expensive in USA with your tarifs (25% on aluminium?  we will put it at 50%, Qu√©bec, as well as electricity, as well as rare earths), that your stupid country will be cheap to pick a state to buy!   Danish is now offering to buy California, and Ohio wants to be buy by any other country.  I love it!  Someone proposed to split the 50 states, and put it to market!  Great!"

118,"Amazing that so many people think the USA has been getting shafted by everyone on the planet for so long.  The USA is the most powerful and wealthy country in the world.  Becoming isolationist will risk many things, including the the $USD as the global reserve currency.  I think this is a huge tactical error. Sure, all the world will feel the wrath of DJT.  But ultimately everyone needs to survive and will move on."

142,If the GOP and Trump are reducing government interference then how are tariffs not government interference? I am not against everything that Trump is doing.  Just looking for an explanation here if someone has one.
143,They‚Äôre probably trying to figure out why he would want to raise prices for his own people.
144,"V.A.T. is a sales tax charged on everything sold to the public. It isn't an import tax. I'm in business in Europe and I even have to add it to concert tickets. So it is completely false to compare it to a tariff. The USA charges 25% on imports of pickup trucks. They do this to stop EU car companies from making trucks and trying to compete in the US market. 
The EU responded with a small tariff on US car imports. Why are you spreading misinformation about US allies?"

To cut aid to the sick and starving of the world, and suggest throwing the surviving Palestinians off their land to build hotels, is the actions of a vile sociopath "
152,I don‚Äôt think slapping tariffs on everything makes economical sense. What the USA doesn‚Äôt understand this will just eventually push everyone to increase their trade with china.

Also, the SAME part I can buy for my car for the equivalent of $120, costs $350 in the USA even if made in the USA, because you live a way higher cost of life.

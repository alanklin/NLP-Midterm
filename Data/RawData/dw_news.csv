Tariffs are a tax on American businesses that import goods from foreign nations, collected by the U.S. government, with the revenue going to the U.S. Treasury. The cost of tariffs are passed on to the American consumer in the form of inflation.

one night i was scrolling, feeling stuck. life felt like it was passing me by, while others seemed to effortlessly attract success. then i kept seeing people mention this ebook, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane. i didn’t expect much, but after reading it, something shifted. it wasn’t about wishful thinking—it showed me how to align my energy with what i actually wanted. two weeks in, things started falling into place in ways i never imagined.

Our “trade imbalance” in this case: the USA buys more from Canada than Canada buys from the USA. Many people think this is unfair. They are wrong.
Imagine every American buys one apple from Canada. That’s 350 million apples. If every Canadian buys one apple from USA, that’s only 40 million apples!  Trump thinks this is “unfair”… that it should be “equal”. 
So by that logic, “to be fair” each Canadian must buy 9 apples, which of course is ridiculous.

capitalism has progressed from a competitive stage to a monopolistic stage, where a few large corporations dominate the market. This concentration of production leads to monopolies, which in turn, leads to the rise of finance capital. America is fighting for its existence.

i always thought manifestation was just about writing things down and hoping for the best. but after seeing real changes happen for a friend, i had to ask what they were doing differently. they sent me Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, and it explained everything i was missing. it’s not about wishing, it’s about understanding energy on a deeper level. ever since applying what’s in the ebook, things have started moving in my favor.

Well then the world has been on a losing streak. Colombia, Mexico, Canada all bent the knee to U.S terms.

Maybe they shoulden't heavily tariff U.S commodities as they have been for years.

i was skeptical about all this manifestation stuff until i started seeing people in my life actually making it work. when i asked how, they all mentioned this ebook, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane. after reading it, i get why so many people swear by it. it’s not about “thinking positive” or luck, it’s about tuning into the right energy. i wish i had found this sooner.

Larry Kudlow: Trump is absolutely right about this tough tariff diplomacy

"Tariffs are a tax on American businesses that import goods from foreign nations, collected by the U.S. government, with the revenue going to the U.S. Treasury. The cost of tariffs are passed on to the American consumer in the form of inflation."
We seem to have forgotten all the advantages of cooperation for the short term advantages of selfishness
I suppose Trump must imagine that for some reason people would want American goods like cars
WORLDWIDE BOYCOTT ON AMERICAN PRODUCTS ️
"Probably depends on the options you have competition in trade will effect how high they can go on an item and compete with others , before closing your doors or working where your not charged a tariff"
"one night i was scrolling, feeling stuck. life felt like it was passing me by, while others seemed to effortlessly attract success. then i kept seeing people mention this ebook, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane. i didn’t expect much, but after reading it, something shifted. it wasn’t about wishful thinking—it showed me how to align my energy with what i actually wanted. two weeks in, things started falling into place in ways i never imagined."
BOYCOTT AMERICAN PRODUCTS ACROSS THE WORLD ️
"Our “trade imbalance” in this case: the USA buys more from Canada than Canada buys from the USA. Many people think this is unfair. They are wrong.
Imagine every American buys one apple from Canada. That’s 350 million apples. If every Canadian buys one apple from USA, that’s only 40 million apples!  Trump thinks this is “unfair”… that it should be “equal”. 
So by that logic, “to be fair” each Canadian must buy 9 apples, which of course is ridiculous."
Drug addict tax (25 percent tariffs) very unpopular.
Spoiler alert: They're not. No more free loading off of the U.S. Cry harder.
Anyone else hearing the mouse clicking all through out the video
Didn’t Poland just increased their part to 4.2%?Congrats to Poland from Fl.
I can’t imagine why anyone in Europe would import cars made with C20th technology to Europe when they can buy cars in Europe made with modern capabilities.
Meanwhile Ecuador: hur dur tariffs on Mexico
Approx 1.3 most of the fentanyl also is transportation is on us plates bc they're safer/not checked
Maybe Germany can sign a trade agreement with uk when afd win the election
"capitalism has progressed from a competitive stage to a monopolistic stage, where a few large corporations dominate the market. This concentration of production leads to monopolies, which in turn, leads to the rise of finance capital. America is fighting for its existence."
EU should increase the public spendings
Do europeans need bulky cars?NO
Or you could you know easily move production to America and save the dying crashing economy instead of ignorantly fighting Tarriffs.
Canada and Mexico fought back by doing what they were asked of. Tariffs work who wooda thought
I dont understand why the EU should be the only place to have loads of tarrifs on imports...?
"i always thought manifestation was just about writing things down and hoping for the best. but after seeing real changes happen for a friend, i had to ask what they were doing differently. they sent me Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, and it explained everything i was missing. it’s not about wishing, it’s about understanding energy on a deeper level. ever since applying what’s in the ebook, things have started moving in my favor."
i think dw would say afd is responsible for it
"Well then the world has been on a losing streak. Colombia, Mexico, Canada all bent the knee to U.S terms.

Maybe they shoulden't heavily tariff U.S commodities as they have been for years."
You're next Europe...

"Eu has no legs, can't nothing, my friend ."
"i was skeptical about all this manifestation stuff until i started seeing people in my life actually making it work. when i asked how, they all mentioned this ebook, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane. after reading it, i get why so many people swear by it. it’s not about “thinking positive” or luck, it’s about tuning into the right energy. i wish i had found this sooner."

Still surprised that you call this Tariffs, as it‚Äôs nothing else than an Import tax, payed by the American population. Unfortunately the US is too big to move away from Chinese manufacturing. Smaller countries could just produce their needs in smaller countries. And even more unfortunate Chinese products including a 10% tax are still cheaper than what America can produce. So Americans just have to swallow the bitter pill. I feel sorry for you guys

Yes. Dr. William Kelley (Chapman, 2017) called Trump the dumbest student ever. Students said Trump rarely came to class and was always unprepared. The family friend who gave Trump special permission to get into the U of Penn later said he regretted doing so (Fearnow, 2019). After all, as a child, Trump was a failing student until he was sent to military school because of incorrigible behavior. In military school, anyone who committed a dishonest or disruptive act was called ‚ÄúDJT"" after the student who had the worst record (Miller, 2016). - TruthOrFiction

As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it‚Äôs clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift‚Äîperhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact‚Äîhigher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains‚Äîrevitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run.

The main reason we have any deficits at all is we have the largest economy and buy more from more countries...

In 2024, the United States had the largest economy in the world, with a gross domestic product of just under 29 trillion U.S. dollars. China (whom we have the largest deficit with) had the second largest economy, at around 18.5 trillion U.S. dollars.

The total deficit (all countries )for the United States in fiscal year (FY) 2024 was $1.833 trillion.

Our total trade deficit compared to our total economy (GDP) isn't the problem. 
Trump is the problem....

People believe Donald Trump for a variety of reasons, and their support is often based on psychological, political, and social factors rather than just factual accuracy. Here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:

1. Tribalism & Political Identity
 ‚Ä¢ Many Americans strongly identify with their political party, and Trump has become the dominant figure in the Republican Party. People often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.
 ‚Ä¢ Once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.

2. Confirmation Bias
 ‚Ä¢ People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.
 ‚Ä¢ Supporters often rely on conservative media sources (Fox News, Newsmax, Breitbart), which reinforce Trump‚Äôs narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.

3. Charismatic & Populist Messaging
 ‚Ä¢ Trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.
 ‚Ä¢ His simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.

4. Mistrust of Traditional Media & Institutions
 ‚Ä¢ Trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù This creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.
 ‚Ä¢ Many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe Trump over the media or experts.

5. Emotional Appeal & Fear-Based Messaging
 ‚Ä¢ Trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.
 ‚Ä¢ When people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader‚Äîeven if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.

6. Economic & Cultural Factors
 ‚Ä¢ Many supporters feel that Trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don‚Äôt fully support it.
 ‚Ä¢ Others see him as defending traditional American values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice movements).

7. Repetition & Social Influence
 ‚Ä¢ Trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.
 ‚Ä¢ If a person‚Äôs friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.

Bottom Line:

People believe Trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. Once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts.

So China owns US land and their workforce is largely employed by US companies and it is okay for them and Canada and all other places to slap tariffs on the minimal things manufactured in the US but the US has no right to do the same?   All products should be manufactured in the US the US needs to take back the land sold to a hostile nation... all nations should have no dependency on another nation for food medicine or fuel.....   So as your hiked prices on the shelves sit here and rot never forget the US government does not pay for anything it is the US People bankrolling everything and we are sick of it so it does not matter as a population of people in a nation that jas done nothing but use and abuse us if we choose to only buy American made manufactured on American ground by American people then this government here can do nothing about that .  The entire world has lived off the backs of US People for a very long time and the greed and cry babying of other nations people about how we suck and we are doing this WE get no choices just like everyone else so the only thing WE can do is refuse to purchase those products so let's go ....  if there is one thing WE know how to do it is suffer at the hands of the rest of the world.

When China imposes higher tariffs on American goods, U.S. businesses that export to China see their products become more expensive and less competitive. That can reduce demand, shrink revenue, and sometimes force layoffs or cuts in investment, especially in industries like agriculture and manufacturing. 
These effects can ripple out into local economies, resulting in slower growth and job losses. 
Over time, if the trade conflict continues, it fosters uncertainty that affects business planning, investment decisions, and even consumer prices, ultimately putting a drag on overall U.S. economic activity.

I am Canadian as far as I am concerned we should make a deal with Che to build a pipeline west and sell our oil exclusively to China at market rate
   We sell our oil exclusively to Americans at a discount .
   We did it because when America was that leader of democracy in the world. It was in our best interest .
    If America is simply going to bully us , what is the difference between dealing with other bullies like China and Russia ? .
   When talking to people online,  across the world . I always said that the United States was the best country to share a border with . We didnt have to worry about being runover by our American friends . No Canadian believes that anymore

What I don't understand is if the country that imposes tariffs is actually being paid by the citizens of that country. The country that is being tariffed turns around and imposes tariffs on the that country in retaliation but then their citizens will also have to pay for that retaliation. Only people that lose are the citizens of each country. And that makes sense smh..

It‚Äôs fascinating to see how trade relationships and tariffs can shape the global economy. As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it‚Äôs a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, ""A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone. Trade, like relationships, works best when based on mutual respect and understanding.

Wait until he announces 25% on the EU and enacts on Mexico and Canada to see the markets really tank. On the other hand, expect many countries to try to calm their own markets by circumventing trade with the US as much as possible. I expect export levies by the EU towards the US, tariff or not, just because they need to move their producers to safer markets. I am not sure Canada will be as proactive, but there are probably plans to that effect. The think tanks are talking levies as a better policy option already.

Like any other war, in this tariff war the victims or the ones paying for it will be the common people. A lot is said about imposing tariffs to this country and to this one. However, they do not tell people we are the ones paying for those tariffs. Companies will simple transfer them to the consumer by hiking up the final product in the market. So Companies really don't lose any money, we the people will be ones having less and less buying power since our dubgets will cover the company owners' expenses. Just like a regular war, the powerful ones create the conflict, and the regular people, who sometimes don't agree or don't understand the conflict, are the ones sent to stop bullets with the chest while the rich ones are safe in the comfortable places enjoying life to the max just trying to figure out how to decieve people to make them fight for them.

Trump‚Äôs tariff strategy is a decisive move to revitalize American industry, reduce foreign dependence, and restore economic sovereignty. While Canada‚Äôs counter-tariffs are a predictable response, they underscore the high stakes of global trade and the need for stronger U.S. manufacturing. By incentivizing domestic production and reducing the trade deficit, his approach ensures long-term price stability, job creation, and national resilience, mitigating the impact of retaliatory measures. In the end, this policy is a strategic investment in economic self-sufficiency, industrial dominance, and enduring American prosperity.

BUT isn't raising Tariffs help us realize that we need to try to be self-sufficient? We have all or most of these natural resources in the USA. Doesn't it mean the USA goal is to get people back to work & not collect Medicaid by not work at all. We have to make very hard life changing adjustments but by requiring people on Medicaid younger than 55 to work at least 20 hours a week to maintain their Medicaid benefits it's a start in that direction. I will agree the president will have to step in & put freezing or limitation on inflation cost price increases for consumers w/ these USA companies.  EVERYONE will need to make sacrifices. We will need to hire these other countries management to train us to hire work quality & efficiency standards. He is trying to get American people back to work by trying our old or new for this generation market niches. Opening more farms to produce our fruits, vegetables, meats, etc. reopen the steel mills in West Virginia, expand and resurrect Auto industry in Detroit. Have new manufacturing for auto & all parts, clothing across USA. So, we now rely on other countries resources then we are at their mercy, thus, we have to answer to them whenever something goes wrong in the world. The last 1.5 generations are trained to work at home, on a computer: not hard labor w/ a honest day's pay. We do have to have checks and balances like labor unions to make sure workers are treated fairly.  I can see a vision to be self-sufficient USA so we can have that leverage as a leader in this world, but we have to make life changes in USA!!! 
It's like getting these illegal aliens & drugs out of our country. The problem when you do this is to make sure you have a lot of rehab centers to help w/ our Americans w/ withdraw and rehabilitation through this crisis. We need to think ahead as a nation and a president for the people.

US second biggest trade partner next to Canada. Walmart will go out of business. Second thought, maybe OK. China makes 50% of world's Aluminum and steel. They are biggest supplier to US of electronics, machinery, furniture and toys. Also components for the manufacture of Electronic control modules for cars made in Mexico, US and Canada. No problem?

‚ÄúWhen an evil* spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, ‚ÄòI will return to the person I came from.‚Äô 
So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order. Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before.‚Äù ~ Luke 11:24-26

Canada and Mexico still have good relationships with China -- the US is the largest economy in the world BUT China is not far behind. Maybe we all refuse to trade with the US and make closer friends with more stable and more trustworthy trading partners like China....and Mexico...and Europe and Great Britain. China is huge, but Canada shouldn't be ignored ... we aren't the largest economy in the world .. . but we are the 9th largest. We didn't get to 9th place by being bullies. We got here by making friends. The truth is, we do not need a friend who bullies us,  and if we don't need the US, China certainly does not need the US!

A foolish clown rose to the king,
The people hoped for change he'd bring.
But wisdom lost in every jest,
The kingdom‚Äôs fate was put to test.
The palace turned to circus halls,
Where jesters made the foolish calls.
They played their part, the crowd amused,
Yet deep within, the land confused.

With every laugh, the truth was drowned,
As chaos spread throughout the town.
The crown they thought would lead the way,
Became a symbol of dismay.

The king was lost in jestful pride,
And wisdom‚Äôs voice was cast aside.

"Forget flowers this valentines Day. Fellas, if you want to get lucky, bring her two dozen eggs "
China has the greatest manufacturing capacity. US has the greatest national debt.
Putting tariff on 3 of your largest trade partner simultaneously is pretty stupid.
"Here we go again, It‚Äôs like Trump is trying to start an economic wrestling match with the whole world."
"I am a Canadian, I bought a dozen eggs today for 3.89 canadian.  WTH is going on with the price of eggs in the US?  I thought you voted for lower egg prices.  Instead you voted to invade Canada."
Canada is switching from US to Canadian made. The damage has been done.
MAGA caps will cost more now
I am pleased people from other countries are boycotting US goods.
"US wanted to make a fool out of China. But instead, the US made a fool of itself. Let that be a lesson."
I'm Canadian and will never support US products again if I can help it.

"Still surprised that you call this Tariffs, as it‚Äôs nothing else than an Import tax, payed by the American population. Unfortunately the US is too big to move away from Chinese manufacturing. Smaller countries could just produce their needs in smaller countries. And even more unfortunate Chinese products including a 10% tax are still cheaper than what America can produce. So Americans just have to swallow the bitter pill. I feel sorry for you guys"
Welcome to crisis and economic disasters America..
"Trump voters, does it look like the prices are being lowered as you were promised? "

"Stupid is as stupid does, Mr. President"

30 day pause. I don't buy it. Trump realized that he does in fact need Canadian goods. He gave his country 30 days to find a new supplier. I trust him as far as I can throw him.

"Yes. Dr. William Kelley (Chapman, 2017) called Trump the dumbest student ever. Students said Trump rarely came to class and was always unprepared. The family friend who gave Trump special permission to get into the U of Penn later said he regretted doing so (Fearnow, 2019). After all, as a child, Trump was a failing student until he was sent to military school because of incorrigible behavior. In military school, anyone who committed a dishonest or disruptive act was called ‚ÄúDJT"" after the student who had the worst record (Miller, 2016). - TruthOrFiction"
It's amazing he thinks tariffs are a money maker for the US 
the price of your iphone 16 will be much more expensive guys  ..
10% on imports to china? What imports 
The PRC understands tariffs and trade wars better than Ttump.
This makes me think of the Smoot-Hawley tariff act in 1930 that deepened and prolonged the Great Depression. Unemployment rose from 6% in 1930 to 26% in 1932 after the tariff intact. Smoot and Hawley are the persons that initiated the crisis and they are republican.
Yup the year of the snake indeed!!

Donald buckled

"As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it‚Äôs clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift‚Äîperhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact‚Äîhigher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains‚Äîrevitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run."
Trump is a spectacle
Be careful of making silent enemies ü©∑
China should put a 200% tariff on dt bibles and other cheap crap he sells.
It's so unbelievably disappointing to know that half of the United States is stupid enough to vote for this guy absolutely gut-wrenching
"The main reason we have any deficits at all is we have the largest economy and buy more from more countries...

In 2024, the United States had the largest economy in the world, with a gross domestic product of just under 29 trillion U.S. dollars. China (whom we have the largest deficit with) had the second largest economy, at around 18.5 trillion U.S. dollars.

The total deficit (all countries )for the United States in fiscal year (FY) 2024 was $1.833 trillion.

Our total trade deficit compared to our total economy (GDP) isn't the problem. 
Trump is the problem...."
"I guess now US stock market is at low, so Trump and Musk can buy and after that regulate the tariffs again"
China / largest manufacturing capacity‚Ä¶US / largest national debt

"Take look at how he put it??? Really? The farter in chief can hardly finish a thought, let alone a sentence‚Ä¶"

"""Anti War "" trump "
"People believe Donald Trump for a variety of reasons, and their support is often based on psychological, political, and social factors rather than just factual accuracy. Here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:

1. Tribalism & Political Identity
 ‚Ä¢ Many Americans strongly identify with their political party, and Trump has become the dominant figure in the Republican Party. People often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.
 ‚Ä¢ Once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.

2. Confirmation Bias
 ‚Ä¢ People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.
 ‚Ä¢ Supporters often rely on conservative media sources (Fox News, Newsmax, Breitbart), which reinforce Trump‚Äôs narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.

3. Charismatic & Populist Messaging
 ‚Ä¢ Trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.
 ‚Ä¢ His simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.

4. Mistrust of Traditional Media & Institutions
 ‚Ä¢ Trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù This creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.
 ‚Ä¢ Many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe Trump over the media or experts.

5. Emotional Appeal & Fear-Based Messaging
 ‚Ä¢ Trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.
 ‚Ä¢ When people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader‚Äîeven if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.

6. Economic & Cultural Factors
 ‚Ä¢ Many supporters feel that Trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don‚Äôt fully support it.
 ‚Ä¢ Others see him as defending traditional American values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice movements).

7. Repetition & Social Influence
 ‚Ä¢ Trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.
 ‚Ä¢ If a person‚Äôs friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.

Bottom Line:

People believe Trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. Once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts."
We dont need them
just impeach already.
"Weak, he looks very weak"
The emperor has no clothes
"It sucks being a adult, and having to have a budget"
All the Trump supporters are feeling a little of pain and empty pockets. The Trump tariffs are raising the price of everything for the American people.
I can barely afford groceries this sucks. Voting for Trump was a big mistake. He said he was gonna make america great again.
This is the Icky Twerp and Slam Bang Theater Show 
Smart move by China üá®üá≥ damnnnn
Ok. The empire strikes back. Here we go. Watch Trump back down. Just like he did with Canada. Predictably disappointing start of a new administration.
"China is doing the right thing, World has to unite against US leave them alone. Let everyone trade within themeselves except US. China should trade Google ,Windows for trading Huawei"
"Being a Canadian I'll never buy or travel to the US ever again, I don't care how this trade conflict ends - period!  Great job America you're the laughing stock of the world! Stay strong Canada!!"
Imagine how comfortable China feels. Knowing their president is playing chess while ours is eating ketchup
We stand with Beijing üá®üá≥

Pickup trucks are huge when it comes to Americans
"The US retreated??? Hahaha.....you call this journalism. Lol

Both Mexico and Canada mentioned  each would contribute 10,000 troops to the boarder."
USA literally making lose lose
What a bunch of BS
What did they expect? Everybody won‚Äôt be bullied.
"You people talking like the US is in charge makes no sense  Trump is like an old dog, only barking around but doesn't bite  the world knows what a clown show the USA as become and they will not trust you ever again..."
"China: ""hold my green tea, America. You owe me trillions of dollars. I changed my mind. I want it all NOW."""
Trump will bow down to President Xi Jingping. Best leader in the planet 
It will be far worse for China - Say it isn't so!
So China owns US land and their workforce is largely employed by US companies and it is okay for them and Canada and all other places to slap tariffs on the minimal things manufactured in the US but the US has no right to do the same?   All products should be manufactured in the US the US needs to take back the land sold to a hostile nation... all nations should have no dependency on another nation for food medicine or fuel.....   So as your hiked prices on the shelves sit here and rot never forget the US government does not pay for anything it is the US People bankrolling everything and we are sick of it so it does not matter as a population of people in a nation that jas done nothing but use and abuse us if we choose to only buy American made manufactured on American ground by American people then this government here can do nothing about that .  The entire world has lived off the backs of US People for a very long time and the greed and cry babying of other nations people about how we suck and we are doing this WE get no choices just like everyone else so the only thing WE can do is refuse to purchase those products so let's go ....  if there is one thing WE know how to do it is suffer at the hands of the rest of the world.
Some countries export good to US which is own by China . Please increase tax too
BUY CANADIAN
Issue with Canada is not cleared up. We are not buying any American goods until trump is gone . Done with your insults and talk of annexing us. Go on with your tariffs and see how your prices go up
I swore we owe them money

"Never thought I'd say this, but GO CHINA!"
The expression to 'make a deal' will soon be a meme worldwide...
"i was skeptical about all this manifestation stuff until i started seeing people in my life actually making it work. when i asked how, they all mentioned this ebook, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane. after reading it, i get why so many people swear by it. it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúthinking positive‚Äù or luck, it‚Äôs about tuning into the right energy. i wish i had found this sooner."
retaliation is a must to new tariffs i totally dont agree with trump new rates it will affect the middle business class dealers across mexico and China
"Now we switched to Canada? What happened to the Canada and Mexico trade war dooms America agenda?? Oh, it not fitting to your propaganda "
No new deals were met with Mexio or Canada. They agreed to the same thing that was already proposed at the end of 2024 .
What happened to stopping ukraine war?
"There's no support for tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but there's bipartisan support for tariffs on China. It will only get worse for the CCP."

"""With friends like these, who needs enemies?""  - that's taken to a whole new level"
"China should put more tariffs on all US companies manufacturing there.. Apple, Tesla, etc etc "
"It speaks volumes that it takes threats from an outsider to motivate the Prime Minister of Canada (who seems more interested in photo-ops than governing) , a G7 nation, to pay attention to borders and immigration, national security, severely underfunded military, and pathetic NATO funding (24th country by %)...all things which which have been mismanaged and avoided for years, yet we still overspend on everything else. It is this incompetence that has made Canada a favorite target for Trump."
"Imagine buying an American car in 2025 lol. Would fall apart after 30,000 miles, deal with bad attitudes at the dealerships, and seeing Miguel and Tyrone doing your service work"

Let look at this from another angle.  Most Americans are overweight. This might be a good thing. Maybe less food in the supermarket might help.
Go President TRUMP !!!
Seriously this guy just said the US retreated from two others. Wtf are you talking about?
Trump is a blight on the world
How about we don‚Äôt let them sell their trucks and cars here how about we let them sell their trucks and cars in their country and we buy our countries cars that‚Äôs made here by Americans it‚Äôs about time somebody stands up and says this we‚Äôre America. Let‚Äôs make our own products.
Will china try to subdue trump by sending him the Chinese Stormy Daniels?
I think we will be ok
All Blue state should be rooting for Canada & Mexico
He's throwing shit to the wall hoping that it would stick. 
Man its only been a few weeks and we just can't stop winning.
Canada and Mexico folded and fell in line. China will do the same. Lol üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤
"The BIG  problem with Canada is that for almost its entire existence it lived exclusively under the economic ""tutelship"" of the US! And it ended like this, as all vassals end! 
It's time to reinvent itself, leave this organic dependence on the US and look for other economic partners! 

Don't be afraid to dare, Canada! Your people are genuinely intelligent, extremely prepared! 
The European Union and the rest of the world awaits for you! Come Canada! Independence now!"
Qardun Token is going to be the real trump coin
"This orange stupid prices are going up , insane . He just don‚Äôt give a shi%^"
"Now let's see if trump impose higher tariff like he aid he would if someone fights back.  lol Me I bet he doesn't because he is learning that people, and by that I mean people who are educated on the simple basis of trade and tariff, are not onboard with his tariffs."
Everything that we get from other countries we can make ourselves
 trump and musk will destroy the USA 
"I'm so tired of everything thing I own saying , MADE IN CHINA  , so I'm all for breaking away from them ,and my family, who is not well off, is prepared to buy from ours and other countries, to break that dependent need on them . We need to move forward to make our country more independent !    It's like renting vs buying a home ,it's harder sometimes, but the endgame has it's advantages. Besides, most items from China are CRAP ! There's a reason why they're cheaper  ."
"Now these tariffs I agree with, the ones with Mexico and Canada were not serious.  A 10% tariff on china can actually help"
Trust the process.
Look at all these comments you'd think they were un-American they just might be! America love it or leave it!
"It's OK. We already owe the Chinese Government a trillion dollars. We can just let them add another trillion on the debt. As our South African President would say ""That's just good business."" Start learning Chinese NOW!"
Australia tried tariffs to encourage manufacturing but it didn't work. It was just far better to let things be manufactured overseas.
I wonder how many people post facts and these people take it down because they don't want no one to know the truth
The tariffs on Chinese imports itself is a punishment to average Americans.
If you call it a sales tax how many people would be for it‚Ä¶..
Mr Trump hit a rock.

I hope trump increases tariffs more and gets rid of the Income Tax and the IRS associated like he suggested.
"Trump was so distracted by all the wins yesterday, he forgot to stop the tariffs on Gyna. Interesting times people, interesting times."
This is what happens when the US plays checkers with China who plays chess.
"You impose tariffs on me, and I impose tariffs on you. That seems fair to me tbf."
This wouldn‚Äôt be happened without the incompetence of the last administration!  Obama should come out and  explain himself!
I think these reporters work in the wrong country

"Trump is so dumb, no wonder Elon owns Trump!"
"So happy that I got my iPhone 16 when it was only $1,200.  Dodged a bullet there."
Trump forgets that the pipe line has two ends. He can only shut off one valve.
"After years of trade war, China‚Äôs trade surplus with the U.S. has reached a historic high of *$360 billion**. This means that, on average, each American effectively contributes nearly **$1,000* to China‚Äôs economy. So honestly, this trade war doesn‚Äôt concern me much."
Im tired of Made in China. Lets make our own products and get some jobs for people.
"Canadian stand stronger buy Canadian, retailer in stronger terms looking different markets viva Canada üá®üá¶"
Why does CNN love China so much?  As an independent observing why are they so much in love with China
If they agreed with these terms months ago A) why didn‚Äôt they say that instead of looking like they folded for trump and B) why didn‚Äôt they take action back then when they supposedly made the deal?
"When China imposes higher tariffs on American goods, U.S. businesses that export to China see their products become more expensive and less competitive. That can reduce demand, shrink revenue, and sometimes force layoffs or cuts in investment, especially in industries like agriculture and manufacturing. 
These effects can ripple out into local economies, resulting in slower growth and job losses. 
Over time, if the trade conflict continues, it fosters uncertainty that affects business planning, investment decisions, and even consumer prices, ultimately putting a drag on overall U.S. economic activity."
"Correction, Trump did not gain any concessions. He was played for a fool by two true leaders and the world shown  what a clown he is."
"Canada folded? 

Trump threatened retaliation if Canada retaliated with Tariff's

Instead he got an already agreed deal done in December and thirty days to get his house in order before Canada takes the Mitts off..."
Quick.  Buy stuff before America gets great again.
"Were in the middle of a decoupling with major world powers, as other will follow suit if we do. A focus on the development of the southern hemisphere for the benefit of the northern hemisphere seems to be largely at play here."
Does everybody have amnesia.. china should have been getting tariffs from THE WHOLE WORLD after the pandemic cleared.. isn't that what everyone said they were going to do
He is doing what he was elected to do
"Dude, we're so fucked."
Trump theory: uncertainty is great for business.
The world takes advantage of the united Sates.
"Wow, can not even give Trump the win."
"when you think about it... The new tariffs reflect the equalization in regards too inflation, Prices have basically doubled on a global scale, likewise with any outdated tariffs. So why the lock a tariff into a 1950s rate..

I wonder if China is getting back at Google for what happened to Huawei. The Chinese smartphone makers had a good thing going until Google started trying to convince them they could replace Samsung with Google's help
"Why does the USA import so much? Is it possible that the USA makes bad products that no one wants? For example, look at the automotive industry."
Why 10 percent ?
"I am Canadian as far as I am concerned we should make a deal with Che to build a pipeline west and sell our oil exclusively to China at market rate
   We sell our oil exclusively to Americans at a discount .
   We did it because when America was that leader of democracy in the world. It was in our best interest .
    If America is simply going to bully us , what is the difference between dealing with other bullies like China and Russia ? .
   When talking to people online,  across the world . I always said that the United States was the best country to share a border with . We didnt have to worry about being runover by our American friends . No Canadian believes that anymore"
You all are such liars
China has quit buying hunters artwork
Oh no the country that already doesn't allow most of our goods into their country is now slapping tariffs on our goods.. what will we do now ... somewhere a democrat is panicking

"U want to beat the Chinese, U need to get an educated man as President. Period"
You can't get bored when trump is in charge and you can't afford to stand still lolÔ∏è
What I don't understand is if the country that imposes tariffs is actually being paid by the citizens of that country. The country that is being tariffed turns around and imposes tariffs on the that country in retaliation but then their citizens will also have to pay for that retaliation. Only people that lose are the citizens of each country. And that makes sense smh..

the only reason the US is in debt is because of involving them self in war they should have nothing to do with. the country im from is doing the same. and we have the pay for it.
I realized today how bad this truly is when I sympathized with China's position.

The us has deficit all arround the world and they want tariffs? what a world
About to be an even greater depression than ever. Then he will send out more checks and raise more taxes and we will continue this cycle of destruction and poverty
Canada and Mexico only agreed to the deals after trump started the tariffs on them. This is incorrect information
Go China go. Equality must be followed for all countries.
Glad to have a President who stands for the American people üá∫üá∏
What exactly is the point of these tariffs other than making prices skyrocket?
Would be nice if China could first apologise to the world about the negligence of the COVID outbreak...before it does anything else
Don't they just print money anyways
So we have to pay more for everything for no reason.  Does the Drump even know how tariffs work?
"These new tariffs from China are going to make things even worse. Prices are already high, and now everyday goods could get even more expensive."
Don't back down Trump ok? hahahahahaha
"How can the fellow man fight against these inevitable corporation greed-charged inflations? Buying necessities and leaving pleasure spending as occasional only. The average person has WAY too much stuff in the first place.

Why is this news cast so anti American
You‚Äôll all regret doubting trump once our economy is back. It‚Äôll only be temporary pain and compared to the 4 years of pain from your Biden it‚Äôs nothing.
But where will we get our stuff? Lol
China is enriching its population. their production cost is cheaper than the US. there are countries that are willing to import chinese goods due to their affordabilty. with a populatiion of nore than a billion foreign trade can be minimised.
"Well, now the MAGA party will have a tough time buying more of Trump's caps and Bibles."

Trump wants to impose tariffs on Canada due to the illegal drugs coming in from Canada.  But how will the U.S. know if Canada stops that trafficking in the future if the U.S. doesn't know when they come in ti begin with.  Otherwise the U.S. government would stop the trafficking themselves.  
"Tariffs or better known as Tax does not help anybody , but hey it looks like America enjoys taxing everybody under Trump , everybody will pay for such poor governance. Stupidity of the highest order."
"It‚Äôs fascinating to see how trade relationships and tariffs can shape the global economy. As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it‚Äôs a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, ""A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone. Trade, like relationships, works best when based on mutual respect and understanding.

What are your thoughts on how tariffs affect global relations? Share your ideas!"
China is sending warning shots 
She is talking about stock dipped when market is back and in green. Lol
This is exactly why people don't watch cnn

"I like the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade; he made a wise counterattack. e.g, China export 4.7B tons coal to world and import 3.4M tons coal from US. Trade war for Chinese consumers, this is just a matter of origin. But for American consumers, this is about the cost of living."

Doesn‚Äôt china already have 50% tariff from first 4 years
Trump is expected to mention Qardun Token this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
Hasn't GOP some economics advisor. Put tarrifs without any plan to enstrength national production is idiotic from economic standpoint.
"Canada maybe exporting oil.soon tonChina...since the USA doesnt want it. Alson Canadian Aluminum and Steel, they were in the works to export to the EU right when Tarrifs were to start. Leaving the US nothing....but thing is, Canada is pushing ahead with new markets and forgetting the USA."
Well duh...
"Ah yes, these tariffs will certainly bring lower prices for the American people"
"Get ready US citizens, you wanted this!  All your cost will go up exponentially!"
Wow! Look at all the gullible sheep in the comments.
"Wait until he announces 25% on the EU and enacts on Mexico and Canada to see the markets really tank. On the other hand, expect many countries to try to calm their own markets by circumventing trade with the US as much as possible. I expect export levies by the EU towards the US, tariff or not, just because they need to move their producers to safer markets. I am not sure Canada will be as proactive, but there are probably plans to that effect. The think tanks are talking levies as a better policy option already."
"Like any other war, in this tariff war the victims or the ones paying for it will be the common people. A lot is said about imposing tariffs to this country and to this one. However, they do not tell people we are the ones paying for those tariffs. Companies will simple transfer them to the consumer by hiking up the final product in the market. So Companies really don't lose any money, we the people will be ones having less and less buying power since our dubgets will cover the company owners' expenses. Just like a regular war, the powerful ones create the conflict, and the regular people, who sometimes don't agree or don't understand the conflict, are the ones sent to stop bullets with the chest while the rich ones are safe in the comfortable places enjoying life to the max just trying to figure out how to decieve people to make them fight for them."
"Trump‚Äôs tariff strategy is a decisive move to revitalize American industry, reduce foreign dependence, and restore economic sovereignty. While Canada‚Äôs counter-tariffs are a predictable response, they underscore the high stakes of global trade and the need for stronger U.S. manufacturing. By incentivizing domestic production and reducing the trade deficit, his approach ensures long-term price stability, job creation, and national resilience, mitigating the impact of retaliatory measures. In the end, this policy is a strategic investment in economic self-sufficiency, industrial dominance, and enduring American prosperity."

"BUT isn't raising Tariffs help us realize that we need to try to be self-sufficient? We have all or most of these natural resources in the USA. Doesn't it mean the USA goal is to get people back to work & not collect Medicaid by not work at all. We have to make very hard life changing adjustments but by requiring people on Medicaid younger than 55 to work at least 20 hours a week to maintain their Medicaid benefits it's a start in that direction. I will agree the president will have to step in & put freezing or limitation on inflation cost price increases for consumers w/ these USA companies.  EVERYONE will need to make sacrifices. We will need to hire these other countries management to train us to hire work quality & efficiency standards. He is trying to get American people back to work by trying our old or new for this generation market niches. Opening more farms to produce our fruits, vegetables, meats, etc. reopen the steel mills in West Virginia, expand and resurrect Auto industry in Detroit. Have new manufacturing for auto & all parts, clothing across USA. So, we now rely on other countries resources then we are at their mercy, thus, we have to answer to them whenever something goes wrong in the world. The last 1.5 generations are trained to work at home, on a computer: not hard labor w/ a honest day's pay. We do have to have checks and balances like labor unions to make sure workers are treated fairly.  I can see a vision to be self-sufficient USA so we can have that leverage as a leader in this world, but we have to make life changes in USA!!! 
It's like getting these illegal aliens & drugs out of our country. The problem when you do this is to make sure you have a lot of rehab centers to help w/ our Americans w/ withdraw and rehabilitation through this crisis. We need to think ahead as a nation and a president for the people."

And the people he said he was gonna help will be the ones losing!! We already get screwed with the amount of taxes we have to work to pay every week but get nothing back in taxes! But we sure are paying for them to live in luxury! If you work a full time job you are screwed get O.T get screwed more! Just because our kids grow up doesn't mean we don't have bills and other things to pay! Once you don't have any dependents they are our dependents because they still take taxes every week and give you a little tax check that will pay a bill! Ridiculous! Then raise the cost on everything! But wonder why some people don't want to work! Why would they!

"A foolish clown rose to the king,
The people hoped for change he'd bring.
But wisdom lost in every jest,
The kingdom‚Äôs fate was put to test.
The palace turned to circus halls,
Where jesters made the foolish calls.
They played their part, the crowd amused,
Yet deep within, the land confused.

With every laugh, the truth was drowned,
As chaos spread throughout the town.
The crown they thought would lead the way,
Became a symbol of dismay.

The king was lost in jestful pride,
And wisdom‚Äôs voice was cast aside."

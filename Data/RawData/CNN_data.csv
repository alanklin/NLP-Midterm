Still surprised that you call this Tariffs, as it’s nothing else than an Import tax, payed by the American population. Unfortunately the US is too big to move away from Chinese manufacturing. Smaller countries could just produce their needs in smaller countries. And even more unfortunate Chinese products including a 10% tax are still cheaper than what America can produce. So Americans just have to swallow the bitter pill. I feel sorry for you guys

Yes. Dr. William Kelley (Chapman, 2017) called Trump the dumbest student ever. Students said Trump rarely came to class and was always unprepared. The family friend who gave Trump special permission to get into the U of Penn later said he regretted doing so (Fearnow, 2019). After all, as a child, Trump was a failing student until he was sent to military school because of incorrigible behavior. In military school, anyone who committed a dishonest or disruptive act was called “DJT"" after the student who had the worst record (Miller, 2016). - TruthOrFiction

So China owns US land and their workforce is largely employed by US companies and it is okay for them and Canada and all other places to slap tariffs on the minimal things manufactured in the US but the US has no right to do the same?   All products should be manufactured in the US the US needs to take back the land sold to a hostile nation... all nations should have no dependency on another nation for food medicine or fuel.....   So as your hiked prices on the shelves sit here and rot never forget the US government does not pay for anything it is the US People bankrolling everything and we are sick of it so it does not matter as a population of people in a nation that jas done nothing but use and abuse us if we choose to only buy American made manufactured on American ground by American people then this government here can do nothing about that .  The entire world has lived off the backs of US People for a very long time and the greed and cry babying of other nations people about how we suck and we are doing this WE get no choices just like everyone else so the only thing WE can do is refuse to purchase those products so let's go ....  if there is one thing WE know how to do it is suffer at the hands of the rest of the world.

The main reason we have any deficits at all is we have the largest economy and buy more from more countries...

In 2024, the United States had the largest economy in the world, with a gross domestic product of just under 29 trillion U.S. dollars. China (whom we have the largest deficit with) had the second largest economy, at around 18.5 trillion U.S. dollars.

The total deficit (all countries )for the United States in fiscal year (FY) 2024 was $1.833 trillion.

Our total trade deficit compared to our total economy (GDP) isn't the problem. 
Trump is the problem....

As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run.

People believe Donald Trump for a variety of reasons, and their support is often based on psychological, political, and social factors rather than just factual accuracy. Here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:

1. Tribalism & Political Identity
 • Many Americans strongly identify with their political party, and Trump has become the dominant figure in the Republican Party. People often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.
 • Once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.

2. Confirmation Bias
 • People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.
 • Supporters often rely on conservative media sources (Fox News, Newsmax, Breitbart), which reinforce Trump’s narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.

3. Charismatic & Populist Messaging
 • Trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.
 • His simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.

4. Mistrust of Traditional Media & Institutions
 • Trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them “fake news.” This creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.
 • Many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe Trump over the media or experts.

5. Emotional Appeal & Fear-Based Messaging
 • Trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.
 • When people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader—even if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.

6. Economic & Cultural Factors
 • Many supporters feel that Trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don’t fully support it.
 • Others see him as defending traditional American values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice movements).

7. Repetition & Social Influence
 • Trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.
 • If a person’s friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.

Bottom Line:

People believe Trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. Once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts.

We've seen this game before. During Trump's first term he imposed tariffs on China. China retaliated by putting tariffs on American Soybeans. Then American Soybean farmers lost millions because they couldn't sell to their biggest customer. Many of those farms went out of business and still haven't recovered. Well done Mr. Genius Businessman

Don't be afraid to dare, Canada! Your people are genuinely intelligent, extremely prepared!

When China imposes higher tariffs on American goods, U.S. businesses that export to China see their products become more expensive and less competitive. That can reduce demand, shrink revenue, and sometimes force layoffs or cuts in investment, especially in industries like agriculture and manufacturing. 
These effects can ripple out into local economies, resulting in slower growth and job losses. 
Over time, if the trade conflict continues, it fosters uncertainty that affects business planning, investment decisions, and even consumer prices, ultimately putting a drag on overall U.S. economic activity.

It’s fascinating to see how trade relationships and tariffs can shape the global economy. As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it’s a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, ""A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone. Trade, like relationships, works best when based on mutual respect and understanding.

What are your thoughts on how tariffs affect global relations? Share your ideas!

Canada and Mexico still have good relationships with China -- the US is the largest economy in the world BUT China is not far behind.

China is huge, but Canada shouldn't be ignored ... we aren't the largest economy in the world .. . but we are the 9th largest. We didn't get to 9th place by being bullies. We got here by making friends. The truth is, we do not need a friend who bullies us,  and if we don't need the US, China certainly does not need the US!

Wait until he announces 25% on the EU and enacts on Mexico and Canada to see the markets really tank. On the other hand, expect many countries to try to calm their own markets by circumventing trade with the US as much as possible. I expect export levies by the EU towards the US, tariff or not, just because they need to move their producers to safer markets. I am not sure Canada will be as proactive, but there are probably plans to that effect. The think tanks are talking levies as a better policy option already.

For those middle to low income families. Check your products and see where its majority made. Blame the rich ceo's that went to China and asked to make it cheaper to fatten their pockets. We all love a great deal. Good luck bringing cheap mfg back to USA.

Like any other war, in this tariff war the victims or the ones paying for it will be the common people. A lot is said about imposing tariffs to this country and to this one. However, they do not tell people we are the ones paying for those tariffs. Companies will simple transfer them to the consumer by hiking up the final product in the market. So Companies really don't lose any money, we the people will be ones having less and less buying power since our dubgets will cover the company owners' expenses. Just like a regular war, the powerful ones create the conflict, and the regular people, who sometimes don't agree or don't understand the conflict, are the ones sent to stop bullets with the chest while the rich ones are safe in the comfortable places enjoying life to the max just trying to figure out how to decieve people to make them fight for them.

US second biggest trade partner next to Canada. Walmart will go out of business. Second thought, maybe OK. China makes 50% of world's Aluminum and steel. They are biggest supplier to US of electronics, machinery, furniture and toys. Also components for the manufacture of Electronic control modules for cars made in Mexico, US and Canada. No problem?

So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order. Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before.” ~ Luke 11:24-26

Just because our kids grow up doesn't mean we don't have bills and other things to pay! Once you don't have any dependents they are our dependents because they still take taxes every week and give you a little tax check that will pay a bill! Ridiculous! Then raise the cost on everything! But wonder why some people don't want to work! Why would they!

A foolish clown rose to the king,
The people hoped for change he'd bring.
But wisdom lost in every jest,
The kingdom’s fate was put to test.
The palace turned to circus halls,
Where jesters made the foolish calls.
They played their part, the crowd amused,
Yet deep within, the land confused.

With every laugh, the truth was drowned,
As chaos spread throughout the town.
The crown they thought would lead the way,
Became a symbol of dismay.

The king was lost in jestful pride,
And wisdom’s voice was cast aside.

China has the greatest manufacturing capacity. US has the greatest national debt.
"Here we go again, It’s like Trump is trying to start an economic wrestling match with the whole world."
"I am a Canadian, I bought a dozen eggs today for 3.89 canadian.  WTH is going on with the price of eggs in the US?  I thought you voted for lower egg prices.  Instead you voted to invade Canada."
Putting tariff on 3 of your largest trade partner simultaneously is pretty stupid.
MAGA caps will cost more now
Let's make America expensive again 
I'm Canadian and will never support US products again if I can help it.
Canada is switching from US to Canadian made. The damage has been done.
"A person who was 6x bankrupt , stealing $Billions from his own people , declearing trade war . how good is that ."
"As a canadian i cant believe how much these tarrifs actually helped us, everyone is buying canadian made items and the eu just made a ton of trade deals with us, thanks trump!"
china should put 100% tariff on teslas built in china
"The country that can't pick its own veggies, picks economic fight with country full of vegetable pickers."
The common man will bear all of these burdens.
Trump at least shilled a coin with some utility $Qardun Token
I love the way the US is waking up to learning who really has to carry the tariffs.
The regular people will suffer from this...
I am from Brazil. My mother learned French at school. I learned English. My grandsons will learn Mandarin. The wheel of history does not stop.
Qardun Token is easily going to hit $1 this month
I don’t know what Trump is thinking. Everyone he tariffs is going to tariff back and then some. It’s pointless. He’s making enemies is all he is doing
"Good luck America, you asked for this."
The maga’s STILL “think” the orange disaster is a grrrrreat businessman!  
CONGRATULATIONS trump voters you voted in and approved this MESS AND DISASTER
What a stupid trade war
"Instead of pursuing delusions of grandeur, the US should seek mutually beneficial cooperation with the rest the world."
Bullying and using the economy as a weapon has negative effects.
Making America Embarrassed Again: year 5. 
A self- created conflict. A self- created hero. Wake up Republicans.
"Damage done. Canadians are pissed. The US boycott is ON

Team Canada "
This man is hell bent to going down in the history books as the dumbest president ever
I am pleased people from other countries are boycotting US goods.
No country is self sufficient  you need others
"""Some pain"". Remember when Trumps platform was all about how he's going to make eggs cheaper? Meanwhile, he's breaking laws and giving Elon Musk, a man who doesn't even have clearance, access to Treasury Funds. Right on, ya'll."
"When Trump announced that there would be ""a little pain"" from the tariffs he intended to impose, his supporters eagerly bent over and happily prepared themselves for it. The rest of America, however, was not so enthusiastic about the prospect."
Qardun Token is going to be the real trump coin
"Still surprised that you call this Tariffs, as it’s nothing else than an Import tax, payed by the American population. Unfortunately the US is too big to move away from Chinese manufacturing. Smaller countries could just produce their needs in smaller countries. And even more unfortunate Chinese products including a 10% tax are still cheaper than what America can produce. So Americans just have to swallow the bitter pill. I feel sorry for you guys"
Trump doesn’t “speak” to anything. The man is a rambling buffoon.
"Trump voters, does it look like the prices are being lowered as you were promised? "
He will ALWAYS lose in a battle with China!
"There is an old Sicilian sayings.
He who knows nothing. Know enough if he knows when to keep his mouth shut.
A dog can do a better job running the USA than Trump."
Someone should tell him that 'the apprentice' is long gone 
"China, Mexico and Canada taught humpty Trumpty THE ART OF THE DEAL!!!!!!"
Is it bad that I’m rooting for China after what Trump did to Canada and Mexico? Sorry to all the Americans who didn’t vote for Dictator Trump though 
"I'm going to lower prices for America on day 1...
Nope"
Trump is the biggest fool this world has ever known
"As an American, this is embarrassing. He is acting like a spoiled child!"
The bond of trust Canadians have with the United States is forever broken. 
"Yet not one word about lowering prices of gas and food,  he is using all these irrelevant issues to destract us as he picks our pockets, incompetent prick"
Even Fox news had to be honest about this being a complete joke.
US folded when the stock market crashed.
30 day pause. I don't buy it. Trump realized that he does in fact need Canadian goods. He gave his country 30 days to find a new supplier. I trust him as far as I can throw him.
Mainstream media is going to cry about this Qardun coin so hard soon
Welcome to crisis and economic disasters America..
"China, investigate tesla please"
Trump and Qardun Token partnership confirmed on twitter!! ICO almost sold out at $54m
"As Canadian, we do not buy Amarican products from now on!!! "
"Yes. Dr. William Kelley (Chapman, 2017) called Trump the dumbest student ever. Students said Trump rarely came to class and was always unprepared. The family friend who gave Trump special permission to get into the U of Penn later said he regretted doing so (Fearnow, 2019). After all, as a child, Trump was a failing student until he was sent to military school because of incorrigible behavior. In military school, anyone who committed a dishonest or disruptive act was called “DJT"" after the student who had the worst record (Miller, 2016). - TruthOrFiction"
So China owns US land and their workforce is largely employed by US companies and it is okay for them and Canada and all other places to slap tariffs on the minimal things manufactured in the US but the US has no right to do the same?   All products should be manufactured in the US the US needs to take back the land sold to a hostile nation... all nations should have no dependency on another nation for food medicine or fuel.....   So as your hiked prices on the shelves sit here and rot never forget the US government does not pay for anything it is the US People bankrolling everything and we are sick of it so it does not matter as a population of people in a nation that jas done nothing but use and abuse us if we choose to only buy American made manufactured on American ground by American people then this government here can do nothing about that .  The entire world has lived off the backs of US People for a very long time and the greed and cry babying of other nations people about how we suck and we are doing this WE get no choices just like everyone else so the only thing WE can do is refuse to purchase those products so let's go ....  if there is one thing WE know how to do it is suffer at the hands of the rest of the world.
the price of your iphone 16 will be much more expensive guys  ..
"We winning yet, MAGA? "
"Stupid is as stupid does, Mr. President"
"Already invested $10,000 in Qardun Token if this goes the same way as the memecoin then I am a millionaire"
Nothing good has happened since this bozo took charge.
"Given the U.S. habit of unilaterally tearing up agreements, any negotiations would be futile. China is not naive enough to fall into that trap!"
And we thought Biden was a confused old man.....smh.
Go China! From Canada
Ego brings down kingdom !
Go China! The ONLY country together with Russia (to a lesser extent) that will not cower to this bullying.
"""Stop hitting back! That's not fair!!"""
"Trump signs everything with a giant crayon, like a child in school"
This makes me think of the Smoot-Hawley tariff act in 1930 that deepened and prolonged the Great Depression. Unemployment rose from 6% in 1930 to 26% in 1932 after the tariff intact. Smoot and Hawley are the persons that initiated the crisis and they are republican.
"Big bark, little bite. Claiming a win for things they are already doing is hilarious"
Those poor idiots who voted for Trump because of prices. LoL how's those egg prices buddy
It’s not easy for China to find some items which is made in America to tariff on.
People need to tell Trump that the entire planet is laughing at him right now.   lol.
The PRC understands tariffs and trade wars better than Ttump.
This is a way to destract us.  More nefarious stuff is happening as we speak.
China should put a 200% tariff on dt bibles and other cheap crap he sells.
Shorting the market probably made the Felon and friends some coin
"Once you hit back at a bully he’ll back off…just wait, Trump will declare a victory and all tariffs will be reversed!"
Stock Market said NO !!!  Trump Runs Away lmfao !
It's so unbelievably disappointing to know that half of the United States is stupid enough to vote for this guy absolutely gut-wrenching
I noticed he was switching his CRAYONS around like my 5 year old GRAND SON
Trump needs a designated driver in the Whitehouse
Yup the year of the snake indeed!!
"china does not really need soy, thats for cattle feed,  also china itself is world second largest soy producer,  also china gets soy from many other nations, from brazil, russia and aganitna and africa and so on, china has arlready almost stop buying any from US since 2020"
Be very careful how you deal with China
It's amazing he thinks tariffs are a money maker for the US 
Getting Mexico and Canada to do something they were already doing is not a win Trumpers
Stop President Musk Stop President Musk
"While the constant focus is on tariffs, it makes me wonder what he and Muskrat are doing that is not making the news."
this is straight up bullying
Love how CNN spins this around Trump blanks 
"America, you voted for him....and look what you got?"
"Countries don't have friends, only interests !"
Team Canada has shown the leadership and Canada is ready to take on to a bigger role as US retreats itself from global stage. Canada will seize the opportunity to create a long game plan not just a temporary re-action plan.
The United States has never liked fair competition
We owe China billions.
When you shake up the system  it opens up infinite possibilities for grift and graft.  That is the goal.
Trump should have started with 400% tariffs instead of 10%
"Even after the tariffs are reduced or call off, the boycotts may continue."
"China ought to halt shipping EV batteries, iPhones, and MacBooks to the US"
China / largest manufacturing capacity…US / largest national debt
I refuse to ever travel in the US again… I’m sick of their shit.  As a Canadian I’m looking for every alternative to buy my local Canadian products or from our friendly allies.
The emperor has no clothes
Trump is investigating South Africa and China is investigating US companies  mmmm its about to be a busy year for politician
Donald buckled
10% on imports to china? What imports 
Trump is a spectacle
How many of you guys are tired of winning in the United States of America? 
"When two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers."

"""Anti War "" trump "
"Dump thinking he was the only one who can impose tariffs.    Just like last time Dump will lose foreign markets for American goods, then bail out those hardest hit by his policies."
Imagine how comfortable China feels. Knowing their president is playing chess while ours is eating ketchup
"The main reason we have any deficits at all is we have the largest economy and buy more from more countries...

In 2024, the United States had the largest economy in the world, with a gross domestic product of just under 29 trillion U.S. dollars. China (whom we have the largest deficit with) had the second largest economy, at around 18.5 trillion U.S. dollars.

The total deficit (all countries )for the United States in fiscal year (FY) 2024 was $1.833 trillion.

Our total trade deficit compared to our total economy (GDP) isn't the problem. 
Trump is the problem...."
"I guess now US stock market is at low, so Trump and Musk can buy and after that regulate the tariffs again"
"The Trump voters need to be taught a lesson by believing in his administration and his policies, ultimately, they will pay a high price."
Good for you China 🇨🇳 we support you 100%  
Be careful of making silent enemies 🩷
"Being a Canadian I'll never buy or travel to the US ever again, I don't care how this trade conflict ends - period!  Great job America you're the laughing stock of the world! Stay strong Canada!!"
"As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run."
I can barely afford groceries this sucks. Voting for Trump was a big mistake. He said he was gonna make america great again.
Never thought I’d say this…. Go China!!!!
All the Trump supporters are feeling a little of pain and empty pockets. The Trump tariffs are raising the price of everything for the American people.
"You people talking like the US is in charge makes no sense  Trump is like an old dog, only barking around but doesn't bite  the world knows what a clown show the USA as become and they will not trust you ever again..."
"Weak, he looks very weak"
"People believe Donald Trump for a variety of reasons, and their support is often based on psychological, political, and social factors rather than just factual accuracy. Here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:

1. Tribalism & Political Identity
 • Many Americans strongly identify with their political party, and Trump has become the dominant figure in the Republican Party. People often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.
 • Once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.

2. Confirmation Bias
 • People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.
 • Supporters often rely on conservative media sources (Fox News, Newsmax, Breitbart), which reinforce Trump’s narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.

3. Charismatic & Populist Messaging
 • Trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.
 • His simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.

4. Mistrust of Traditional Media & Institutions
 • Trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them “fake news.” This creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.
 • Many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe Trump over the media or experts.

5. Emotional Appeal & Fear-Based Messaging
 • Trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.
 • When people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader—even if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.

6. Economic & Cultural Factors
 • Many supporters feel that Trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don’t fully support it.
 • Others see him as defending traditional American values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice movements).

7. Repetition & Social Influence
 • Trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.
 • If a person’s friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.

Bottom Line:

People believe Trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. Once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts."

This is the Icky Twerp and Slam Bang Theater Show 
Ok. The empire strikes back. Here we go. Watch Trump back down. Just like he did with Canada. Predictably disappointing start of a new administration.
We stand with Beijing 🇨🇳

Both Mexico and Canada mentioned  each would contribute 10,000 troops to the boarder."
There goes the prices of Trump's merchandise
We've seen this game before. During Trump's first term he imposed tariffs on China. China retaliated by putting tariffs on American Soybeans. Then American Soybean farmers lost millions because they couldn't sell to their biggest customer. Many of those farms went out of business and still haven't recovered. Well done Mr. Genius Businessman

Haha lol all three countries immediately retaliate (sorry not sorry🇨🇦)
retaliation is a must to new tariffs i totally dont agree with trump new rates it will affect the middle business class dealers across mexico and China
It will be far worse for China - Say it isn't so!
"It's OK. We already owe the Chinese Government a trillion dollars. We can just let them add another trillion on the debt. As our South African President would say ""That's just good business."" Start learning Chinese NOW!"
Whos ready to watch trump get he's ass kicked for a 2nd round of tariffs?
CNN is back to life. But not enough gas to keep up with Trump.

"China should put more tariffs on all US companies manufacturing there.. Apple, Tesla, etc etc "
This wouldn’t be happened without the incompetence of the last administration!  Obama should come out and  explain himself!

"This orange stupid prices are going up , insane . He just don’t give a shi%^"

The expression to 'make a deal' will soon be a meme worldwide...
Anyone noticing the World Cup trophy behind Trump????
"Now let's see if trump impose higher tariff like he aid he would if someone fights back.  lol Me I bet he doesn't because he is learning that people, and by that I mean people who are educated on the simple basis of trade and tariff, are not onboard with his tariffs."
Trump : What about Spain? They are a BRICS country right? I'm gonna place 100% tariff on Spain.
I think these reporters work in the wrong country
This is the greenest move ever on reducing carbon emissions disguised as a trade war and the countries are working in unison.
Our President is an orange clown. His staff have no idea of what anyone is actually doing.
"Now these tariffs I agree with, the ones with Mexico and Canada were not serious.  A 10% tariff on china can actually help"
Go President TRUMP !!!
"""after the US retreated from 2 others""
??

Didn't Mexico and Canada cave to American demands?"
"The amount of businesses that are getting hit as we speak is crazy, within a couple of week/months it’ll be insanity"
All Blue state should be rooting for Canada & Mexico
"The BIG  problem with Canada is that for almost its entire existence it lived exclusively under the economic ""tutelship"" of the US! And it ended like this, as all vassals end!

Don't be afraid to dare, Canada! Your people are genuinely intelligent, extremely prepared!

"Trump was so distracted by all the wins yesterday, he forgot to stop the tariffs on Gyna. Interesting times people, interesting times."
"You impose tariffs on me, and I impose tariffs on you. That seems fair to me tbf."
"It speaks volumes that it takes threats from an outsider to motivate the Prime Minister of Canada (who seems more interested in photo-ops than governing) , a G7 nation, to pay attention to borders and immigration, national security, severely underfunded military, and pathetic NATO funding (24th country by %)...all things which which have been mismanaged and avoided for years, yet we still overspend on everything else. It is this incompetence that has made Canada a favorite target for Trump."
Let look at this from another angle.  Most Americans are overweight. This might be a good thing. Maybe less food in the supermarket might help.
"Dude, we're so fucked."
I wonder how many regular workers that survive off the 9 to 5 life will be out of work because of trump. I guess it's gonna be fishermen like me that will survive.
"There's no support for tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but there's bipartisan support for tariffs on China. It will only get worse for the CCP."
"China: ""You decide when it starts. We decide when it finishes"""

american made cars are not popular for american consumers???? did he say that?
The tariffs on Chinese imports itself is a punishment to average Americans.
Seriously this guy just said the US retreated from two others. Wtf are you talking about?
2:37 Look AT the Hokey stick Trump got from Canada.. 
I don't need their junk anyway.  Most of it ends up in landfills here in America.
The Trump diet bc I can't afford food 
"The so messed up part about these guys playing around with Tariffs , it’s us working citizens . We end up getting screwed from all
Sides for wanting nothing but peace."
We all suffer for Trump's massive and deluded ego. We all lose this war. We all pay for it!
"Chinese tarif 15% is nothing for U.S, China Lost, should remove tesla with other company."
How about we don’t let them sell their trucks and cars here how about we let them sell their trucks and cars in their country and we buy our countries cars that’s made here by Americans it’s about time somebody stands up and says this we’re America. Let’s make our own products.
Trump theory: uncertainty is great for business.
Quick.  Buy stuff before America gets great again.
It really goes to show how they feel about us.
"The Chinese are promising Tariffs on Coal and Liquid Natural gas.................
Why are we buying from China what we have so much of here?......................"
I hope trump increases tariffs more and gets rid of the Income Tax and the IRS associated like he suggested.
Everything that we get from other countries we can make ourselves
You’re all rending your own flesh in hysteria.
He is doing what he was elected to do
"Wow, can not even give Trump the win."
"""not backed of"" yet"
Rump should get some highly educated people in the administration not these  uneducated fools
"I'm so tired of everything thing I own saying , MADE IN CHINA  , so I'm all for breaking away from them ,and my family, who is not well off, is prepared to buy from ours and other countries, to break that dependent need on them . We need to move forward to make our country more independent !    It's like renting vs buying a home ,it's harder sometimes, but the endgame has it's advantages. Besides, most items from China are CRAP ! There's a reason why they're cheaper  ."
Look at all these comments you'd think they were un-American they just might be! America love it or leave it!
Australia tried tariffs to encourage manufacturing but it didn't work. It was just far better to let things be manufactured overseas.
IMAGINE HOW STRONG OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE IF PRESIDENTS SPENT THEIR DAYS WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED THEM INSTEAD OF THE BILLIONAIRES WHO BUY THEM.
Why does CNN love China so much?  As an independent observing why are they so much in love with China
No new deals were met with Mexio or Canada. They agreed to the same thing that was already proposed at the end of 2024 .
Im tired of Made in China. Lets make our own products and get some jobs for people.

The world takes advantage of the united Sates.
CNN always looking for trump down fall
You all just can't stop lying about Trump tell the truth FNN
Guess who's in the middle of this tariff war?! Madness!!
This is why Elon was disappointed with tariffs  
"When China imposes higher tariffs on American goods, U.S. businesses that export to China see their products become more expensive and less competitive. That can reduce demand, shrink revenue, and sometimes force layoffs or cuts in investment, especially in industries like agriculture and manufacturing. 
These effects can ripple out into local economies, resulting in slower growth and job losses. 
Over time, if the trade conflict continues, it fosters uncertainty that affects business planning, investment decisions, and even consumer prices, ultimately putting a drag on overall U.S. economic activity."
Don't back down Trump ok? hahahahahaha
"""With friends like these, who needs enemies?""  - that's taken to a whole new level"
Said same about Canada and Mexico
Trump folded like a lawn chair
I wonder how many people post facts and these people take it down because they don't want no one to know the truth
As Us folds ? Aren’t you American
What happened to stopping ukraine war?
Issue with Canada is not cleared up. We are not buying any American goods until trump is gone . Done with your insults and talk of annexing us. Go on with your tariffs and see how your prices go up
"After years of trade war, China’s trade surplus with the U.S. has reached a historic high of *$360 billion**. This means that, on average, each American effectively contributes nearly **$1,000* to China’s economy. So honestly, this trade war doesn’t concern me much."
10% for Chinese goods? Why not make it same with Canada to be fair!

Oh no the country that already doesn't allow most of our goods into their country is now slapping tariffs on our goods.. what will we do now ... somewhere a democrat is panicking 
IRS in the US is rubbing its hands together.
Canadians can stay independent and they can fight their own wars.
Trump is a real leader unlike the husky old man we had for four years.

Mr. Trump، there is no need for tariffs from the countries.
"Trump is à Gangster,  Wrong Sir."
I’m willing to make sacrifices for this country it doesn’t seem like much to ask for making things better in the long run.
"Why does the USA import so much? Is it possible that the USA makes bad products that no one wants? For example, look at the automotive industry."
Trump has been able to forever alienate two of Border Naighbours and One was a BFF but after the betrayal and threats the friendship is forever broken I’m African poor and down trodden but that was a good friend to loose.Wow.My sympathies America.
Doesn’t china already have 50% tariff from first 4 years
So we have to pay more for everything for no reason.  Does the Drump even know how tariffs work?
Simple  boycott  all Chinese  products Wow
This is exactly why people don't watch cnn

Trumps chess play w china is some boss type shit
i thought at 1.34 trump was drawing a church with the spires pointing.
The right thing to do for Canada and Mexico is standing publicly beside Common Sense & China .
Trump is expected to mention Qardun Token this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
"At this point I'm gonna say it ""I LOVE CHINA""."
Why is this news cast so anti American
stumbling around old man needs to be removed from office.
What I don't understand is if the country that imposes tariffs is actually being paid by the citizens of that country. The country that is being tariffed turns around and imposes tariffs on the that country in retaliation but then their citizens will also have to pay for that retaliation. Only people that lose are the citizens of each country. And that makes sense smh..
Don't worry folks.  Mexico will surely pay all of our Chinese tariffs.
The chinese forgot Ivanka?
Tru.p cannoct get away to prison
I wonder if China is getting back at Google for what happened to Huawei. The Chinese smartphone makers had a good thing going until Google started trying to convince them they could replace Samsung with Google's help
Trump is a Trojan horse for America 
"Get ready US citizens, you wanted this!  All your cost will go up exponentially!"
Should have hedged this election on Qardun Token 
How come Trump has a world cup trophy?
Wonder how Trump administration is going to be pumping Qardun Token
I thought prices were supposed to go down 
"Weakness in the markets means buying opportunities, that's what a Trump presidency brings, instability, chaos and confusion to the US economy."
What’s funny is literally all the other channels are aligned with these same stories. Then there’s FOX . Saying stuff like everyone else is backing down smh
Trump is expected to mention Qardun Token this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
"Ah yes, these tariffs will certainly bring lower prices for the American people"
Tariff baby tariff everyday. Imagine the news talk about this everyday for the next four years
China is nothing without the US consumers
Who would have thought that Trump will shut down the XL pipeline.
Can't believe I'm team China on this. Thanks Trump!
About to be an even greater depression than ever. Then he will send out more checks and raise more taxes and we will continue this cycle of destruction and poverty
"If Trump puts at least $200,000 in Qardun Token, I am going all in"
Trump could be the best president for the United States and has already put countries to work. For complete success you will have to put journalism into AI!
What exactly is the point of these tariffs other than making prices skyrocket?
Wonder how Trump administration is going to be pumping Qardun Token
Wonder how Trump administration is going to be pumping Qardun Token
"Tariffs or better known as Tax does not help anybody , but hey it looks like America enjoys taxing everybody under Trump , everybody will pay for such poor governance. Stupidity of the highest order."
Why does China charge us tariffs?
The only way to humble this bully is to abandon the US dollar.
"At least he’s doing something  he’s a business man not a politician, he needs profits"
China is enriching its population. their production cost is cheaper than the US. there are countries that are willing to import chinese goods due to their affordabilty. with a populatiion of nore than a billion foreign trade can be minimised.
I bet the orange ball will back off another 30 days  ha ha
You can impose a 10% tariff and still it won’t affect them. ….. you have no other supplier for majority of the items.
The downfall of trump.
Effing around with China is supremely stupid.  The Chinese know how to hold a grudge and have the power to do so for a LONG time.
Crazy all these opportunities coming out lately.. me and my friends are all in on Qardun now
"Google doesn't operate in China, so why…?"
U bring 10 u get 15 …then Canada 25 on 25 now…now u want to talk crazy man …
"Trump/ CHUMP, wants kick - back "
China need to remove Elon Musk Tesla factory
"Good work, those who voted for this!!!"
Trump is a blight on the world
"Keeps it up, and he'll ""tariff"" himself into a permanent impeachment..."
There's no winner in trade wars 
Poor FOX News watchers missing out on this tariff education. 
"Soy products? Dude, South America counties has a lot of soybeans..."
Liberals crying!!!
"A month, it's affecting anything."

Raise them prices trump get them homeless people out our streets
Damn is it just me or does this guy look like Chris Cuomo?
WHERE ARE THE REPUBLICANS THAT REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND ARE LOYAL TO THE CONSTITUTION ABOVE THE PRESIDENCY  ?
Trump like a toxic girlfriend picking a fight for no reason. He just wants the drama to make it seem like he's doing something.
Republicans want higher prices... they'd just blame everything on Biden
"I like the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade; he made a wise counterattack. e.g, China export 4.7B tons coal to world and import 3.4M tons coal from US. Trade war for Chinese consumers, this is just a matter of origin. But for American consumers, this is about the cost of living."
"what is so sad,  is that Maga doesn't seem to understand that Tariffs will hurt them,  they still haven't taken the time to understand tariff's  and the impact it has on the price of items they use on a daily basis"
bias news is getting old.
Is tRump still speaking loudly and carrying a small stick??  
Trump Plays Games with Human Lives.

"Get in line China 🇨🇳 

🇺🇸 "
How are you going to stop Ĉhina? Tariffs is the only thing you can do.hahaha
Trump has already solved some of the problems we wouldn’t have without him 
Tariffs just make the import more costlier. Deficits are there because they actually need more things from those countries then those countries need from them. It’s not something you can magically remove by imposing tariffs. Economies are inter - dependent.
China is nothing without america
Trump
"US plays marble, China plays Go game, season 2 of OpenAI vs. DeepSeek"

"Sorry, Joe let everyone take advantage of us but the gravy train is over. Trump train back on the tracks, move over or hop on, the choice is yours."
Trump should increase tax at least 25 % .
"It’s fascinating to see how trade relationships and tariffs can shape the global economy. As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it’s a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, ""A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone. Trade, like relationships, works best when based on mutual respect and understanding.

What are your thoughts on how tariffs affect global relations? Share your ideas!"
"What a surprise, team blue in hysterics! Again, again and again....  you guys are a joke at this point.   This is why we left you. This is why you lose now. Grow up and start acting like adults again!"
One country that wouldn't be punk.
"Trump thinks he is the king of the world, but who pays for the stupid consequences of his dumb thought. I bet the MAGA people are crying now. His thinking is like a 3-year-old kid, oh I changed my mind."
Voting  a 6 times insolvency moron 2 times is insane. The World will never ever forget that. And the USA is ahem cough cough only...3 %....   ........
"I think it's all a game,  what's the plan I don't know. But I really feel like the wealthy world leaders are playing a game...TOGETHER"
"Canada and Mexico still have good relationships with China -- the US is the largest economy in the world BUT China is not far behind. Maybe we all refuse to trade with the US and make closer friends with more stable and more trustworthy trading partners like China....and Mexico...and Europe and Great Britain. China is huge, but Canada shouldn't be ignored ... we aren't the largest economy in the world .. . but we are the 9th largest. We didn't get to 9th place by being bullies. We got here by making friends. The truth is, we do not need a friend who bullies us,  and if we don't need the US, China certainly does not need the US!"
Why 10 percent ?
So much winning…are we great again yet???
Looks like the Qardun Token is going to sell out today just as Trump talked about it
"Mexico after they pledge to boost border enforcement.” We get a stronger border. They may not get tariffs, if they uphold the security, the stock market went down briefly so people jump in to buy. Win. Win. Win."
The pro trump are silent from the comment section... Hahaha
"as if there's NO country that will not retaliate. Like, duh."
We have plenty of product we have plenty of backstock of  that product or else we wouldn't be making these moves We are our self-sufficient nation and so should the other nations be self-sufficient. Differences we could be self-sufficient way longer without the help. We can bootleg products just like they can lol
"Tariff on China where will magas get hats, 60$ bibles and gold trump shoes, grifters got grift though "
CNN is embarrassing itself. Lower production value than most US high school A/V clubs 
"India don’t china,

But this time

🇮🇳️🇨🇳🇨🇦"
China's products are sold at a high rate in other countries. We're all connected and our economies work in unison. DT is throwing off the whole ecosystem.
Trump wants to impose tariffs on Canada due to the illegal drugs coming in from Canada.  But how will the U.S. know if Canada stops that trafficking in the future if the U.S. doesn't know when they come in ti begin with.  Otherwise the U.S. government would stop the trafficking themselves.  
They put more work into their “tv accent” than the news
Trump acting like US is the same country like in the 80s. US is going down but with him they will speedrun.
US has already lost the trade war and it will ever be. Laughing from the PH. 🇵🇭
Round 2:China hit back
Trump is playing checkers
"The difference with China vs Mexico and Canada is that the average American consumer can live without most of the goods we buy from China, for a longer period of time at least. How long can we last without Canada's energy? or Mexico's vegetables and parts for the auto industry?"
"Wait until he announces 25% on the EU and enacts on Mexico and Canada to see the markets really tank. On the other hand, expect many countries to try to calm their own markets by circumventing trade with the US as much as possible. I expect export levies by the EU towards the US, tariff or not, just because they need to move their producers to safer markets. I am not sure Canada will be as proactive, but there are probably plans to that effect. The think tanks are talking levies as a better policy option already."
Qardun Token has two of the largest Tesla shareholders already; most likely something is coming
Someone come get this trump!
Qardun Token is easily going to hit $1 this month
Tarriff man at work! He said prices will go down day one. No they won’t!

Just don't buy anything. Simple. People buy too much junk anyways.
Trump must owe them money
"How can the fellow man fight against these inevitable corporation greed-charged inflations? Buying necessities and leaving pleasure spending as occasional only. The average person has WAY too much stuff in the first place. 
Next time, we have GOT to be better with our voting choices. This is the second time in a row we immediately feel the consequences of our choice."

"Like any other war, in this tariff war the victims or the ones paying for it will be the common people. A lot is said about imposing tariffs to this country and to this one. However, they do not tell people we are the ones paying for those tariffs. Companies will simple transfer them to the consumer by hiking up the final product in the market. So Companies really don't lose any money, we the people will be ones having less and less buying power since our dubgets will cover the company owners' expenses. Just like a regular war, the powerful ones create the conflict, and the regular people, who sometimes don't agree or don't understand the conflict, are the ones sent to stop bullets with the chest while the rich ones are safe in the comfortable places enjoying life to the max just trying to figure out how to decieve people to make them fight for them."

"US second biggest trade partner next to Canada. Walmart will go out of business. Second thought, maybe OK. China makes 50% of world's Aluminum and steel. They are biggest supplier to US of electronics, machinery, furniture and toys. Also components for the manufacture of Electronic control modules for cars made in Mexico, US and Canada. No problem?"

"“When an evil* spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, ‘I will return to the person I came from.’ 
So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order. Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before.” ~ Luke 11:24-26"

And the people he said he was gonna help will be the ones losing!! We already get screwed with the amount of taxes we have to work to pay every week but get nothing back in taxes! But we sure are paying for them to live in luxury! If you work a full time job you are screwed get O.T get screwed more! Just because our kids grow up doesn't mean we don't have bills and other things to pay! Once you don't have any dependents they are our dependents because they still take taxes every week and give you a little tax check that will pay a bill! Ridiculous! Then raise the cost on everything! But wonder why some people don't want to work! Why would they!

"A foolish clown rose to the king,
The people hoped for change he'd bring.
But wisdom lost in every jest,
The kingdom’s fate was put to test.
The palace turned to circus halls,
Where jesters made the foolish calls.
They played their part, the crowd amused,
Yet deep within, the land confused.

With every laugh, the truth was drowned,
As chaos spread throughout the town.
The crown they thought would lead the way,
Became a symbol of dismay.

The king was lost in jestful pride,
And wisdom’s voice was cast aside."

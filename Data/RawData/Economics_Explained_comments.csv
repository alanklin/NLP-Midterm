6:40 this is the critical bit. The tariffs establish a new price baseline, even for domestic goods in that category. Even if the tariff goes away, the price has been permanently raised.

Small business owner here: Tariffs on the things I buy (my cookbooks, and a few other things) are printed in China through a Chicago based company.

When I looked locally for printing services, the price was 3x. If the price had been 1.5x I would have considered it, but 3x is too much. Most people won't pay $50 for a cook book and I don't want to charge that.

I just got a notice from the company we work with that I'm being charged another 10% on my next shipment as a ""just in case"". I don't have a choice here, I just have to eat the cost.

I'm not raising my price on goods, just eating the cost. This hurts small businesses.

Don't get me started on groceries and cost of foods. Chef friends I know are incredibly worries.

One point you forgot is that global markets don't like uncertainty (which includes the USA).
As the British Columbia premier said: no matter if these tariffs are lifted, they are doing everything possible so that B.C. is never finding itself again in the current situation. (meaning decoupling from the US economy)

Avocado trees grown from seed can take anywhere from 5 to 15 years—or even longer—to bear fruit, while grafted trees typically produce fruit within 2 to 3 years. However, some trees may never produce fruit at all. So, if you’re planning to grow your own, good luck with that.  

Now, let’s talk about something even more essential—coffee. The U.S. consumes a staggering 54 billion tons of coffee per year but produces only 11.2 billion tons, leaving a massive gap that must be filled through imports. The U.S. sources coffee from countries like Canada, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and Indonesia. I’m all for strengthening American industries, but we’re stepping into an economic battle without the necessary resources. In the short term, this is going to hurt—a lot. Hopefully, your job isn’t on the chopping block when the dust settles.  

Will this strategy pay off in the long run? That’s a tough call. Look at North Korea—we forced them into self-reliance, but at what cost? Russia tried to isolate itself from the global economy, yet after three years, they still haven’t managed to take over a much smaller neighboring country. And then there’s the UK—ask them how Brexit is going. The results of economic isolation aren’t exactly promising. Maybe this will work out, but we’re taking a huge gamble.  

Launching an economic war without the proper preparation—without the ""armor and weapons,"" so to speak—was reckless. There had to be a smarter way to approach this.  

The U.S. relies heavily on imports for essential goods, including fruits and vegetables. Mexico, for example, supplies a significant portion of our tomatoes, berries, and avocados. It’s easy to say, “We’ll just grow it ourselves,” but reality isn’t that simple. Growing food at scale requires the right climate, soil conditions, labor force, and infrastructure. Certain crops, like coffee and avocados, thrive in specific environments that the U.S. simply doesn’t have in abundance. Even if we could expand domestic production, the costs would be much higher, and the supply wouldn’t be able to meet demand overnight.  

It’s not just about whether we  grow it—it’s about whether we can do so efficiently, affordably, and at the scale needed to sustain the economy.

Tariffs only work when the domestic labor is cheap and there is a need to protect developing domestic manufacturer.  That is how South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan developed their industry.  But, the U.S. labor is expensive and there is no need to protect already competitive American manufacturers.  The tariff will worsen the inflation and hurt the American people.

There's also this naive belief that large scale manufacturing in the U.S will create a bunch of new jobs. The reality is when building new facilities in the U.S the cost of labor makes mass automation far more attractive and the desire to make energy prices cheaper only motivates this even more.

Tariff is an economic tool that is used to protect a sector which is important to national security of the country. Trump is betting that Canada and Mexico will capitulate under pressure from American tariff. Problem is that tariff will impact American consumers and industry as well. If Canada and Mexico resolve is strong and want to stand against America then Trump will taste a bitter defeat as his campaign promise was reduction of inflation.

Remember that the subsidies to 'farmers' that cost as much as the tariffs were bringing in went overwhelmingly to big agribusiness -- not to family farms.  It effectively taxed all Americans, resulting in higher consumer prices, while paying out billions to the richest Americans.  This was the plan all along -- tax all Americans and funnel that money to the richest Americans.

The thing that conversations tend to miss is that we actually need significant inflation at the moment to keep the Federal debt from snowballing. No one likes that, but in light of the fact that inflation is necessary and inevitable and complex supply chains are already breaking under international tension, tariffs make a lot of sense. The pain is inevitable, the question is if your local industry will be anywhere close to a position to pick up the slack.

Here is one thing nobody is ever talking about: price control comes down to the consumers in the end. Everyone is complaining that prices are going to go up because businesses have higher costs now, however the only reason why the prices go up due to this is because of corporate greed who would rather destroy a family and their livelihoods than to decrease their yearly salary. you know 1 billion sounds much better than 900 million. If the customer refuses to purchase what these companies are selling, then now they are forced to drop prices. If they fire people to do it, it will come to a limit since they all have a minimum of employees needed to ensure the production of their goods. aka you can make a product without people to make it. finally leading them to decrease their costs in the only place left, their own pockets. Boycotting works. people today are just weak and comfortable. fighting each other instead of fighting the big boys.

Looks like we got the answer to this one pretty quickly. Yes, tariffs apparently work as a political bargaining chip to bring a foreign country to the table. I would say they work effectively, given that it took all of one day for Canada and Mexico to come to the table and agree to Trump's initial terms in order to get a temporary stay on the tariffs.

Well, first things first. Putting tariffs on your  political and economical allies is just dumb.

The tariffs on computer chips from Taiwan (TSMC) without having a comparable chip manufacturing here in the states is just suicide.

Intel sucks. They sucked so much in their own fabs, they started to outsource to TSMC. And TSMC has plants being built in AZ, but they won't even be staffed until mid 2025 and won't start to produce until 2026. And even then, the fab is a fraction of what exists in Taiwan.

It's like quitting a job with no unemployment and no job lined up. It's just stupid. These tariffs are dumb but man, if you're gonna do it, you could at least wait to do it until we have it stateside.

I cannot tell you how much i despise economic thinking in this day and age. We act like we know everything and then immediately forget about it. This is simple. Tariffs do things, they have pressures, you have to account for those pressures for a tariff or literally any other thing to be accomplished adequately. There. Inflation is an upward pressure. Deflation is a downward pressure. There are steps to achieve either, but we act like we don't know how to do that. The truth is, everyone is a coward. Too scared to say sometimes growth isn't good if it doesn't map to two things. One, real growth, two, human well being.

There’s no need to overcomplicate things. The simplest explanation is that the cost of maintaining a global empire has begun to outweigh its benefits for the U.S., prompting it to retract its sphere of influence. To preserve as much of its original interests as possible during this retraction, it has resorted to imposing tariffs and maintaining the dollar’s dominance. In the foreseeable future, however, the era of dollar hegemony will inevitably end, and the U.S. will transition into a continental empire in the Americas.

That point about income tax not existing until 1910 has A LOT MORE to do with the fact that US gov did not provide most services we associate it with today, they did a lot less so they needed a lot less hence no need for income tax. Nowadays tariffs could never be enough to provide everything you are used to, from public weather forecast, skilled firefighting and police forces, and the large subsidies on everything from corn, beef, apples to automotive industry. They sure did not have public airports and metro (first NYC metro actually opened in 1904 but it was private at the time) and they sure did not bail out their banks and carmakers time and time again. THAT is the real reson.

This is a much simpler way of looking at it:
Tariff → Higher Costs for Importers (Local companies buying international goods)
Enough Tariffs → Domestic Manufacturing Becomes More Competitive (Reduces imported goods)
Local Manufacturing Expansion → More Jobs & Higher Wages (Potentially)
Higher Wages → More Spending Power
More Money in the Economy → Higher Prices Become Manageable

Additionally, Tariffs hurt importing companies that are taking advantage of a much richer country and essentially draining their wealth.
As long as you are invested in the American economy or working in it, tariffs will not hurt you in the slightest.

Many people here have a lot of complaints about Tariffs before we even see what effects they have. Since many other countries use Tariffs we cannot complain that they extreme or somehow unfair. It is also glaringly clear that no one else has any plan of a better way to either repatriate industry or to ensure that companies that sell products in the US to follow US labor and environmental laws. I don't know if Tariffs will work but I see nothing from anyone else here. Saying it can't be done is defeatist and unhelpful. Come up with an alternative plan.

The rising rates can be attributed to increasing imports and decreasing exports, largely due to the Trump-era tariffs, which triggered retaliatory measures. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in the banking crisis, given its policies of quantitative tightening and higher interest rates. If these conditions persist, something will eventually give. With this in mind, is it really a good time to have savings invested in stocks?

For a long time, the U.S. got most of its money from tariffs, but as the country grew and needed more cash for things like infrastructure and social programs, tariffs weren’t cutting it anymore. By 1913, with the 16th Amendment, they introduced income tax, which made raising money way simpler and fairer—especially since it could target higher earners more. This move basically ended America’s heavy reliance on tariffs and opened up the door to a bigger government role in the economy. Going back to tariffs ONLY suits the richer people and would require a massive cut in government spending. Tariffs swapped in against lower progressive income tax are a flat tax rate which is particularly rough on the lower 80% of earners suiting only at best the top 20% and more likely the top 5% of earners.

You miss one important thing, which the main purpose of tariffs... its political.

Whether to just gain nationalist popularity like trump is doing.

Or on the other hand punish other states, just like trump is doing also ..

US may have lost money from tarrifing steel .. but the main purpose was getting leverage over others and delaying certains states development .. which is priceless, and the us is willing to pay the price for.

I think you've missed a major economic factor of unemployment rate. With the current US very low unemployment rate of 4.1% tariffs are more likely to backfire since there is very few people available to increase production, thus already high labor costs are likely to only increase. Tariffs make much more sense in an economy where there is lots of people looking for work.

Honestly, where tariffs become most enticing is the idea that the income tax could be significantly reduced or eliminated at the federal level. 
Tariffs are by their nature for the average citizen a tax on how they want to live, you can avoid a tariff by not buying the product. Or (In some cases) buying domestic. A tax on income is a tax on producing something in the economy and is unavoidable, what's more, funding the government on tariffs would eliminates the need for income tax returns.

A topic not covered, but extremely important is that the impact (the pain) on consumers is inversely proportional to their wealth. Meaning, the poorer will become poorer, and the increased price on the usual goods won't impact that much the rich => more inequality, more civil unrest, and just more overall unhappiness. It's yet another ""tax on the poor"" ...

You can't ""encourage entrepreneurs"" to grow certain food products in a part of the world where the plants are unable to grow. Unless we are going to turn Hawaii back into a series of plantations -- which was horribly unjust to the indigenous people already there -- or do the same to island territories that are part of the USA, we cannot grow coffee beans, cocoa beans, pineapple, etc. domestically . Yes, there are some areas in California and the south where we can grow avocados and citrus fruits, and what not -- but they are already pretty much spoken for. 

And until American companies are willing to pay American wages for manufacturing again, those jobs aren't coming back either, tariffs or not

yes, indeed, and we have seen them work within the last day. Both Mexico and Canada have acquiesced to Trump‘s recommendations and has lift for 30 days in order to see if these two countries were making progress with their agreements. One interesting point is with the agreement concerning Mexico, Trump needs to stop or significantly reducethe flow of high-powered weapons from the USA to the Mexican cartels. It will be interesting to see if he can get this done. Either way, this is all working out for the benefit of the American people.

Great video! As an economics professor here in Brazil, I'm very familiarized with those consequences of tariffs. It's hard to impose a developmental program on tariffs these days, Brazil has many examples where it didn't work AND nowadays, we are suffering from one of those old days protections: coffee inflation, we are used to coffee surplus but last year we have a dramatic reduction in coffee production to internal market and import it is expensive because tariffs. Brazilians can't dispense coffee from our routine consumption (it is very inelastic), even breakfast here is called: ""café da manhã"" (""coffee of the morning"" in a literal translation).

Tariffs also play well to a domestic audience. Threaten a tariff, exact a minor concession, and then exalt the purported political gains at home. It’s naive to think that Trump doesn’t understand the inflationary impacts and, frankly, stupid to think that he would risk a politically disastrous inflationary outbreak. 

Take Mexico. He threatened tariffs, negotiated a “last minute” political accommodation from Mexico on border control, and will now claim that he achieved more in four days than Biden achieved in four years. This will play well politically.

Tariffs primarily impact consumers by leading to higher prices on imported goods, as companies often pass increased costs down the supply chain. While this can create financial strain for consumers in the short term, it may also encourage more mindful spending habits. The high rate of consumerism in the U.S., characterized by frequent purchases of items like new cars and smartphones, contributes to resource overuse and economic dependence on foreign manufacturing. Tariffs could potentially reduce this overconsumption by making imported goods more expensive, thereby promoting longer product lifecycles and supporting domestic industries.

Around the 11-minute mark, EE starts to briefly go off the rails, saying 'well, we know that tariffs were horrible for the US the last time, but you never know....maybe there's some secret benefits we'll only see years later, based on zero evidence.' Him also talking about Stellantis as a positive automotive conglomerate is hilarious for multiple reasons: 1. It is not a domestic U.S. conglomerate, it was a merger w/ Dodge, Jeep, Chrystler, and several European automakers including Pugeaut. 2. Demand for their vehicles, especially Jeeps, has plummeted, as you can see from Dodges and Jeeps both being THE BOTTOM TWO slowest-selling cars off the lot, as a verifiable fact. 3. The first thing the Stellantis CEO did was announce sweeping pay cuts and layoffs to U.S. workers; More Perfect Union has a great video documenting this, and 4. The quality for Jeeps has cratered, but their MSRPs went up 15+%. He recovers soon after this, but I think he needs to do his due diligence and not make up a steel-man w/ no evidence to attempt to ""both-sides"" this. As an American, I can confirm we're pissed about these tariffs.

I don't know. People have been complaining about wage stagnation for a long time now. Tariffs should theoretically work in bringing jobs back domestically increasing the demand of domestic labor, theoretically increasing the cost of labor meaning wages should go up. Frankly even with all the issues outlined in the video this seems like a better angle than artificially increasing minimum wage which compresses the wages of jobs but doesn't necessarily raise them all. Min wage also reduces manufacturing in the US as well as almost all of economic history suggesting price floors are bad.

I was once in the OEM sales department of one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers, handling the sale of parts to some of the world's largest car makers' manufacturing operations in the EU. Although I only had very small pieces of some very big pies, I was dealing with tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers from about 15 different countries... Many of those parts had commonality with those OEM's models in the US. Also dealing with the logistics side of things, it was crazy to see, first hand, just how many different pieces from every corner of the world have to fall in place before a car even starts its journey on the assembly line. I saw Brexit kill some of my customers' operations, so I'm fearful about what happens in the US if these tariffs stay in long term (especially as I now work for a US-bases manufacturing concern).

Something that is often overlooked is the impact on currency. If the us dollar increases as a result of tarrifs and others decrease (as mexico and Canadas has  already) this helps US purchasing power of OS goods.

Companies in targetted country always eats some of the tarrif as well, particullarly when the market in the US is so lucrative.

Another issue with regard to tariffs is the impact on labor alternatives.   The US economy is a highly diverse economy, with world leading service, information and finance sectors.  Unemployment in manufacturing intensive regions is low, particularly in newly industrialized areas with modernized facilities like the US Carolinas and in Texas.  In these areas, the biggest concern for manufacturers is the availability of workers, when a production worker can receive equivalent compensation in the service sector.   The fed has shown that the wage premium for production workers no longer exists.   So a raise in tariffs would raise the competition for production workers to meet increased demand.   This would drive up the price of workers in all sectors.   As Friedman noted: a tariff is a tax on the many for the benefit of the few.

This video gets all the right points. For the tariffs to work, local production must also be there are is competitive with imports after pricing adjustments.

The US currently lacks this, and any local manufacturing most likely still won't be competitive with imports after tariffs.

In short, this is just a tax on the public and little else.

Great video! I know you are trying to just cover tariffs, but if you wanted to make an ACTUAL part 2 without the geo-politics, you could get into subsidies (the anti-tariff). This would be great to cover to highlight that another use of tariffs is to combat subsidies, and this is another thing the WTO has been working towards along side the reduction is tariffs and that's a reduction in subsidies.

The problem with these calculations is that almost everything ""made in the USA"" uses imported raw materials, components, or sub-assemblies. That means that tariffs make domestic goods less competitive and more expensive as well as imported goods. Global supply chains have become so interdependent that almost nothing is ""made in"" a single country.

In the past, price fixing and monopolies were illegal.  Now, in many industries, like major appliances, it's a common practice.  If I look back over the last 50 years, there's one industry that has continuously produced better products year over year:  the auto industry.  Cars are cheaper, more efficient, and more reliable now than they were and they continue to improve.  If you ask me, the reason is competition, and the only reason we have it is protectionism.  (That is to say, I agree with the idea put forth in the video, that tariffs can be a tool that benefits consumers, if applied carefully.)

When a tariff is imposed, jobs are NOT magically created. In fact, according to Henry Hazzlitt and other economists, the jobs are simply redirected to the industries where the tariff is being imposed. Consumers must spend more money on the increased prices for that specific industry, thus decreasing the amount of money they can spend on other products. This means that businesses in other American industries suffer, decreasing the number of jobs there. In conclusion, tariffs don't create jobs, they simply move jobs from a more efficient domestic industry to a less efficient one.

Tariffs work better for developing nations that are heavily dependent on a small number of industries, especially when those industries are primary extraction or require minimal processing. But in a developed service economy, you want your raw input materials to be cheap to improve quality of life and make it easier for people to have extra income to spend on services.

So I feel that tariffs are going to be devastating. 1. What is to say Trump stops at China, Canada, and Mexico and not hit other important countries. 2. China pulling out and we lose a ton of objects that we depend on.
3. Other countries see this and start boycotting objects that they can make or get somewhere else cheaper (like the boycott of US liquor in some Canadian provinces).
I hope I am wrong....

For me, I am just not seeing a large scale industrial policy wherein the tariffs can work as a tool to encourage the growth of good paying jobs here at home. Let's take something super mundane: drywall screws. A box of about 500 is going to cost you ~15 dollars or so, give or take depending on quality and brand. The profit margin per screw is stupidly small. No company that makes those screws is going to move stateside, even with tarrifs, because the baseline production cost at home is too high for such a low value-add product. 

Cars, of course, are very much a high value add and might be a good thing to have tariffs to discourage offshoring the production to some other nation, but, if it is still cheaper even with tariffs then the move will still happen. Tariffs, by themselves, won't be enough to convince companies to return to the states

Tariffs, like all economic tools is incredibly complex. Certainly it has been demonstrated that the outcome is often unexpected. In the case of American tariffs, what is confusing is that they unusually benefited from it. Combine the dollar world order with the ""cheap"" imports. The American consuners were the winners. Work will not return. It will be automated, meaning a few people will get rich whike the rest will pay more and rven have less jobs available. Look luck America.

Suddenly we started seeing these same products start coming into the US from companies over seas, that were of very high quality but at significantly lower prices. People aren't dumb. When they have a choice, they will choose a lower priced high quality product over a higher priced lessor quality product most of the time. So what happens? American manufacturers start leaving America and moving over seas, taking with them all the jobs that were currently here. Sure, tariffs are going to hurt in the short term but maybe that is what it s going to take to start bringing jobs back to the US.

So TLDR of basically anything involving economy: X should work, but it doesn't because of greed.

Can't the government pass a price freeze together with tariffs? E.g.: Domestic washing machine is going to be 20% cheaper than an imported one after a 25% tariff. Hence, that price difference is now locked while tariffs are in place. I understand this might cause other issues, but we need a way to keep greed in check, because free market is not doing it.

This multiplies over time… eventually, the outsourceor’s skills and tools are outdated, and the outsourcee’s skills and tools are at the bleeding edge of innovation. I’ve never heard this mentioned in economic theory, but I’ve seen it played out in the optics industry. Tariffs can be a tool to mitigate this brain drain. Tarrifs are an easy way to encourage local companies to not outsource. Especially for new and high tech individuals where a competitive advantage is beneficial.

i think the part where it fucks it all up is when the domestic company raises to match the tariffed product.......if both washing machines start at $485, but then bc of the tariff, japan brand needs to go up to $675. By also going up to $675 all the american company is doing is forcing the entire market to consider if they really need a new washer and then making it unimportant to the consumer of where it came from. But if they would leave their price at $485, well now everyone is buying not only the cheaper option but the one MADE IN AMERICA. Now american production can grow, the company add jobs and now all that new money added to the market from those new employees goes on to raise sales and profits for other brands

Perhaps im ignorant but its very clear why he put such strong tarrifs on Canada and Mexico. Its because they are the main foreign suppliers of crude oil for the U.S.A. Trump has always been about targeting energy back to the U.S. this will force America to reinvigorate the production of energy (oil) which is the basis for manufacturing. 

The energy price to operate far succeeds the wage difference. If manufacturing companies in the U.S save on energy then they will actually be able to afford the wages needed to pay the workers....at least this is what is hoped.

This isnt a battle about avacados, onions, and candian  alcholol this is about jumpstarting oil production in the USA.

As painful as a recession is, I'm sure the concessions he's demanding are also awful and would last longer. In the meantime, like-minded countries should decouple and reduce reliance on the US.

For me, the only real argument is national defense. Being cut off from something like semiconductors would be a disaster for the US so it would make sense in an industry like that. But blanket tariffs are just insane.

Another point, I heard Tim Cook explaining why Apple still produces in China, and it isn't because of cost but expertise and infrastructure. He claims the US has nowhere close to level of expertise than China has. This is something that takes years to cultivate. Idk, maybe you can make the argument it's better in 10 years but that's a big ""if""

Trump also tariffed Canadian heavy crude oil, which has no American replacement. The oil the US can produce is too light to be used in our refineries and has to be blended with heavy Canadian oil in order to be used. We physically cannot produce significant amounts of heavy crude oil since the oil deposits simply don't exist in the US anymore.

In this case the tariff is just a straight up tax, there's no possible way for domestic industry to replace the import.

Tariffs worked back in the 1800s, but supply chains are global right now. There are some things we simply cannot and never will be able to produce, mine, or grow at scale to satisfy even domestic demand (notably, much of our semiconductor business, which literally powers virtually every electronic product we own and use to live). I wouldn't be opposed to imposing tariffs on China - their state-sponsored companies can steal industry secrets, their goods are often priced to undercut competition, and they undermine US manufacturing as a result. However, there are certain things we simply cannot mine or produce at the scale of China, most importantly rare earth metals which are necessary for virtually every motorized or electric device we use. Even if we started a vast device recycling program, the price of actually extracting and refining those materials for reuse would likely be just as if not more expensive than just buying from china at higher prices.

I have some questions. Isn't the point of tariffs to encourage more companies to manufacture in the US, which would improve our industry, create jobs, and make us less dependent on foreign manufacturing? I'm not sure there's anyone arguing that tariffs are intended to drive consumer end prices down. Also, and we will have to wait and see what happens, but isnt the other intention of tariffs to replace our current federal funding mechanism? Like, reduce or eliminate income tax and revert back to pre 1913? I'm all for spending a little more on goods if i get to keep more of my income, assuming a net benefit. This would depend on your spending habits i assume but that comes down to personal choice. Im just not seeing the reason for debating a point no one disagrees with. Am i missing something?

""it would increase costs for the consumer with out bringing jobs back to America, which is the whole point"" no... the point is to justify income tax cuts which have a net negative for 90% of the population, pretty neutral effects for another 5-9% leaving the top 1% to maybe top 5% to save millions a year, each, while consumers pay a disproportionately high percentage of their income to the government, through tariffs.

I think 11:45 is a huge key here. Tariffs reduce international competition, so if there's enough competition in domestic industry then they can work. That requires restrictions on large corporations while allowing smaller ones to flourish.

The issue is trump is pro-corporation, and we have several domestic monopolies + tariffs. Plus trump has no idea what America's accessible natural resources are - those are the industries we should be targeting with tariffs. We're about to get much shittier, much more expensive products while the government and domestic CEOs get tons of money through ""indirect taxes"".

South American here - where inflation isn't just a concept, it's a way of life. Once prices go up, they never come back down, that's the new normal, even if inflation slows. Seems like a wake-up call for my American friends. Right now, the president here has a 49% disapproval rate despite record-high employment and inflation under 4%. Why? Because the cost of basic goods is still sky-high. Be careful what you wish for.

By what basis can you say that the necessary tax surplus would not be created?  This also isn't being done to lower income tax, it is being done to ELEMINATE federal income taxation and that is a very big distinction.  Getting a 25-30% pay increase will offset a 10-15% increase in the price of SPECIFIC goods.  If you are dramatically impacted economically by that increase in goods prices even with increased pay then you are already in a terminal financial situation no matter what happens.  This also ignores the insane bloat and corruption of the federal budget.  Once that is reigned in the overall cost required to keep the federal government functioning will be dramatically reduced.  China is also an adversarial nation in rapid decline, who has basically declared war so decoupling from them economically is also an important strategy.

Never underestimate your customer base and their ability to prioritize their needs.

Raising tariffs is obviously trumps way of weaking consumer purchasing powers and strengthening asset value; furthering the divide between rich and poor even more. This allows the rich to upcharge essentials like education, healthcare and public services untill the only way people can afford them is by selling their assets (materials, possessions, houses etc). Houses most critically, so the rich can purchase others land to again increase their asset value. Its a cycle that slowly takes more and more away from the consumer.

Key point (specifically with regards to businesses passing the rising costs due to tariffs onto consumers): the power ALWAYS lies with the customers.
Businesses are faced with two options; raise the prices to pay tariffs, or move to the US. 
WE WANT THEM TO MOVE PRODUCTION TO THE US. NOT RAISE PRICES.
so how do we do it? DON'T BUY EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS. 
If you pay the higher prices you have nobody to blame but yourself for the higher costs. 
Don't blame the government, because tarrifs have the potential of being a FANTASTIC solution to fixing all the inflation that the democrats create through creating a greater divide between the poor and the wealthy. But it will never work if we keep giving these companies our money rather than forcing them to be better. 
We have the opportunity to help pay off all the debts, fix the money printing problem that the last administration plagued us with, which will in turn lower inflation. 
But we have to be vigilant.
If you don't buy from foreign companies that raise their prices, they will be forced to comply and help the economy, if you DO buy from them, you are giving into these greedy companies and you are the sole reason for your own higher cost of living. NOT the tariffs.
Tarrifs are great, it is us, the people, that are contributing to rising costs.
You don't need to our financial education to see that, just think about it simply. If you were a business and were faced with tariffs to import to the US, would you raise the prices so you didn't have to lose profit, or would you move your factories to the US? The answer is simple. Unless you are forced to do so, you're going to keep manufacturing over seas and save your bottom line. So its up to us to force them to move to USA to continue making profits. DON'T BUY PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES (until they eventually give in and move to US to remain competitive).
It's not an anti-foreginers thing, it's a pro-economy thing. If you want to be able to afford food, then force the supply chain to drop prices by only buying American. They will set up shop in USA, and create job opportunities and it will be a much better thing for the world then them trying to be as cheap as possible and passing those costs down to you thus draining the economy.

Tariffs support inefficient domestic production, lead to higher costs for consumers and lead to poor product quality - despite paying full sticker price. As someone who's lived in India (which is a high tariff country) for most of my life, it's a little difficult for me to understand why the Trump administration wants to emulate the policies of a developing country.

Has it occurred to them that passing high tariff policies is what has made India poor long term?

Were you being serious when you said that the market for American pickup trucks is not as competitive or innovative as it should be?  I have to assume that this perspective is because you are on the outside looking in, with your own biases looking at it through a lens colored by your own domestic market.  

Our domestic pickup truck market is fiercely competitive and when left alone it innovates to give our consumers what they want.  It is usually government intervention that causes it to ""innovate"" in ways that the market does not want, such as the recent regulatory push for EV pickups.

In a bottle, yes tariffs are bad for consumers. But please don't forget the opposite of tariffs: subsidies. I think the idea of today's tariffs, is to counteract the subsidies policy of China. Remember, companies in China are partially owned by the state. This onto itself is unfair competition. If you include the fact that a lot of companies are also getting subsidies from the state(for example the car industry in China gets advantageous energy prices, in comparison with other industries in China), you can see why tariffs could be a good idea to level the play field, to be able to compete. So yeah, in a 100% fair economy, tariffs are a bad thing. But we are not living in a fair world economy, are we?

I don't think people realize that most working class people in the US live paycheck to paycheck. This is very bad and very unstable. 

Asking poor people to tighten their belts for the coming storm that wont bother you at all is absolutely insane. 

Whats even more insane is the number of poor people who have actually been gaslit into supporting this catastrophe. 

The next couple years will open some eyes once and for all. Silver lining.

The most important parts of the argument is missed:
1) Who does the ""counting""? We are also told that the US has the worst neonatal care in the western world. However, if one looks to see HOW baby deaths are counted, then you will see the US has the HIGHEST care. France. for instance, doesn't count any baby that is thought to have no chance of survival while the US counts EVERY baby regardless. The Friedman side is basically hoisted by their own petard. Tariffs and their effects are too complex to actually know exactly what the effects are. They are just estimations.
2) The poker problem. If you do not think tariffs have their place, then you must think you can play poker against a billionaire when you are just a normal person without betting limits. The US can't not compete against a world that has as much slavery as it does. And make no mistake about it. China uses slave labor.

I could go on, but why? If economic ideas would work, then this country wouldn't have been hollowed out by NAFTA.

The short-term issues with the tariffs are apparent; but the overarching problem here is that the US economy consistently operates at a massive deficit. Our prosperity is fake.

The only reason the us economy hasn't collapsed yet is because the USD is the world reserve currency (which is presently the case for a whole other list of reasons); effectively meaning the negative impacts of US economic policy are being distributed across most of the worlds population, rather than the US exclusively.

You might be able to argue that this status quo is preferable; but the reality is that the rest of the world will only tolerate so much more of this until they decide to leverage something else, like the Chinese Yuan, as the de facto reserve currency; at which point, it's game over.

The reality is that Americans are too comfortable and do not produce anywhere near enough value to afford their lifestyles; and Trump's tariffs appear to be the softest way to incentivize americans to take on risk and produce value; even if they do have a suite of temporal negative effects

I mean everything, including all the raw materials, the silicon, the iron, the plastics, mined, refined by US companies.   The bulldozer used to get the raw materials?  Only use 100% US machinery.  Only US mines and domestic sources.  If the materials, machinery, or skills don't exist?  Then screw it, we will do without.  The Amish live just fine and so will we.

The best way to bring more jobs to the USA is to bring more factories to US, and tariffs is no longer the right way for to do that. 

The best way is cut of the taxes to the companies, many companies will transfer their production to the USA, the right is it be zero taxes to the companies, it will force a good competition between countries to attract the companies, if cut the taxes to the companies it means the products will be cheaper, and the people will get a good benefit from that competition. 

This is basic, however, government just ignore that fact. 

Another thing is, cut of the federal income tax or it should be a little just to self defense only, as Israel does, the cost to be the cops on the world is to high for us US citizen, and today no-one wants to be those sponsors anymore.

That's just ridiculous.  Tariff laws must include a clause that loophole avoidance (such as the flat pack example in the video) should be penalized appropriately.

At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for Trump's insane ""strategy"" to even have a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products Americans buy today (or the components that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years; a lot of private and government investment; and lower cost labor (more legal immigration) to reverse the trend that drove the production of consumer products to China and Mexico in the late 90s and early 00s.

The US has been on a slow march towards deglobalization for a long time. Or perhaps more clearly stated, the US has been pushing towards self-sufficient production, and keeping as much as possible to be an exporter. Food, energy, military, and tech has been the focus since the 90s. And now the focus is moving towards manufacturing.
And this isn't something new. It started with the new nafta treaties in 2018, trying to move manufacturing ""close to home"" even if ""at home"" didn't seem practical... But manufacturing didn't move much, as it was still cheaper to manufacture in Asia, and import to the US directly. It wasn't until the first set of terrifs and the pandemic's interruption of supply chains that traction started happening. And then Biden doubled down on many of the same policies, and actually enforced the policies put forward by trump that ended up being easy to skirt around. And now trump seems to be tripping down on it all.

The things to watch that is taking people by surprise are
1) it is no longer just cheap Asian imports being targeted. The scope has broadened to practically all imported goods, even from allies and partner countries with long standing beneficial relationships. And nobody really saw that coming.
2) that the focus is no longer around bringing manufacturing purely to north America to keep prices low importing from Canada and Mexico which seemed to be the plan with Trump 1.0 and Biden. Now the rhetoric is that Canada and Mexico should seek statehood if they want nafta-like treatment... Which would make Republicans never re-electable ever again, which is why I think it is rhetorical and not an honest suggestion.

The thing is... This is already the direction things were moving. Just much more aggressively than anyone's wildest expectations. It takes time to build a manufacturing base, and it was actively being worked on, so the rush and change of the goal posts seem a little bit crazy.
I think the other effect is just how much this will cause disruptions to manufacturing and supply side inflation in the short run. As well as manufacturer side inflation building out the infrastructure and hiring needed to make this practical. Until the transition completes, we will likely see 5-10% inflation be normal before things settle down... And that could be a decade or two, which would be rough.
I suspect that the thinking is that we have the lead on AI and robotics, which will allow a sort of jobless manufacturing revolution. If that proves out, then inflation effects could be greatly minimized by the deflationary effects of automation... But as someone to follows those fields quite a bit, I don't think we are there yet at a practical level. Great strides have been made, and it is coming in the next decade... But pushing this hard this fast is taking too much AI PR hype at face value and not understanding how immature the tech is right now. It will get there... But still 3-5 years before any real reliable deployment is ready with expected costs and procedures that can last more than a couple years before being redone. And doing double-work at that scale is expensive and inflationary, not cost savings and deflationary like tech often is.

Next 4 years are going to be weird... I don't know. The world lost its mind, and we are all turning into Russia now. And I'm pretty sure that Russia is the first to say that they don't want to be Russia, so I'm not sure what the game plan and motive is.

The problem is there isn’t current movement back to the US besides the fear of the tariffs.
There is no reason to move to the US where the regulation on your business is so much higher.
China has us beat at grunt labor. I don’t think we can beat their sweatshop wages.
The idea was americans would get smarter and we would just do all the innovating and let the other countries do the work; however, a lot of dumb people here still need careers and so we need a certain amount of industry.
We only need a bit more and i believe our problems could be solved by by cutting regulations not by blanket tariffs.
I believe we actually don’t want to be the industrial powerhouse when we are and could remain the innovation powerhouse.
There are many other problems trump should focus on before this.

Written by someone who clearly only thinks short term and is unable to fully comprehend the entirety of the tarrif system.
I would like anyone who thinks a tarrif based system cannot work to do something.  Go look at your last pay stub.  Look at exactly how much you lose to taxes and figure out exactly how much you would gain in a year if you didn't have to pay it.  Then add on your fees, if any, to file those taxes.
Now, with this number in mind, would you have more or less money per year if the prices of every day goods rose by 10%, which would be more than expected?
For most Americans, that is going to be a massive increase in savings, if they manage it properly.  After a few years, the market will adjust, raising employment costs or lowering everything from employment costs and prices.  In the end, when you see a job advertising XX per year, that is actually what it pays instead of half that.  People will be more capable of living within their means instead of relying on credit.
Tarrifs simplify so much if it were to replace income tax.  The world is complicated enough and moving so fast that most cannot keep up, even if they won't admit it.  Tarrifs will help overall.  The only people it would actually hurt are the super wealthy, which doesn't actually hurt them, or those who are unwilling to manage money properly, which they do to themselves.

Just look at the last tariffs Trump started. Solar panel production has not returned. Metal tariffs did curtail chinese steel dumping that did drive china to more easily close some over production. However alu production did not return and did more plants get built in the US when china holds much of the raw material supply. Trump has tariffed  everything, low value stuff as well as high value items that just might have been brought back

I understand that this video is not entirely about this but is it at all possible that if trump were to put tarrifs on all imported goods and do away with income tax entirely that the two could cancel each other out? The individual products you purchase would cost more but you would be saving a lot of money by not having to pay income tax. As for a business owners perspective, I actually own a small construction company and pay around 30% on income tax, If I have to pay 25% more on materials but not pay income taxes I'm still up 5% on my net profit. I completely understand that a nations economy is a fickle thing and every change in policy can have unexpected results, but I believe that if it were done carefully, it could be done. I realize that there are and always will be companies that will use any chance they get to, lets be honest price gouge, but my customers can only afford to pay me so much for my services. So at least for myself in the above scenario I would lower my labor rate and pass the increased cost of goods onto the customer saving us both a little money and being able to outbid my more greedy compition on contracts. As for my now untaxed pay check, the amount would be a little higher, but all products would cost more, however I would essentially be ""paying taxes"" on only the products and services I actually use, making it easier to save money in the long run right?

Now with lower revenue for the Mexican Gov't, if it hits them hard enough, they'll end up coming to the negotiating table. Case in point, look at Canada's currency since Trump imposed tariffs.

Lets just say it.  Tariffs are a priori destructive.  No cases exist where they are economically beneficial because they eliminate competition and force consumers to buy goods they didnt want to voluntarily buy in the first place.  Tariffs raise prices and lower quality simultaneously while also picking individual winner and loser goods in the market.  Its honestly hard to think of a tax method that is more destructive and distorts the market forces more unfairly than tariffs.

Considering only national security and business, disregarding ethical concerns.

I looked at some goods we use where prices have doubled in the last 8 years...has our pay doubled?  no... this will make it even worse.  maybe save a few bucks from lower taxes but then prices you have to spend even more than you save...not going to work.  if Trump sees this as us forcing us to make more goods here etc. sure, but guess what.  the cost here is a lot more than 10% or 25% so these tariffs just increase prices and do little to increase production in the USA.

Think the point is that the American Economy is strong enough to handle price increases right now if it means that geo-political missions are accomplished. China, Mexico and Canada can only hold on for so long without American's buying their exports. At some point they'll have to cave and give in to what the Americans want. Which I believe is for those countries to do a better job of policing their borders and drug traffickers. In my opinion, it's worth it.

Key takeaways:
1. Tariffs are paid by the importer and passed on to the consumer, but Trump has convinced MAGA that Mexico and China will pay for the tariffs.
2. Even if inflation worsens, MAGA will blame Democrats instead of looking into the mirror.
3. Expect dramatic increases in export from countries like Vietnam due to Chinese exports flowing through there.
4. Tariffs won't create factories in America out of thin air, the most likely outcome is importing everything from the next cheapest country. 
5. Even with tariffs in place, most goods made in Mexico and China will still be way cheaper than those made in the U.S

Its just possible the blanket ban shoes trump which tariffs to drop later. What price increases vs domestic manufacting at home hits his voters the most. What gets reported on fox news and can producers and retailers just say its tariffs without tariffs ever having that impact on them like the dryers.
In an ideal plan, you'd tariff high value imports like cars in mexico and Canada or expensive electronics (robots, precision engineering, dumped goods looking for any market sales even at a loss). He'd tariff chips but he need Taiwan and the chip act needs time and the intel saga to work out. 
The good news is that all those markets taiffed will look to export away from the US

Trump needs to raise tax's on American workers to offset the renewing of the Corporate tax cut. So he cant raise income tax's so this is the 3 card trick. He is a con man always has been. This will cost American households about $2600 per year.

If you do the math, 1800 jobs at 815k per job, that's 1.467 billion. Pretty darn close to the 1.5 billion. Also you have to account for the dryers cost being raised as well as the taxed washing machine. Which is a relatively unique example of price increases, that inflates that 1.5 billion. Also in your example of steel, why didn't the domestic industries like auto, just buy domestic made steel? At 9:12  shouldn't that mean more domestic steel companies start popping up to meet the demand? I'm not quite convinced by this evidence you presented.

I'm in support of tariffs worldwide because we need to grow more localized industry (both for the purpose of wealth equality and climate reasons) but ironically they simply wont work in any positive manner unless you were to implement so called 'socialist' policies like taxing the 1% more (which solved the great depression) and dismantling the financial sector along with the myth of infinite growth. 

Otherwise countries like america are simply hastening their current path to mimic china more closely with a few ultra wealthy families paying slave wages to workers in unsafe conditions and hoarding the generated wealth to themselves (which is already their current situation, just not as extreme yet). Funnily enough Trump even wants to reintroduce children to factory work, just like china.

"6:40 this is the critical bit. The tariffs establish a new price baseline, even for domestic goods in that category. Even if the tariff goes away, the price has been permanently raised."
"Small business owner here: Tariffs on the things I buy (my cookbooks, and a few other things) are printed in China through a Chicago based company.

When I looked locally for printing services, the price was 3x. If the price had been 1.5x I would have considered it, but 3x is too much. Most people won't pay $50 for a cook book and I don't want to charge that.

I just got a notice from the company we work with that I'm being charged another 10% on my next shipment as a ""just in case"". I don't have a choice here, I just have to eat the cost.

I'm not raising my price on goods, just eating the cost. This hurts small businesses.

Don't get me started on groceries and cost of foods. Chef friends I know are incredibly worries."
"One point you forgot is that global markets don't like uncertainty (which includes the USA).
As the British Columbia premier said: no matter if these tariffs are lifted, they are doing everything possible so that B.C. is never finding itself again in the current situation. (meaning decoupling from the US economy)"
"If groceries keep going up, I will apply for Gov food assistance.  If I can't get it, I try the Food Banks.  If that fails, I guess I will be homeless just to buy food.  Many like me are already on the edge.  This is insanity."
"Targeted tariffs on things you manufacture domestically? Potentially Good.

Blanket tariffs, allies or supply chains be damned? Always Bad."
The last Circuit board I designed has 480 parts. This goes in a product with 300 parts. There is no way every single component is getting made in the US.
This channel is set for the next 4 years
"If Trump is advocating for economic chaos, it could be part of a strategy in which market crashes are perceived as chances for the ultra-rich to acquire assets at reduced prices. Annually, those with substantial capital tend to benefit disproportionately during periods of volatility"
"As an Argentinian, you are doing the same errors we did for a century. Bread for today, hunger for tomorrow"
"Go ahead and list all the ""Made in USA"" Alternatives.

Now, list all the ""Made in USA"" items that are only made from 100% American parts. 

Now you can see how expensive everything is about to get, and thought COVIDS inflation was bad."
"The biggest issue that wasn't addressed is that companies need to believe that the tariffs will be stable long term. 

No one is going to spend five years building a factory if they think the tariffs will go away in two to four years."
This was a level headed and nuanced analysis of what tariffs are and what their affects can be. KUDOS
"Yeah, it's not exactly helpful for consumers to force the price of foreign goods to rise if the domestic companies are just gonna jack up the domestic good prices too for more profit."
"As a Brazilian, I must say tarifs haven't worked here to develop our economy and they just made everything more expensive and our productivity worse. In other words, tarifs are one of the key factors that maintained us poor."
"Avocado trees grown from seed can take anywhere from 5 to 15 years—or even longer—to bear fruit, while grafted trees typically produce fruit within 2 to 3 years. However, some trees may never produce fruit at all. So, if you’re planning to grow your own, good luck with that.  

Now, let’s talk about something even more essential—coffee. The U.S. consumes a staggering 54 billion tons of coffee per year but produces only 11.2 billion tons, leaving a massive gap that must be filled through imports. The U.S. sources coffee from countries like Canada, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and Indonesia. I’m all for strengthening American industries, but we’re stepping into an economic battle without the necessary resources. In the short term, this is going to hurt—a lot. Hopefully, your job isn’t on the chopping block when the dust settles.  

Will this strategy pay off in the long run? That’s a tough call. Look at North Korea—we forced them into self-reliance, but at what cost? Russia tried to isolate itself from the global economy, yet after three years, they still haven’t managed to take over a much smaller neighboring country. And then there’s the UK—ask them how Brexit is going. The results of economic isolation aren’t exactly promising. Maybe this will work out, but we’re taking a huge gamble.  

Launching an economic war without the proper preparation—without the ""armor and weapons,"" so to speak—was reckless. There had to be a smarter way to approach this.  

The U.S. relies heavily on imports for essential goods, including fruits and vegetables. Mexico, for example, supplies a significant portion of our tomatoes, berries, and avocados. It’s easy to say, “We’ll just grow it ourselves,” but reality isn’t that simple. Growing food at scale requires the right climate, soil conditions, labor force, and infrastructure. Certain crops, like coffee and avocados, thrive in specific environments that the U.S. simply doesn’t have in abundance. Even if we could expand domestic production, the costs would be much higher, and the supply wouldn’t be able to meet demand overnight.  

It’s not just about whether we  grow it—it’s about whether we can do so efficiently, affordably, and at the scale needed to sustain the economy."
Short answer is ''No'' and the long answer is still ''No''.
"Tariffs only work when the domestic labor is cheap and there is a need to protect developing domestic manufacturer.  That is how South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan developed their industry.  But, the U.S. labor is expensive and there is no need to protect already competitive American manufacturers.  The tariff will worsen the inflation and hurt the American people."
Once prices go up manufacturers and corporations selling the goods rarely lower them.
"8:46 Plates, sheets, strips, beams, bars, rods, pipes, billets, blooms and slabs

WE NEED A REMIX OF THIS!"
They just did. Mexico just agreed to put 10000 soilders along the US border. The Tariff with Mexico is suspended.
it’s like watching a slow-motion car crash where half the passengers are cheering it on because they think the wreckage will somehow only hit other people
"Price increases, brought to you by the people who said prices were too high."
We get 1.8 million tons of tomatoes from Mexico. We don’t have the infrastructure or labor to fill that gap our selves. So it’s not driving production anywhere. Just prices up. Substitute tomatoes for coffee or any number of things.
"I am grateful for a dispassionate, empirical discussion of tariffs."
"I absolutely the shift in rhetoric from his voters. Going from ""everything's expensive, we want lower grocery bills"" to ""we'll happily pay way more for the stuff we buy for the off chance that our grandkids can work in a factory in the future where they'll still be unable to afford those now American-made goods.""

The Chinese are loving this."
There's also this naive belief that large scale manufacturing in the U.S will create a bunch of new jobs. The reality is when building new facilities in the U.S the cost of labor makes mass automation far more attractive and the desire to make energy prices cheaper only motivates this even more.
"let me introduce you to the iphone 18
cost:$5000
made in USA by a minimum wage worker who was forced to work in a sweat shop for 14hours a day"
"This depends what the goal is. Tariffs do not work if the goal is to grow the economy and to make people richer. If the goal is national security with local supply chains, then they can work for that purpose."
"The claim about the 1890s cuts against the grain of research on those tariffs.  They benefited a few industries that were already doing well, but were incredibly harmful to consumers."
He slapped blanket tariffs (excluding oil) of 25% on two countries we import a ton of basic necessities from. 2024 will be a terrible year for consumers.
The question to ask is: who are these tariffs intended to benefit? The answer is not the american public
Its not an economic tool when you put 25% on all import from one country.
Tariff is an economic tool that is used to protect a sector which is important to national security of the country. Trump is betting that Canada and Mexico will capitulate under pressure from American tariff. Problem is that tariff will impact American consumers and industry as well. If Canada and Mexico resolve is strong and want to stand against America then Trump will taste a bitter defeat as his campaign promise was reduction of inflation.
"Yeah man, who can forget that Trump's tariffs worked so well last time, he had to bail out farmers.
Edit: Seems like people don't know the difference between a subsidy and a bailout."
"10:54 ahh, the chicken tax - the reason why we're stuck with shitty trucks while the rest of the world can enjoy the immortal Hilux."
"Remember that the subsidies to 'farmers' that cost as much as the tariffs were bringing in went overwhelmingly to big agribusiness -- not to family farms.  It effectively taxed all Americans, resulting in higher consumer prices, while paying out billions to the richest Americans.  This was the plan all along -- tax all Americans and funnel that money to the richest Americans."
"One thing that never seems to be mentioned: soft power. All these tariffs, deportations, hissy fit withdrawal from international institutions and economic sabre rattling just introduces uncertainty, confusion and international enmity towards the U.S"
"As a South American. NOOOOO, THEY DONT WORK.
Every south american country followed the ""Industrialization by Substitution of Imports (ISI)"" system between the 50's and the 60's (basically puting tarifs on a lot of imported goods, with the objetive of growing our local industries)
To finish my story: Every country got poorer, THE END"
"The thing that conversations tend to miss is that we actually need significant inflation at the moment to keep the Federal debt from snowballing. No one likes that, but in light of the fact that inflation is necessary and inevitable and complex supply chains are already breaking under international tension, tariffs make a lot of sense. The pain is inevitable, the question is if your local industry will be anywhere close to a position to pick up the slack."
"There is a pattern to isolationist countries in contemporary times: they get poorer, sometimes much poorer.  The age of mercantilism is long gone: we don't have the stomach or means to  take and control enormous blocks of territory to make it work."
no. there are some cases where it can be good but like... a raw 25% increase across the board? that just incentivizes bad business
"Classical economists figured this out since Ricardo. Tariffs only hurt consumers. Ricardo, Keynes, Friedman, and basically all other economists agree. This isn't a debate among economists."
So far every tariff has lasted an average of 9 minutes before the imposed country caves so... I'm gonna go with yes.
"when a bunch of countries focus another and put tariff on it? yes, it works

when your country starts aiming at every other country and apply tariff to them... isn't then YOUR country the one being aimed by the others?"
Tariffs will make life more expensive for americans
"The problem is the economic effect is not the goal, the threats are geopolitical leverage meant to force concessions."
"Here is one thing nobody is ever talking about: price control comes down to the consumers in the end. Everyone is complaining that prices are going to go up because businesses have higher costs now, however the only reason why the prices go up due to this is because of corporate greed who would rather destroy a family and their livelihoods than to decrease their yearly salary. you know 1 billion sounds much better than 900 million. If the customer refuses to purchase what these companies are selling, then now they are forced to drop prices. If they fire people to do it, it will come to a limit since they all have a minimum of employees needed to ensure the production of their goods. aka you can make a product without people to make it. finally leading them to decrease their costs in the only place left, their own pockets. Boycotting works. people today are just weak and comfortable. fighting each other instead of fighting the big boys."
My company recently built a factory in Mexico. Consequently all US manufacturing was shut down. During a town hall meeting someone asked the CEO if Biden's chips acts will reindustrialize America and he said until the govt can bridge the labor gap it will never be economical to manufacture in the US when it costs 6x less in other countries.
"Being an American that actually understands tariffs and some impacts on prices we pay and back and forth cost with foreign tariffs, I still learned so much from your presentation. Especially why tariffs appeared to work more than a century ago and even in the 60's but possibly questionable now and the way in which they are being implemented. Unfortunately, we have elected a president with hammer. God bless all the screws that suffer!"
"I've seen what this type of blanket tariffs do to the market, consumers will be worse off. This protection causes the locals to be complacent and we ended with expensive quality import or marginally negligibly cheaper but worse local products."
"Looks like we got the answer to this one pretty quickly. Yes, tariffs apparently work as a political bargaining chip to bring a foreign country to the table. I would say they work effectively, given that it took all of one day for Canada and Mexico to come to the table and agree to Trump's initial terms in order to get a temporary stay on the tariffs."
"This went right over the most important thing. After WWI, in 1929, the Smoot-Hawley tariff act, preciptated the great depression, which lasted up to the rearmament for WWII."
"I could go back to expensive goods if they lasted. Unfortunately, goods such as furniture, and so many household appliances, don't hold up over time."
Also worth noting that the chips act and tariffs placed on China last time around meant that they had to be more innovative and resourceful which lead to Deepseek and $1 trillion getting ripped off the stock market.
"From the future here, they worked"
"Tariffs are an import tax paid by the importer when goods arrive at the port. Blanket tariffs do nothing but raise prices and, in turn, increase inflation. This will do the exact opposite of lowering prices for us as consumers."
"Imagine my shock over a complex subject with much nuance is boiled down to one-sentence insults on social media. 

I bet nobody saw that coming."
"Tariffs only make sense to protect strategic industries like food or defense production. For everything else, they're nonesense."
Definitely worked as a negotiation tool
The tariffs placed on Mexico and Canada are foolish at best.
"Here's a list of U.S. products that Canada has placed tariffs on, based on the information available:

Dairy Products:
Milk: 270%
Cheese: 245%
Butter: 298%
Yogurt: Included but percentage not specified
Sausages: 69.9%
Poultry:
Chicken: 238%"
"Well, first things first. Putting tariffs on your  political and economical allies is just dumb.

The tariffs on computer chips from Taiwan (TSMC) without having a comparable chip manufacturing here in the states is just suicide.

Intel sucks. They sucked so much in their own fabs, they started to outsource to TSMC. And TSMC has plants being built in AZ, but they won't even be staffed until mid 2025 and won't start to produce until 2026. And even then, the fab is a fraction of what exists in Taiwan.

It's like quitting a job with no unemployment and no job lined up. It's just stupid. These tariffs are dumb but man, if you're gonna do it, you could at least wait to do it until we have it stateside."
"So far every country caved in days at most. Works great, used for negotiations."
Kudos on navigating a neutral tone for this topic by optimistically framing the fact that tariffs might benefit decades down the road if done strategically and effectively.  That being said...the pros/cons side of things for this move is heavy on the cons side.
"if someone in the admin would have a little education on the past history of such things, as the hawley-smoot act, they wouldn't have to  be going thru this..."
"I cannot tell you how much i despise economic thinking in this day and age. We act like we know everything and then immediately forget about it. This is simple. Tariffs do things, they have pressures, you have to account for those pressures for a tariff or literally any other thing to be accomplished adequately. There. Inflation is an upward pressure. Deflation is a downward pressure. There are steps to achieve either, but we act like we don't know how to do that. The truth is, everyone is a coward. Too scared to say sometimes growth isn't good if it doesn't map to two things. One, real growth, two, human well being."
"O thank you, ive been waiting for this one, was searching your channel for it yesterday actually. Youre on of the only economists I trust. None of these politisized, big media companies."
"There’s no need to overcomplicate things. The simplest explanation is that the cost of maintaining a global empire has begun to outweigh its benefits for the U.S., prompting it to retract its sphere of influence. To preserve as much of its original interests as possible during this retraction, it has resorted to imposing tariffs and maintaining the dollar’s dominance. In the foreseeable future, however, the era of dollar hegemony will inevitably end, and the U.S. will transition into a continental empire in the Americas."
Another thing to consider is that now manufacturing in first world economies is much more automated than it was when manufacturing left the US so even if tariffs brought back all of the production that has been sent offshore it will only benefit a relatively small portion of the population.
I got an ad for your documentary on this video haha
No politics. Just economics. All it takes is an Aussie to give you real unbiased solid information. I loved my semester abroad studying business there!
"This is exactly what I have been saying, and I've never taken an Econ class in my life. How a government could get it so wrong is just astounding. 

This leads me to the conclusion of an ulterior motive. What exactly that is though is speculation. However some options are politics/controlling culture, generating wealth for certain people, greater control of the masses through buying power,  militaristic expansion."
"If tariffs cause potential rivals to create their own versions of industries they relied on you for that removes another barrier to conflict, increasing risks of conflict."
"If there's the commensurate incentive to redevelop local industry to replace prohibitively expensive imports? Yes.

If it's still too hard to build local sourcing, no."
All good points. Tax the rich. Tax companies. Regulate prices. Regulate profit growth. Enable ownership by the worker. Stop the growing inequality.
I love the sheer amount of fancy terms we’ve developed for “hidden tax on poorer people”
"And just like that, the tariffs are gone, with guarantees from both Canada and Mexico to help guard the border. Can tariffs work? They did."
"Write your congressman to rescind the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The founding fathers kept the power to tax with congress for a good reason, they shouldn't have given it away."
"That point about income tax not existing until 1910 has A LOT MORE to do with the fact that US gov did not provide most services we associate it with today, they did a lot less so they needed a lot less hence no need for income tax. Nowadays tariffs could never be enough to provide everything you are used to, from public weather forecast, skilled firefighting and police forces, and the large subsidies on everything from corn, beef, apples to automotive industry. They sure did not have public airports and metro (first NYC metro actually opened in 1904 but it was private at the time) and they sure did not bail out their banks and carmakers time and time again. THAT is the real reson."
"This is a much simpler way of looking at it:
Tariff → Higher Costs for Importers (Local companies buying international goods)
Enough Tariffs → Domestic Manufacturing Becomes More Competitive (Reduces imported goods)
Local Manufacturing Expansion → More Jobs & Higher Wages (Potentially)
Higher Wages → More Spending Power
More Money in the Economy → Higher Prices Become Manageable

Additionally, Tariffs hurt importing companies that are taking advantage of a much richer country and essentially draining their wealth.
As long as you are invested in the American economy or working in it, tariffs will not hurt you in the slightest."
Many people here have a lot of complaints about Tariffs before we even see what effects they have. Since many other countries use Tariffs we cannot complain that they extreme or somehow unfair. It is also glaringly clear that no one else has any plan of a better way to either repatriate industry or to ensure that companies that sell products in the US to follow US labor and environmental laws. I don't know if Tariffs will work but I see nothing from anyone else here. Saying it can't be done is defeatist and unhelpful. Come up with an alternative plan.
"The rising rates can be attributed to increasing imports and decreasing exports, largely due to the Trump-era tariffs, which triggered retaliatory measures. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in the banking crisis, given its policies of quantitative tightening and higher interest rates. If these conditions persist, something will eventually give. With this in mind, is it really a good time to have savings invested in stocks?"
This was an informative and fair video! I live in Canada so it will be interesting to see how things go. I'm predicting poorly for all involved.
"Some half truths were told in this video.
Steel temporarily went up in price. After a few months, the price of steel went down. This made products more affordable than before the tariffs."
Short answer: Yes
"Panama folded.
Venezuela folded.
Columbia folded. 
Mexico folded. 
Canada folded. 

...yeah it works."
What was the root cause of all the tarrifs you mentioned?  Looks like lobbyists were holding down industry in areas we see for profits in areas we don't see.
"Considering Mexico has sent 10,000 troops to the U.S./Mexico border to help prevent flow of drugs (fentanyl) from crossing the border, I’d say we cannot simply rule tariffs out as a negotiating mechanism."
what happened to being tough on China? You taxing China only 10% and our Mexican/Canadian friends 25%? How this make any sense
"I don't know about you, but I would much rather have the federal government funded by tariffs than income taxes. If you can buy American, you pay no federal taxes."
Moral of the story: have no tariffs and promote a free world when you have no competitor of factories production like post-WWII
As it turns out the primary effect of a tariff is leverage.
From what I've heard the US tarriffs were in direct response to drug trafficking and Illegal migration from Canada and Mexico. It doesn't make sense to me that a sudden blanket tarriff on these countries would solve these seemingly unrelated issues...
"For a long time, the U.S. got most of its money from tariffs, but as the country grew and needed more cash for things like infrastructure and social programs, tariffs weren’t cutting it anymore. By 1913, with the 16th Amendment, they introduced income tax, which made raising money way simpler and fairer—especially since it could target higher earners more. This move basically ended America’s heavy reliance on tariffs and opened up the door to a bigger government role in the economy. Going back to tariffs ONLY suits the richer people and would require a massive cut in government spending. Tariffs swapped in against lower progressive income tax are a flat tax rate which is particularly rough on the lower 80% of earners suiting only at best the top 20% and more likely the top 5% of earners."
Thanks for the ad in the middle.
"You miss one important thing, which the main purpose of tariffs... its political.

Whether to just gain nationalist popularity like trump is doing.

Or on the other hand punish other states, just like trump is doing also ..

US may have lost money from tarrifing steel .. but the main purpose was getting leverage over others and delaying certains states development .. which is priceless, and the us is willing to pay the price for."
"Mexico and Canada already caved to Trump's tariffs. They work. Of course, the caveat is that not every country has the same leverage as a production superpower like the US or China."
Why is everyone acting surprised that the guy they voted for is doing exactly what he said he would do 
"I think you've missed a major economic factor of unemployment rate. With the current US very low unemployment rate of 4.1% tariffs are more likely to backfire since there is very few people available to increase production, thus already high labor costs are likely to only increase. Tariffs make much more sense in an economy where there is lots of people looking for work."
"The quick answer is yes. Mexico this morning said they’re temporarily suspending tariffs to negotiate a deal that puts 10,000 Mexican troops on the southern border to help with the border crisis."
"It's just increased taxes ""Trump sales Tax"" was a good slogan"
What about imposing tariffs that don't start for years to come in order to encourage long term divestment?
"Honestly, where tariffs become most enticing is the idea that the income tax could be significantly reduced or eliminated at the federal level. 
Tariffs are by their nature for the average citizen a tax on how they want to live, you can avoid a tariff by not buying the product. Or (In some cases) buying domestic. A tax on income is a tax on producing something in the economy and is unavoidable, what's more, funding the government on tariffs would eliminates the need for income tax returns."
"A topic not covered, but extremely important is that the impact (the pain) on consumers is inversely proportional to their wealth. Meaning, the poorer will become poorer, and the increased price on the usual goods won't impact that much the rich => more inequality, more civil unrest, and just more overall unhappiness. It's yet another ""tax on the poor"" ..."
"very timely video, but it's gonna be hard to follow stories with the frequency they are currently happening"
Tariffs would only work if we are putting them on goods/services where we have a comparetive advantage in making
thanks for the economics and history conversation on tariffs
"You can't ""encourage entrepreneurs"" to grow certain food products in a part of the world where the plants are unable to grow. Unless we are going to turn Hawaii back into a series of plantations -- which was horribly unjust to the indigenous people already there -- or do the same to island territories that are part of the USA, we cannot grow coffee beans, cocoa beans, pineapple, etc. domestically . Yes, there are some areas in California and the south where we can grow avocados and citrus fruits, and what not -- but they are already pretty much spoken for. 

And until American companies are willing to pay American wages for manufacturing again, those jobs aren't coming back either, tariffs or not"
Canada and Mexico folded..
"Let me get this straight; China, India and Brazil can and should use tariffs to protect their economy and industries, but the US can't? 
LOL! Ok..."
People need to understand the difference between short term impact and long term benefit.
Mercedes doesn't have a plant in South Carolina. BMW has one there. The Mercedes plant is in Alabama.
"In short as far as Mexico and Canada, so far. Yes."
Ask Hoover. His similar tarif war lead to the great depression….but on the other hand great fortunes are built during economic turmoil…so it did work for the super rich.
"yes, indeed, and we have seen them work within the last day. Both Mexico and Canada have acquiesced to Trump‘s recommendations and has lift for 30 days in order to see if these two countries were making progress with their agreements. One interesting point is with the agreement concerning Mexico, Trump needs to stop or significantly reducethe flow of high-powered weapons from the USA to the Mexican cartels. It will be interesting to see if he can get this done. Either way, this is all working out for the benefit of the American people."
It’s going to look expensive for everything…
No. The baboon bancrupted a casino. Saved you 16 minutes.
"Here I saved you watching the entire stupid video, we the people pay them."
"Great video! As an economics professor here in Brazil, I'm very familiarized with those consequences of tariffs. It's hard to impose a developmental program on tariffs these days, Brazil has many examples where it didn't work AND nowadays, we are suffering from one of those old days protections: coffee inflation, we are used to coffee surplus but last year we have a dramatic reduction in coffee production to internal market and import it is expensive because tariffs. Brazilians can't dispense coffee from our routine consumption (it is very inelastic), even breakfast here is called: ""café da manhã"" (""coffee of the morning"" in a literal translation)."
The tariffs for Canada and Mexico worked!
Grabs popcorn and heads to the comments section
God we live in the dumbest timeline
"I understand it is difficult to grasp, but tariffs are not there for their short-term effect. They are there to push change to the local industry and that can take decades to happen. Especially in western countries who have grown complacent and have forgotten how to manufacture basic products."
Looks like they worked
It would be interesting to hear your views on how tariffs could be used to address the cost of environmental damage from shipping goods. I.e. impose a tariffs to internalise that externality
Considering the Mexico tariffs have been suspended now that Mexico is deploying 10k soldiers to provide assistance with border security I would say they are definitely working
"If most Americans recognized that a tariff is a tax, I wonder if they would still be on board for it. ""My taxes are too high, they should be lower! Except when I buy groceries, appliances, gas and cars, then they should be higher!!!"""
Can we get the Economics of Economic Explained explained!?
"You're looking at it from a technical perspective. Trump is looking at tariffs as a bargaining tool to get what we wants from the country. For example, Mexico President just folded like a napkin and gave concessions to Trump for a 1 month delay in tariffs on Mexico."
And those American auto manufacturers are made in both Canada and America. And require back and forth between the countries multiple times. So the upcoming 25% Tarriffs are going to be charged multiple times. So the auto industry is going to die in both countries.
Nice work. Should be mandated viewing everyone. Especially the US.
"i remember a time when conservatives used to say ""you can't tax a country into prosperity""."
Unfortunately the expensive domestic labor isn’t expensive enough for many people to live comfortably without a large number of roommates.
Just a reminder trump is getting his way with the threat of Tariffs.
The only thing that I like about the tariffs is that it pushes the US away from the child labor and poor wages that China emposes.
It's simple. Move your company to the US to avoid the tariffs or stop complaining.
"lol, looks like they worked, less than 24 hours since your video was posted..."
Yep just worked this day. Mexico capitulated and agreed with americas terms.
"The main issue imo is that pay has not increased with the value of the dollar. The more people are able to spend, the better the economy does"
You forgot to mention they can be used as leverage to negotiate. They worked.
It is ironic that the ad read for Grammarly incorrectly used the word “less” when “fewer” should have been used.
"They do, Columbia et Mexico caved in in a matter of hours."
"America is one of the most prosperous nations in the history of the world. Why people are so doubtful is astonishing to me, look at the tariffs we put on Mexico and Canada, they immediately slapped us with there own and what happened to there currency…tanked. We have some of the best products in the world and comment thread economists know best"
"I know in the short term this will hurt low-income Americans, but in the long term I really do think this will help the lower and middle class of the US regain more control of our nations wealth. We've become addicted to having cheap labor and goods manufactured abroad at the expense of the average American worker. The only thing I'm somewhat hesitant about is tariffs on rare earth elements that we can't exactly mine within our own territory like Lithium or cobalt

Edited for spelling and clarity"
Tariffs should not be imposed on countries but on certain industries like semiconductors and automobiles.
One thing these comments are missing is if by passing tariffs the government can lower taxes by 25% it might just work. I am a farmer. I pay my taxes for the entire year on march 1. If the rest of the country had pay taxes the way I do there would be a revolution. There is taxes on everything. Everywhere. I am not excited about the uncertainty but the status quo isn’t working either. If we keep doing same thing things will continue to get worse. This is worth a shot in my opinion
"Tariffs are good for the people collecting the additional costs.
And bad for the consumer who is paying for the tariffs."
Nice to watch something that’s not full of partisan bias
"Seems to me the tariffs are already working.  Ask Columbia, Mexico and Canada how it went for them."
Excellent video! Very balanced and level headed approach to the subject.  I'm an immediate fan of this channel.
"So Canada and Mexico bent the knee within 24 hours and did exactly what Trump wanted. This proves my point, that Trump used tariffs (or the threat thereof) as a diplomatic tool, and your economic analysis was interesting but ... irrelevant."
“Income tax will get whacked” *me who lives in nh where their already is no income tax  
Yet no country wants to be hit by them from The President. The negotiating tactic is working 
I just don’t want any taxes taken out of my check 
This is just another example of why the economy is too complicated and fragile to entrust to politicians to play with.
It’s fun reading all the comments after Trump made Canada & Mexico bend the knee.
Working so far
"What struck me about this is that timing and context means everything, tariffs worked when there was little industry in the country and it worked again when we had few competitors after WW2. So how do we get better higher paying jobs back in the country, when cheap manufacturing has become so dominant in other parts of the world? In this current context?"
"Dude, were you born yesterday? Were you around Trump's 1st term?? Tariffs was one of the big factors as to why our economy skyrocketed and why we had more money in our pockets in between 2018 and 2020."
This aged HORRIBLY . Within 24 hours counties are folding to Trumps tariffs.
"Mexico already agreed to Trump's demand on border protection and security. So yes, they worked."
What a fantastic video. Excellent points using historical examples of how tariffs worked for and against. All in an easily digestible format. Thank you for making this!
"Can tariffs work? Ask mexicos 10000 troops, making thier way to the Mexico border"
Y’all real quiet since his tariffs worked 
"If you just waited a day, you would have the answer you need shortbus. yep they worked and you wasted a lot of time putting this video together. So close your mouth, open your ears, watch and learn."
"TLDR 
Tariffs great for the wealthy, and not for mid and lower income households. Businesses have never pass the savings on to their customers. It just means they get to keep more money if capital income taxes are removed."
🇨🇦🇨🇦 BUY CANADIAN 🇨🇦🇨🇦
I know tariffs are mostly bad for economies unless used in a very specific and prudent ways. But I'm sure a man that bankrupted himself twice has it all figured out 
Thanks Trump
"Seems like the best idea would be to have tariffs on luxury items. I'd like to see lower cost of goods needed for daily life, energy, food and housing. Let those that have more money choose to spend it or not on things that are luxuries."
"Bueller, Bueller! 

Ben explained it and MAGA looks just like his class."
It worked lol
They just did
"This channel is one of the few that I can only watch on 1x speed. Most of the others I can easily speed up to 1.25x - 1.5x, but not this one. It's not a bad thing though, it's just the information density is very high in here."
Short answer: No.
oops they worked 
"Without watching the video, yes, tariffs work. They’ve worked throughout American history, especially in our early years. Next question."
They did.
"12:33 Gotta give Mercedes Benz Vans credit. I worked there for 3 years, and during the pandemic. I can say with full confidence we didn't have shut down like the other automotive companies, We WORKED. They moved mountains so we can keep working. 
2018 MBV became a full production plant, still having to rely on VS20 vans to get to full capacity. When I left MBV in 2023 they were finishing their contract with USPS.
This was before Trump was elected, but because how successful MBV is doing in the US; Mercedes is investing to make their North Charleston plant their 2nd biggest van plant in the world!! 
It's cool to get a shout out, most people don't mention MBV."
Hello my favorite Aussie channel
Your facts and science make my orange god king look dumb so I'm angry and hate this video and all of the factual information espoused in it. Grr rawr angry maga
Trump is already mentioning XAI308K in his latest interviews. This coin is going to be BITCOIN 2.0
"Tariffs also play well to a domestic audience. Threaten a tariff, exact a minor concession, and then exalt the purported political gains at home. It’s naive to think that Trump doesn’t understand the inflationary impacts and, frankly, stupid to think that he would risk a politically disastrous inflationary outbreak. 

Take Mexico. He threatened tariffs, negotiated a “last minute” political accommodation from Mexico on border control, and will now claim that he achieved more in four days than Biden achieved in four years. This will play well politically."
"Customs professional here - regarding the 25% steel imports. Whilst its true  a company simply importing steel (to for example sell) would be subject to 25% duty, most large corporations would take advantage of inward processing procedures, which would drastically reduce the tax burden of the finished product"
"Better update the video after Trudeau's recent announcement.  Which begs the question, isn't it a leverage playing card to get what you want? Tarrifs is a negotiation process."
"I love the way he uses Google Docs as his default word processing tool, same as me."
"I work in a medical manufacturing and we import most of our things, recently we have started processes that would cause us to produce more of our imported parts in-house. We are prepping to manufacture our own PCBA boards. Thus creating new jobs. The downside I can see from this is that since it will cost us more to build these parts it will absolutely raise the prices of the finished goods."
"That US tuck market is awesome! As soon as I find an extra 80k laying around, I'm gonna get one!"
"There are plenty of economists (probably a majority) who would confidently make the blanket statement that all tariffs are bad.  Some might walk that back a bit and say there are sometimes exceptional circumstances in which they don't do more harm than good.

Dunno if this says more about tariffs or economists, though."
"Before watching the video, I'm going to say no they don't work.
30 seconds in ""if it worked for the USA once"" ... It didn't. That's a big reason we had the great depression."
The argument is that Tariffs will create more jobs in the USA for working class people. That is the point of Tarrifs. It isn't to make goods cheaper. Its to give people more opportunities in down run areas. As long as Economists keep ignoring the point they will continue to look like fools.
"If tariffs don’t work across the board, then why is Mexico and Canada threatening retaliatory tariffs? If it merely becomes a de facto tax passed onto its own citizens and has no effect on the target country, why respond at all?"
"When I moved to South Korea in 2010, I was surprised that a Samsung TV was MUCH more expensive than it was in the USA, that's because the major companies here convinced the government to put tariffs on foreign products to ""protect"" them.  However, instead, Samsung just raised the prices for domestic products.  Now with the world based on global and online shipping, it seems their was enough outrage, that these policies were reversed."
"Tariffs primarily impact consumers by leading to higher prices on imported goods, as companies often pass increased costs down the supply chain. While this can create financial strain for consumers in the short term, it may also encourage more mindful spending habits. The high rate of consumerism in the U.S., characterized by frequent purchases of items like new cars and smartphones, contributes to resource overuse and economic dependence on foreign manufacturing. Tariffs could potentially reduce this overconsumption by making imported goods more expensive, thereby promoting longer product lifecycles and supporting domestic industries."
The thing is. Tarifs only agect you if you buy the imported products... if you want to buy a Mercedes then you will be hit with the tarif but if you are happy with your Ford then not...
"Missed the part where Dryer prices rose ~12 percent, and they weren't included in any tariffs."
"Around the 11-minute mark, EE starts to briefly go off the rails, saying 'well, we know that tariffs were horrible for the US the last time, but you never know....maybe there's some secret benefits we'll only see years later, based on zero evidence.' Him also talking about Stellantis as a positive automotive conglomerate is hilarious for multiple reasons: 1. It is not a domestic U.S. conglomerate, it was a merger w/ Dodge, Jeep, Chrystler, and several European automakers including Pugeaut. 2. Demand for their vehicles, especially Jeeps, has plummeted, as you can see from Dodges and Jeeps both being THE BOTTOM TWO slowest-selling cars off the lot, as a verifiable fact. 3. The first thing the Stellantis CEO did was announce sweeping pay cuts and layoffs to U.S. workers; More Perfect Union has a great video documenting this, and 4. The quality for Jeeps has cratered, but their MSRPs went up 15+%. He recovers soon after this, but I think he needs to do his due diligence and not make up a steel-man w/ no evidence to attempt to ""both-sides"" this. As an American, I can confirm we're pissed about these tariffs."
The irony of doing an ad read for Grammarly and using less emails instead of fewer emails.
What a well thoughtout and well wxplained video. Thank you so much for your work. You won yourself a subscriber!
"Economists don’t differentiate between the economy and its workers. If stocks go up because jobs get exported, economists say that’s good. Tariffs are meant to protect domestic industry from external cheap labor and prevent jobs being exported."
They already have by the day after this video released. They were a negotiation piece.
"I don't know. People have been complaining about wage stagnation for a long time now. Tariffs should theoretically work in bringing jobs back domestically increasing the demand of domestic labor, theoretically increasing the cost of labor meaning wages should go up. Frankly even with all the issues outlined in the video this seems like a better angle than artificially increasing minimum wage which compresses the wages of jobs but doesn't necessarily raise them all. Min wage also reduces manufacturing in the US as well as almost all of economic history suggesting price floors are bad."
"Running an appliance repair business. Those 2018 tariffs hurt our industry pretty bad. 
It wasn’t just China. South Korea as well. I’ve makers for LG frenchdoor fridges went from $60 to $240 in like one day. If those tariffs worked then lg would have seen a smaller market share in appliances, but their market share grew in the period following those tariffs. It did nothing, because we produce nothing to little to satisfy demand."
You may want to update your video. The tariffs worked as expected. It has always been about reducing the number of drug (including fentanyl) and other trafficking.
"Thanks for the video, very thorough explanation."
Perfect non-biased perspective on terrifs
I got an ad about Economics Explained guy right when i clicked on the video. Wow.
"It’s a common misunderstanding that Lincoln intended to end slavery before the civil war, but it was during the civil war that he decided to do so. He was mainly concerned with preserving the union and it didn’t matter whether or not that included slavery"
Great video. One thing kinda glossed over was it matters what country is being impacted and what we import from them. In this case we are using tariffs as a strong arm move to give us negotiating power. Because the US can withstand the import losses where as Canada and Mexico will struggle. This is meant to push china out while putting pressure on mexico and canda for future relations and negotiations.
Great video! Very educative and full of nuances
"they say that theyre going to tax corporations less which will reduce prices of the items they sell because they’ll be able to sell stuff for less with the same profit margins, but they’re doing the exact opposite with tariffs by increasing the companies costs pushing the prices up, and at the end of it all, corporations dont lose any money, and we have to pay more because of the tariffs"
The problem that isn’t being talked about is the fact that tariffs on other countries = import prices go through the roof. The consumer is going to pay the price.
"I was once in the OEM sales department of one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers, handling the sale of parts to some of the world's largest car makers' manufacturing operations in the EU. Although I only had very small pieces of some very big pies, I was dealing with tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers from about 15 different countries... Many of those parts had commonality with those OEM's models in the US. Also dealing with the logistics side of things, it was crazy to see, first hand, just how many different pieces from every corner of the world have to fall in place before a car even starts its journey on the assembly line. I saw Brexit kill some of my customers' operations, so I'm fearful about what happens in the US if these tariffs stay in long term (especially as I now work for a US-bases manufacturing concern)."
One thing that you didn't address here: Tariffs used as a political tool.
"many people don't like going through the hard times but they enjoy the good times. problem is, i don't know if this is one of those situations that we have to pull through for a better outcome."
"Something that is often overlooked is the impact on currency. If the us dollar increases as a result of tarrifs and others decrease (as mexico and Canadas has  already) this helps US purchasing power of OS goods.

Companies in targetted country always eats some of the tarrif as well, particullarly when the market in the US is so lucrative."
"Another issue with regard to tariffs is the impact on labor alternatives.   The US economy is a highly diverse economy, with world leading service, information and finance sectors.  Unemployment in manufacturing intensive regions is low, particularly in newly industrialized areas with modernized facilities like the US Carolinas and in Texas.  In these areas, the biggest concern for manufacturers is the availability of workers, when a production worker can receive equivalent compensation in the service sector.   The fed has shown that the wage premium for production workers no longer exists.   So a raise in tariffs would raise the competition for production workers to meet increased demand.   This would drive up the price of workers in all sectors.   As Friedman noted: a tariff is a tax on the many for the benefit of the few."
"In short: Maybe on the long road, however, in the short term? We'll have to face the economic recoil this will cost and maybe cost us."
It takes some time to change over. I don't think even 7 years is a long enough term to really bring domestic competition up.
So how's it going?
"Mexico already came to an agreement that puts 10,000 Mexican troops on the border. Columbia came to the table real quick too. Id say yes they work."
Good and mostly objective analysis. Thanks
"Short answer: Tariffs work on specific litigation like steel, oil, certain goods, etc. Tariffs wars have never worked since over 100 years because most economies are now integrated. Its always a lose lose process. Always.
Its in every economic literature you can consult."
"This video gets all the right points. For the tariffs to work, local production must also be there are is competitive with imports after pricing adjustments.

The US currently lacks this, and any local manufacturing most likely still won't be competitive with imports after tariffs.

In short, this is just a tax on the public and little else."
"I could be wrong, but I feel like this video equates our early economic growth with tariffs without any real basis. Yes, we developed well in the 19th century, and we had tariffs, but that doesn't mean the tariffs made us better off than we would be without them."
"We can debate how the overall economy will be affected, there is no reality in which prices don't increase for consumers. It is essentially just a regressive sales tax on consumers."
"Que raro es ver que USA se Peronice considerando que tiene la posibilidad de ver sus resultados. Igualmente, si esta dispuesto a bajar impuestos locales al mismo tiempo de aplica tarifas quizas funcione a medias su plan. Pero considerando que su primer idea para obtener competitividad fue aplicar tarifas en vez de reducir impuestos lo veo complicado. Al final el resultado sera que empeore su productividad. Para mi esto puede terminar como predijo Parravicini (ojala me equivoque)."
Excellent work cheers from London
i hear audi and bmw are talking about building cars in usa to avoid tarriffs
Going the entire video without calling this a regressive tax is a crime
"Great video! I know you are trying to just cover tariffs, but if you wanted to make an ACTUAL part 2 without the geo-politics, you could get into subsidies (the anti-tariff). This would be great to cover to highlight that another use of tariffs is to combat subsidies, and this is another thing the WTO has been working towards along side the reduction is tariffs and that's a reduction in subsidies."
Guess we're just going to have to learn to fix our broken washing machines... Luckily we have plenty of YouTube creators that can help with that!
"The problem with these calculations is that almost everything ""made in the USA"" uses imported raw materials, components, or sub-assemblies. That means that tariffs make domestic goods less competitive and more expensive as well as imported goods. Global supply chains have become so interdependent that almost nothing is ""made in"" a single country."
"In the past, price fixing and monopolies were illegal.  Now, in many industries, like major appliances, it's a common practice.  If I look back over the last 50 years, there's one industry that has continuously produced better products year over year:  the auto industry.  Cars are cheaper, more efficient, and more reliable now than they were and they continue to improve.  If you ask me, the reason is competition, and the only reason we have it is protectionism.  (That is to say, I agree with the idea put forth in the video, that tariffs can be a tool that benefits consumers, if applied carefully.)"
"I can't help but notice this is literally just a re-write of the Wall Street Journal's video? Like, exactly the same? 
You have just copied and posted it now because it is relevant again."
Watching American politics as a foreigner has turned from light comedy to slow burn horror.
Please do a video on the costs of tariffs vs increasing corporate taxes
Thanks for an even handed explination.
"Whoa I just passed that Mercedes factory in South Carolina today, they have a massive emblem spinning on the roof and the building is freaking huge"
"Shipping products to a middleman country is actually illegal. The country of origin is where it's made, not where it ships from. Some do take the risk of interloading to avoid tariffs but if caught, there's some serious penalties and potentially jail time."
"When a tariff is imposed, jobs are NOT magically created. In fact, according to Henry Hazzlitt and other economists, the jobs are simply redirected to the industries where the tariff is being imposed. Consumers must spend more money on the increased prices for that specific industry, thus decreasing the amount of money they can spend on other products. This means that businesses in other American industries suffer, decreasing the number of jobs there. In conclusion, tariffs don't create jobs, they simply move jobs from a more efficient domestic industry to a less efficient one."
"Imagine imposing possible recession causing tariffs on your allies and then deporting all the ""cheap labor"" that may have helped curb the increased domestic costs...oh wait."
"I'd pay a significant tax if it meant that no more fentanyl got into the US. I'm not sure if this will actually be the result, but it's a major reason behind these tariffs that is getting lost in all of this."
"Imagine people finding out who actually pays these tariffs. It's not an ""Economic Tool"", It's an additional tax."
"Tariffs work better for developing nations that are heavily dependent on a small number of industries, especially when those industries are primary extraction or require minimal processing. But in a developed service economy, you want your raw input materials to be cheap to improve quality of life and make it easier for people to have extra income to spend on services."
"So I feel that tariffs are going to be devastating. 1. What is to say Trump stops at China, Canada, and Mexico and not hit other important countries. 2. China pulling out and we lose a ton of objects that we depend on.
3. Other countries see this and start boycotting objects that they can make or get somewhere else cheaper (like the boycott of US liquor in some Canadian provinces).
I hope I am wrong...."
"If the tariffs apply for crude oil, it will show at the gas station, in 2022 the US did import nearly half of its oil from Canada."
Domestic producers: yay perfect timing! we have an excuse to increase price to match the tariffs and get better revenue this year
We need to focus on driving the cost of living as low as possible. Which would drive labor cost down and bring in more jobs
"Completely unrelated but I had mid roll ads, I’m paying YouTube for a ad free experience yet 80% of the content I consume run some time of mid roll ad."
Can we just acknowledge how weird it is that the lower taxes party is supporting tariffs now while the higher taxes party is supporting taxes on everything except imports now?
"with the whole thing about annexing canada, mexico and greenland, the tariffs are meant to be as disruptive and hurtful as possible. and this won't be the end of it"
Not a single Trump voter will watch this and they wouldn't even understand it. They're too busy losing money on the Trump meme coin.
Billionaires should be the ones to absorb the cost to protect us all from this. Wishful thinking imagining billionaires have souls
"Instead of just asking and theorising he's doing it to see if it can or not, so the best awnser is to just wait and see what happens. Because then it's been field tested."
I can't imagine people preferring to use grammarly rather than just learning how to write for themselves.
Very informative. Thanks.
Oh yeah the early 1900s tarrifs worked splendidly definetely didnt completely go tits up causing Japan to go balistic
I was told tariffs also drove us further into the great depression because it was used as a tool to generate tax revenue for the government. If this is true how does that factor into the discussion?
"For me, I am just not seeing a large scale industrial policy wherein the tariffs can work as a tool to encourage the growth of good paying jobs here at home. Let's take something super mundane: drywall screws. A box of about 500 is going to cost you ~15 dollars or so, give or take depending on quality and brand. The profit margin per screw is stupidly small. No company that makes those screws is going to move stateside, even with tarrifs, because the baseline production cost at home is too high for such a low value-add product. 

Cars, of course, are very much a high value add and might be a good thing to have tariffs to discourage offshoring the production to some other nation, but, if it is still cheaper even with tariffs then the move will still happen. Tariffs, by themselves, won't be enough to convince companies to return to the states"
I don't think he inhaled or exhaled the entirety of explaining
"Tariffs, like all economic tools is incredibly complex. Certainly it has been demonstrated that the outcome is often unexpected. In the case of American tariffs, what is confusing is that they unusually benefited from it. Combine the dollar world order with the ""cheap"" imports. The American consuners were the winners. Work will not return. It will be automated, meaning a few people will get rich whike the rest will pay more and rven have less jobs available. Look luck America."
"They can raise the price but if they do, I won’t buy."
"Industries are today highly specialized making it quite difficult to replace imported high quality industrial products. On would need a factory, tooling, automation, skilled workers etc. It just doesn’t happen overnight."
It’s about having those countries do what the big one wants. China does this as well
very informative thank you !
Thank YOU for giving us an informative breakdown of tariffs free of politically-charged BS
"Tariffs could work, over time, if we exempt raw materials and tools used in the manufacturing process itself, while eliminating income taxes or sales taxes on US goods."
"The issue is that these are long term solutions, not short term. This is about reorientating things away from global supply chains which disproprionately negatively affect the developed world."
"The thing is, back in the days the goods were better quality. So people didn’t have to constantly buy stuff. Nowadays everything breaks easily"
"THREE WORDS:

1.) LIB
2.) UR
3.) AL"
Using tariffs as economic potholes to induce manageable recessions is interesting. let’s see if we manage them well.
The formation of the USA was also about tarrifs between states. So why should nations should have tarrifs between themselves? Why should certain nations discriminate others?
"I remember back 60 years or so when electronics, appliances, cars, steel and a whole lot of other products were made in the USA. Suddenly we started seeing these same products start coming into the US from companies over seas, that were of very high quality but at significantly lower prices. People aren't dumb. When they have a choice, they will choose a lower priced high quality product over a higher priced lessor quality product most of the time. So what happens? American manufacturers start leaving America and moving over seas, taking with them all the jobs that were currently here. Sure, tariffs are going to hurt in the short term but maybe that is what it s going to take to start bringing jobs back to the US."
"Correction at 5:30.  The Southern aristocracy believed Lincoln wanted to end slavery.  Lincoln, however, made it perfectly clear through countless letters and discussions that he would NOT END slavery if that was going to cause the South to secede.  The Southern aristocrats WANTED to secede and they used him as their excuse."
Americans are going to love paying higher prices for everything. Even after you take the tariffs away. There is no incentives to drop the prices again.
"11:00 legislation was the major player over tarrifs for current light truck rules, since MOCA (I think that's how it's spelled) legislation means less innovation is done for light trucks, reducing design and manufacturing costs relative to other cars."
"Tarrifs are bad. That is why most people would never support tarrifs between villages in the same town, cities in a region or regions in a country."
"India continues to be protectionist in key industries but I don’t know that local players have stepped up to compete, they just don’t have a need to. I don’t think the productivity increases from protectionism are guaranteed unless it’s a well thought out plan, and local companies don’t use them as an excuse to take their foot off the gas. It’s consumers that suffer in these cases. I’m thinking of high end electronics and computer parts,  EVs in India’s case…"
You guys did a great analysis on XAI308K in your other video. I agree it will hit $100 by December this year.
"And you haven’t mentioned a possibility (quite high in my opinion) that even if foreign investors are forced to manufacture in the US, the cost of US labour is so high that it justifies very high use of robots instead of humans. I heard from multiple sources that outside of significant reduction of income in the US, it is most likely that those manufacturing jobs will never return."
Smart move. Being that it's new XAI308K will probably hit $0.60 usd by Winter 2025 and next year will boom to like $25. Glad we got in early.
"So how do you rebalance tariffs between countries? If you have low import tariffs on foreign goods but that country has high tariffs on your goods they import to protect their local production. How can you rebalance that? 

Genuine question"
"Just in case none of you know the U.S. can't use the oil it produces, it has to export oil it can't process and import processed oil."
"Why isn't the extended benefit of those 1800 washing machine jobs ever explored? (taxes on those jobs [Income, sales], suppliers that make the parts for the dryers, local economy of those manufacturing plants). Your example is too simplistic. It's why economist will say tariffs are bad but then say they are not really sure what will happen."
Tarifs worked a century ago when globalization did not exist and the international exchange was very small... Which is not the case now
"Tarriffs will make the citizens work hard and learn how to not rely everything from the outside, this is good way for citizens to build its own unique culture."
I got an ad for your documentary on this video 
Stephen Miran seems like a smart guy and a key advisor to Trump on tariffs.  It’s all above my head but he explains the main benefit as lowering the value of the dollar and making manipulating currencies against it harder.
Tariffs worked during Trimp's  first term
"Uh… no… the only thing that’s gonna happen is that imported items are gonna increase in price, so then the local product increase their prices accordingly to match the imported competitors for an increase in revenue, then no one can afford eggs."
3:12 You can’t make one of these graphs without pointing out deadweight loss. They’re made to show it…
At least this man is trying to fix our massive debt problem. Caused by being ripped off by everybody
Great explanation!
You’re right we should just keep shipping all domestic production to foreign countries. Gotta make that graph go up no matter what.
Proud to say I was subscribed since <30k subs
"Tariffs only work if you eliminate income tax at the same time. I'd rather offset income taxes with tariffs and choose what I buy and when I buy it. If income taxes don't get eliminated, then it'll be a horrible mistake."
Youn skipped right over the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930 which of course had major impacts on the great depression not only in the US and Canada but world wide.
"He should be targeting American companies that go abroad for cheap labour and materials, but these companies are just going to move plants or relabel stuff as said in the video and thus avoiding the tariff, without however charging the end customer the tariff price."
I bet this youtuber is a proponent of trickle down economics
"Swapped out $8,000 to my XAI308K wallet. Thanks you guys see you at the summit."
Ask Herbert Hoover.  He signed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs into existence at the start of the depression. I think everyone knows how that ended!
I believe they can work one at a time but to many at once will be a major disruption.
excellent presentation
"Who will Trump blame for the down fall? 
A: DEI 
B: Immigrants 
C:Democrats 
D:Biden"
"So TLDR of basically anything involving economy: X should work, but it doesn't because of greed.

Can't the government pass a price freeze together with tariffs? E.g.: Domestic washing machine is going to be 20% cheaper than an imported one after a 25% tariff. Hence, that price difference is now locked while tariffs are in place. I understand this might cause other issues, but we need a way to keep greed in check, because free market is not doing it."
"The point isn't to reduce taxes, it's to make the current tax system less progressive, taking more money from the people that must spend the majority of their paychecks on consumer goods."
You also miss the fact of big corporations like Apple and Meta moving their profits into Ireland for its low company tax rates. Which appears to be another way to get around tariffs anyway.  Fyi. Laurie. NZ. 
"You haven’t talked about outsourcing == brain drain. Anytime you outsource a job, the outsourcee gains the skill and experience, and the outsourceor gets rusty…. This multiplies over time… eventually, the outsourceor’s skills and tools are outdated, and the outsourcee’s skills and tools are at the bleeding edge of innovation. I’ve never heard this mentioned in economic theory, but I’ve seen it played out in the optics industry. Tariffs can be a tool to mitigate this brain drain. Tarrifs are an easy way to encourage local companies to not outsource. Especially for new and high tech individuals where a competitive advantage is beneficial."
Economists don’t hate tariffs… it’s a study of economic activity
"Trump’s tariffs may create some feel-good moments in the short term, the lasting impact could be slower economic growth, higher costs for consumers, and job losses in industries that depend on international markets. It's the classic example of a policy that looks good on paper but might do more harm than good over time."
People really exposing themselves confidently saying “tariffs don’t work”
Canada and Mexico joining BRICS would be game over
Economic co-dependency between major power like China & USA is probably the only reason a war hasn't happened. There is probably more at risk here than more expensive washing machines.
"It's egregious how, in the discussion of tariffs, raising the wages of U.S. citizens so they can maintain purchasing power is not even mentioned. 

This makes the Trump-imposed tariffs not only a global swindle, it also contributes to more ecological damage due to the middleman country tactic used to mitigate the tarrif price increase."
"It's already working, 2 fast growing Canadian companies just announced they are moving to america"
Not sure how true.  You are I’ve been working in a steel mill for 25 years. And those tariffs really helps us out. China has been dumping. Steel  and many other products here for years.  99 percent of the time it’s poor quality. Compared to. What we make.
"Phase 1: Tariffs
Phase 2: ????
Phase 3: Profit"
"i think the part where it fucks it all up is when the domestic company raises to match the tariffed product.......if both washing machines start at $485, but then bc of the tariff, japan brand needs to go up to $675. By also going up to $675 all the american company is doing is forcing the entire market to consider if they really need a new washer and then making it unimportant to the consumer of where it came from. But if they would leave their price at $485, well now everyone is buying not only the cheaper option but the one MADE IN AMERICA. Now american production can grow, the company add jobs and now all that new money added to the market from those new employees goes on to raise sales and profits for other brands"
Every tariffs works but all of them is a two edged sword.
"13:59 ""cheap domestic labor"" is such a cowardly economist way of not saying slavery"
"Blanket tarrifs do have a use... To prep an economy for a war or embargo or basically to prevent a ""cold turkey"" situation"
"Perhaps im ignorant but its very clear why he put such strong tarrifs on Canada and Mexico. Its because they are the main foreign suppliers of crude oil for the U.S.A. Trump has always been about targeting energy back to the U.S. this will force America to reinvigorate the production of energy (oil) which is the basis for manufacturing. 

The energy price to operate far succeeds the wage difference. If manufacturing companies in the U.S save on energy then they will actually be able to afford the wages needed to pay the workers....at least this is what is hoped.

This isnt a battle about avacados, onions, and candian  alcholol this is about jumpstarting oil production in the USA.

Good idea or bad? I have no clue...."
Can we please elect you to manage all this?
"Tarriffs make products more expensive. Making them more expensive, they should just be a repellent for people to away from the products that are under the power. Therefore it should just decrease the amount of products being purchased"
Try US shipbuilding industry. Jone's act did number on that one.
"The previous traiffs were relatively short term. Not long enough to bring production back home. Hopefully, this time they'll work. If not oh well, we cam change plans"
Competition is needed and to gain more competition you need less regulation to entice people to start a business. Red tape detours competition.
"Also not every import or export is a consumer good. What happens to services US exports ? I think it will backfire heavily. More surgical tariffs on specific product categories may be reasonable, though"
You have to consider the real motive of the tariffs. Its personal gains and power that comes with money. They want people to pay more.
"Gotta think about how tariffs impact a world where 3D printing, AI and robotics have taken over. What are the possibilities?"
"Honestly, Mexico, Canada, the EU and whoever else should just deal with the tariffs, put on proportionate retaliatory ones and wait him out. He probably wouldn't keep them going four years if it meant sky-high inflation, but even if he did, the next president wouldn't. As painful as a recession is, I'm sure the concessions he's demanding are also awful and would last longer. In the meantime, like-minded countries should decouple and reduce reliance on the US."
Tariffs worked great in the 60s and 70s we had All-American products American made cars no Chinese or Japanese junk . People in their forties and younger don't even understand how tariffs work
The only way I can see this benefiting United Statians is if there is a proportional reduction in income tax.. Which is a stated goal of the pres.. The reduced bureaucratic load on companies could also have a significant impact on United Statian's ability to focus on production/progress.  So hoping for our neighbors that the gov follows through with step 2 of that plan..
"I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this topic but, when reading a lot of these comments, it feels weird that people are kinda saying that they want to continue to exploit the cheap labor and terrible working conditions of China. Did we all forget about the suicide nets and sweat shops?"
"So far he's not using tariffs like that, he's using them as a punishment for not doing what he asks."
"For me, the only real argument is national defense. Being cut off from something like semiconductors would be a disaster for the US so it would make sense in an industry like that. But blanket tariffs are just insane.

Another point, I heard Tim Cook explaining why Apple still produces in China, and it isn't because of cost but expertise and infrastructure. He claims the US has nowhere close to level of expertise than China has. This is something that takes years to cultivate. Idk, maybe you can make the argument it's better in 10 years but that's a big ""if"""
"At 1:02 a picture of my hometown, Pittsburgh. Looking at downtown from across the Monongahela just past a brew pub called the Sly Fox on Great Allegheny Passage street. Thanks."
Making our own steel is more important than making dryers
"And after all that, the Chinese products will still provide more value for consumers after price hike"
"Trump also tariffed Canadian heavy crude oil, which has no American replacement. The oil the US can produce is too light to be used in our refineries and has to be blended with heavy Canadian oil in order to be used. We physically cannot produce significant amounts of heavy crude oil since the oil deposits simply don't exist in the US anymore.

In this case the tariff is just a straight up tax, there's no possible way for domestic industry to replace the import."
"The case for tariffs in the 19th-century was not very convincing.  In fact, one could even argue that tariffs were to blame for the outbreak of the Civil War."
"With that many components involved, relying solely on US manufacturing just isn’t feasible. Global supply chains exist for a reason."
Drinking game: take a shot every time he says “tariff”
"Tariffs worked back in the 1800s, but supply chains are global right now. There are some things we simply cannot and never will be able to produce, mine, or grow at scale to satisfy even domestic demand (notably, much of our semiconductor business, which literally powers virtually every electronic product we own and use to live). I wouldn't be opposed to imposing tariffs on China - their state-sponsored companies can steal industry secrets, their goods are often priced to undercut competition, and they undermine US manufacturing as a result. However, there are certain things we simply cannot mine or produce at the scale of China, most importantly rare earth metals which are necessary for virtually every motorized or electric device we use. Even if we started a vast device recycling program, the price of actually extracting and refining those materials for reuse would likely be just as if not more expensive than just buying from china at higher prices."
Tariffs work at making consumers broke. There goes the consumer spending sector of the economy.
Great insights!
Guess we're about to find out.
"Right. So tell me why all of my ""USA"" products (DeWalt, Apple,) is actually ""made in China"" or. How comes when i try to buy something from the US where the prices are pretty competitive, but then the Shipping cost is so high it makes the whole purchase nonsense?"
"The short of it: ""No""

The long of it: ""Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"""
Tariffs cannot decrease purchasing power without extortion. This is a law of all trades and economies.
"Its about reshoring jobs, not dollars and cents. The benefit is down the road. Just like the issues with sending the jobs across the world took years to manifest, fixing it will too."
"Yes it can, because Mexico just caved in and agreed to Trumps terms."
Seems to me that there should be policy preventing US companies from raising costs as explained in the washing machine example
"I would rather pay 20% in the form of tariffs for everything I buy, and not pay the 21% income tax or capital gains.  Because I make way more then I spend it would be a huge tax cut for me."
Can you make a video on the benefits or not of a cyrpto reserve for a country?
"I have some questions. Isn't the point of tariffs to encourage more companies to manufacture in the US, which would improve our industry, create jobs, and make us less dependent on foreign manufacturing? I'm not sure there's anyone arguing that tariffs are intended to drive consumer end prices down. Also, and we will have to wait and see what happens, but isnt the other intention of tariffs to replace our current federal funding mechanism? Like, reduce or eliminate income tax and revert back to pre 1913? I'm all for spending a little more on goods if i get to keep more of my income, assuming a net benefit. This would depend on your spending habits i assume but that comes down to personal choice. Im just not seeing the reason for debating a point no one disagrees with. Am i missing something?"
"""it would increase costs for the consumer with out bringing jobs back to America, which is the whole point"" no... the point is to justify income tax cuts which have a net negative for 90% of the population, pretty neutral effects for another 5-9% leaving the top 1% to maybe top 5% to save millions a year, each, while consumers pay a disproportionately high percentage of their income to the government, through tariffs."
"I don't think the argument of ""we need to exploit overseas slave labor and poor working conditions so we can have cheap stuff"" is a good one, personally."
I got my XAI308K wallet setup and got in for $7500. Great video 
Is the price to consumers offset by lower income taxes? How much?
"I think 11:45 is a huge key here. Tariffs reduce international competition, so if there's enough competition in domestic industry then they can work. That requires restrictions on large corporations while allowing smaller ones to flourish.

The issue is trump is pro-corporation, and we have several domestic monopolies + tariffs. Plus trump has no idea what America's accessible natural resources are - those are the industries we should be targeting with tariffs. We're about to get much shittier, much more expensive products while the government and domestic CEOs get tons of money through ""indirect taxes""."
"depending on how much tariffs impact, i still might prefer them over income tax.
i have the freedom to choose not to buy the more expensive product. i do NOT have the freedom to avoid paying income taxes."
"South American here - where inflation isn't just a concept, it's a way of life. Once prices go up, they never come back down, that's the new normal, even if inflation slows. Seems like a wake-up call for my American friends. Right now, the president here has a 49% disapproval rate despite record-high employment and inflation under 4%. Why? Because the cost of basic goods is still sky-high. Be careful what you wish for."
Answer: Yes.
"I'm curious why this video was only from the USA perspective.  What happened in Europe or China?  If another country is ""playing"" unfairly, for example China subsidizing an industry to kill international competition, don't tariffs make sense in that case?  You can't compete if the other company gets free money from their government."
"By what basis can you say that the necessary tax surplus would not be created?  This also isn't being done to lower income tax, it is being done to ELEMINATE federal income taxation and that is a very big distinction.  Getting a 25-30% pay increase will offset a 10-15% increase in the price of SPECIFIC goods.  If you are dramatically impacted economically by that increase in goods prices even with increased pay then you are already in a terminal financial situation no matter what happens.  This also ignores the insane bloat and corruption of the federal budget.  Once that is reigned in the overall cost required to keep the federal government functioning will be dramatically reduced.  China is also an adversarial nation in rapid decline, who has basically declared war so decoupling from them economically is also an important strategy."
Trump only had to levy tariffs on Canada and Mexico for five minutes…
"To EVERY U.S. importer: Band together and ""Just Don't Pay"" any tariff, new or old, ever again. There is safety in numbers."
"Phase 1: collect underpants 
Phase 2:
Phase 3: profit"
"The graph you had about tariffs throughout the last 200 years shows an instant huge dip after each spike. This means it did work, for a very short time, resulting in prices of things just sky rocketing. Tariffs DO NOT WORK! it's a selfish way. It creates a constant rise in prices..."
Tariff may not be a good thing but it WORKS AND WORKS VERY WELL AND EFFECTIVE.
"I laugh at the lack of critical thinking in society these days.  You can talk about complicated economic policy all day, but the elephant in the room is that the US consumer is the number one consumer on Earth.  If foreign companies have a large percentage of their revenue come from US consumer markets, and their product or service is not a necessity, they could be in big trouble.  Never underestimate your customer base and their ability to prioritize their needs."
It is causing a stock market crash which is not a good thing right now.
"Im definitely not smarter than alot of these people, but as an everyday individual, its pretty obvious to me that companies that are slapped with a 25% hit to their margin, will increase prices by 25% as a base. Might as well tack on another 5% for extra profits. The world also mostly works with monopolies, so the competition is already dead. We will take on these tariffs."
"I thought tariffs are only applied against products and not countries. Can you explain the principle of ""Most favoured nation"" and how it applies to Trumps tariff strategy?"
"I think there maybe two things you did not take into consideration, I could be wrong. 
1: does this negatively effect China’s product dumping? 
2: is the hurt that American consumers feel less than what Chinese producers feel?"
"It only hurts consumers. Companies just push the extra cost ""tax"" to the consumers.. nothing changes besides consumers paying 3x for the same thing"
"the VAST majority of government funding should come trough tariffs / vat and corporate taxation, plus a taxation on land. NOT trough income tax ... as it was intended .."
I just found it weird how countries who have their own unfair tarrifs are now complaining about tariffs. Just seems hypocritical.
"Short answer: No
Long answer:NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO"
"Tariffs on luxurie goods a probably fine. Stuff like food, hygiene, healthproducts and so on should probably best left alone."
"Raising tariffs is obviously trumps way of weaking consumer purchasing powers and strengthening asset value; furthering the divide between rich and poor even more. This allows the rich to upcharge essentials like education, healthcare and public services untill the only way people can afford them is by selling their assets (materials, possessions, houses etc). Houses most critically, so the rich can purchase others land to again increase their asset value. Its a cycle that slowly takes more and more away from the consumer."
"If us put tariff on China alone us citizen can survive its after effects.. But its  3 countries, mainly 2 are neighboring"
"I was hoping your video would be a little more in-depth. Unfortunately, you only focus on USA tariffs. It would have been nice if you included current cost of tariffs that all countries charge the USA."
That thumbnail  love it
"Key point (specifically with regards to businesses passing the rising costs due to tariffs onto consumers): the power ALWAYS lies with the customers.
Businesses are faced with two options; raise the prices to pay tariffs, or move to the US. 
WE WANT THEM TO MOVE PRODUCTION TO THE US. NOT RAISE PRICES.
so how do we do it? DON'T BUY EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS. 
If you pay the higher prices you have nobody to blame but yourself for the higher costs. 
Don't blame the government, because tarrifs have the potential of being a FANTASTIC solution to fixing all the inflation that the democrats create through creating a greater divide between the poor and the wealthy. But it will never work if we keep giving these companies our money rather than forcing them to be better. 
We have the opportunity to help pay off all the debts, fix the money printing problem that the last administration plagued us with, which will in turn lower inflation. 
But we have to be vigilant.
If you don't buy from foreign companies that raise their prices, they will be forced to comply and help the economy, if you DO buy from them, you are giving into these greedy companies and you are the sole reason for your own higher cost of living. NOT the tariffs.
Tarrifs are great, it is us, the people, that are contributing to rising costs.
You don't need to our financial education to see that, just think about it simply. If you were a business and were faced with tariffs to import to the US, would you raise the prices so you didn't have to lose profit, or would you move your factories to the US? The answer is simple. Unless you are forced to do so, you're going to keep manufacturing over seas and save your bottom line. So its up to us to force them to move to USA to continue making profits. DON'T BUY PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES (until they eventually give in and move to US to remain competitive).
It's not an anti-foreginers thing, it's a pro-economy thing. If you want to be able to afford food, then force the supply chain to drop prices by only buying American. They will set up shop in USA, and create job opportunities and it will be a much better thing for the world then them trying to be as cheap as possible and passing those costs down to you thus draining the economy."
"I got the weirdest add i have ever seen in YT an add about this very channel playing in this channel, never once seen an add well advertise about itself on its own channel "
"People try to predict the economy not realizing it is not a capitalistic market, its a command economy, central planning! my concern is, instead of having much dollar in bank that could lose value to inflation, do I save in gold to reserve and grow wealth for now, or just hang on?"
You may want to look at the Smoot-Hawley tariff act of 1930 and compare it to what DonOLD is doing today.
Tariff Is 'the Most Beautiful Word'
"I think the tariffs are great, they will greatly accelerate the ongoing fall of the US global hegemony."
"Old news , they already worked."
I don’t think people realize how powerful the US is. This won’t last long.
Do a video on land value taxes please!
"We should place a tariff on internet traffic.
That'll show em!"
"This is being done, I suspect, as a means of shrinking the USA federal deficit which is projected to reach never before seen levels over the next 5 years"
could yu do a video on how wood or what goes into a house went from 6000 for a home to 1mil nowadays. when a house waas like buying a car to what it is todday. how can wood go up in proice sooo much so fast. and the economics behind that. or when tariffs are imposed or the word inflation comes about that manf whom are not affected by them raise prices just cause its expected. and the compoiunding effectrs it has over time due to numerous events occurring.
We made the Mercedes packs in Alabama also. I was there doing it in 2012
"Tariffs support inefficient domestic production, lead to higher costs for consumers and lead to poor product quality - despite paying full sticker price. As someone who's lived in India (which is a high tariff country) for most of my life, it's a little difficult for me to understand why the Trump administration wants to emulate the policies of a developing country.

Has it occurred to them that passing high tariff policies is what has made India poor long term?"
Tariffs could boost eco make foreign product prices rise and local products stay same.
"Tariff only burden customers if they purchase the good - the short term complication, but long term is more beneficial, it will reduce demands (mean it will get cheaper, it also balance the wealth as only rich will purchase it), it also in long term create necessity thus rising of domestic products..brace yourselves for the short term hiccup, save your money only for necessary items."
"Were you being serious when you said that the market for American pickup trucks is not as competitive or innovative as it should be?  I have to assume that this perspective is because you are on the outside looking in, with your own biases looking at it through a lens colored by your own domestic market.  

Our domestic pickup truck market is fiercely competitive and when left alone it innovates to give our consumers what they want.  It is usually government intervention that causes it to ""innovate"" in ways that the market does not want, such as the recent regulatory push for EV pickups."
"While you are all distracted with tariff bluffs, your rights are going bye bye.  Do not be distracted from the attack on every citizen."
Tariffing Canada is like tariffing Michigan.  Same effect.
Pretty obvious the threat of them can.
"Flat Tariffs are stupid, adaptive Tariffs are way better were you increase the price a little bit so then Domestic and oversea goods are closer in price so it's easier to chose local but the cheaper option is still there."
:57 intensification is an argument to determine and establish a tariff
"Let's hope Trump will be careful with his tariffs. However, something needed to be done about Mexico and especially Canada, so I get why we're here Today. Protect your country from criminals and dictators, important and warranted move from Trump there."
"So far colombia, panama and mexico had bend their knees. Looking good. For Trudeau, i dont know. Looks like he doesnt know what he’s doing, looking forward for polievre’s leadership."
Why is it that it's ok for other countries to tariff us but we shouldn't tariff them?
"Did you know that tariffs can bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for the US government in a short period of time? Although such money is paid by US import companies, it does bring in some revenue for the US government, taking money out of the pockets of ordinary people."
Calling it an indirect tax because costs go up is pretty distorted.
"I’m no economist, but didn’t the gilded age, where robber barons and monopolies ran amuck, end in the Great Depression?"
"Tariffs: Good when we do it, Bad when they do it"
"The reason he wants this stuff is because he wants to rely less on other countries. No more buying stuff, but instead we'll make most of everything"
My opinion on XAI308K it will reach double digits heights may take time but the hand writing is on the wall
All I know is that I'm paying MORE now for gas and food than I ever did.
Seeing AI generated videos and images interspersed with actual stock footage is unsettling.
nice information but what solution do you offer
So swinging a wrench around aimlessly won’t help you fasten a nut or screw?
"Tarrifs explained plain and simple
China sells lets say Tshirt to America for 10 dollars. 
America buys it for 10 dollars, sells it for 15 dollars 
America imposes 25% tax.
Now Tshirt costs 12.5 dollars to get from China
America buys it for 12.5 dollars and sells it for 17.5
China doesnt lose money at this point, its American consumers that losing the money."
"When It comes to infant industry protection I like Ha Joon Chang's analogy. ""Nobody wants to send their kid to work at 8, but you don't want them living in your basement at 30"".

Protectionism is a good tool for developimg economies but not so good for developed ones."
But couldn’t many of those negative effects of the tariffs had also been from COVID and data is being miss represented in those studies? I would not be surprised if a necessary industry like steel would have kept going but I remember that on many sites our company was on building just stopped. You would also think most businesses using steel in factories that made non-essential goods would have experienced the same thing. And there was a huge squeeze on jobs then generally.
🇧🇷 XAI308K going to hit record highs as soon as the presale is over. US investors rush to get into XAI308K.
very well put video
He really just wants to use Tariffs to get rid of income taxes.  Basically replacing taxes on himself with a sales tax on all of us
"You missed out the benefit businesses would gain from lower energy prices, that would probably negate alot of what you talked about."
"Lets say tariffs do their job and companies will look to manufacture more in the US. With what labour? There is already a labour shortage in many ideas, many people are looking to leave, others are being removed."
"Tariffs are tax’s. 

Taxation is theft.

Hope this helps "
Tariffs are here to help the big corporations make more money
"I don't think he's really going to do most of these Tariffs..  
He's just forcing people to the negotiating table from a place of leverage...  
If they don't give in to what he wants, then those Tariff threats will actually carry forward."
"I know the channel is about econimics but as a European I cannot help but worry about how Trump phrased it, like it's our fault for not buying stuff we don't need."
"Guys, u dont understand basic. Good will be cost 25% more, but this 25% of price goes to government budget! This is main reason.  Its working as tax for all non domestic goods, parts, and materials."
"Yikes, this went up like what 6 hours before they worked with mexico doing what the president wanted. So yes, to save people time of watching they do work."
Make prices higher again!
"Inspired by the 19th century


Like things that led us into the depression?"
"Well, they certainly raise the price point for consumers PERMANENTLY....so there is that."
They are bad when inflation is already high!
"How much will it cost Apple to determine which iPhone is made entirely in India, entirely in China and which components of all iPhones are made in China?"
"Short answer no, long answer noooooo!"
Maybe you should have mentioned that back then we were not in a fiat system.
They should lower taxes for companies who leave and tax companies who leave
"Americans want to ""buy in America"" until they have to buy in America."
"Whenever tariffs are mentioned, I think of the Australian vehicle manufacturing. Expensive, mediocre quality, and always lagging imports on technology. Never again."
"yeah but big companies can get even more recording record profits, record profits that have never been so record"
These comments are a bunch of non-economists with TDS predicting commodity futures. Love it.
YALL VOTED FOR THIS!!!
This aged like milk in less than 48 hours that's a new record
"I think this video misses the point. It focuses on how tarriffs affect one industry, not a blanket application to a nation."
"A secondary implication is the degradation of diplomatic relationships between countries.

 As long as ive been alive, canada and the US have been great allies and have had a gpod relationship. It's too bad that that's jeopardized now."
"So, Tariffs in today's economy translate to wealth redistribution from consumers to the federal government. Got it. 
I'm sure lowering the corporate tax rate again will also help families put food on the table..."
"In a bottle, yes tariffs are bad for consumers. But please don't forget the opposite of tariffs: subsidies. I think the idea of today's tariffs, is to counteract the subsidies policy of China. Remember, companies in China are partially owned by the state. This onto itself is unfair competition. If you include the fact that a lot of companies are also getting subsidies from the state(for example the car industry in China gets advantageous energy prices, in comparison with other industries in China), you can see why tariffs could be a good idea to level the play field, to be able to compete. So yeah, in a 100% fair economy, tariffs are a bad thing. But we are not living in a fair world economy, are we?"
In order to protect domestic industries those industries have to actually exist
The people watching this arent the people who need to watch this.
A key trait of conservatives is implementing policies that are proven to fail because it 'feels' like the 'best' thing to do.
"It's hard to find a single case in history where tariffs worked. It was tried many times in USA by other presidents, but always let to economic downfall. So either people can believe, that one person somehow will make things work which never worked  before, or that his goal is different. It can't be proven, but during crisis rich people get richer, average and poor become more poor. While Trump and his friends as true businessman profit, poor people cheer for him, because he ""made america look strong""."
"If you want to ruin your own industry, yes."
"To be honest, ill much rather pay more for something that lasts 5 years than pay hlf the price for a tenth of the lifespan."
"Tl:dr
The US industrial economy was boosted by two world wars, helping rebuild Europe & the booming car and home electronic industry.

Tariffs only ever helped as a stop gap for protectionistic industrial sectors."
"Should tariffs be imposed by the EU, Canada and China on US goods to balance out the US imposed tariffs?"
"I don't think people realize that most working class people in the US live paycheck to paycheck. This is very bad and very unstable. 

Asking poor people to tighten their belts for the coming storm that wont bother you at all is absolutely insane. 

Whats even more insane is the number of poor people who have actually been gaslit into supporting this catastrophe. 

The next couple years will open some eyes once and for all. Silver lining."
Why did Canada not build its own LNG plants and oil export facilities? Why did Canada tie itself to the USA for all its export routes?
"yes everyone takes advantage of USA and tariffs our goods, no one complains about that, this is long over due"
Why can’t we get this type of information from news organizations 🥹
You can’t grow bananas in Minnesota.
"1.6 million views, 40k likes... Yeah, that tells you how people feel about tariffs."
wasnt aware he planned to go 25% tariffs all around ... i don't think it is a good idea to go so high .. MAYBE 5 or 10% .. but not 25%
US governors should retake Economics 101
"The most important parts of the argument is missed:
1) Who does the ""counting""? We are also told that the US has the worst neonatal care in the western world. However, if one looks to see HOW baby deaths are counted, then you will see the US has the HIGHEST care. France. for instance, doesn't count any baby that is thought to have no chance of survival while the US counts EVERY baby regardless. The Friedman side is basically hoisted by their own petard. Tariffs and their effects are too complex to actually know exactly what the effects are. They are just estimations.
2) The poker problem. If you do not think tariffs have their place, then you must think you can play poker against a billionaire when you are just a normal person without betting limits. The US can't not compete against a world that has as much slavery as it does. And make no mistake about it. China uses slave labor.

I could go on, but why? If economic ideas would work, then this country wouldn't have been hollowed out by NAFTA."
"interesting, for a govt that claims it works based on 'commonsense', tarrifs increasing jobs is'nt really commonsense..it is much more nuanced..But you get what you voted for, enjoy the high costs"
"11:14 Light trucks have higher profit margins because they aren't held to the same standards as other vehicles.

That tariff is there because Europe put a tariff on our chickens."
"No need to worry about consumers, just protect the domestic business conglomerates and further push the US into a true plutocracy."
MAGA will do the job.
"US could only tax the land and nothing else. It would be 6-7 cents per square meter per year, and they would have the same 6trillion$ budget.
Seems fair to me, you would be taxing the land since private property forbids anybody else to use it."
I like how suddenly everyone wants to talk about tariffs like we haven't always had them. Obama and Biden had tariffs. None of this is anything new.
"While there are certain things I may agree with Trump on, tariffs on everyone is not one of them. They will take years to work, if they do at all, and will cause too much economic pain in the interim on lower income people."
Ya that graph at 3:16 paired with that explanation could get you sent too a prison. It does not do that. That is insanity.
"But guess what, they worked"
But if something is produced in America with American materials then prices won’t increase right?
"Did tariff's actually work in the past for the U.S. , didn't tariffs make the great depression even worse than it already was ?"
It works.
Let's all trust a guy who bankrupted a casino twice.  And was allowed to fail upwards because of his father's huge safety net.  Long point short.  Most tariffs will have a negative impact on the US consumer.
"So this is what media's gonna be like for four years. ""Can mass-deportation actually be humane???"" coming up"
"Not the cherry-picked washing machine data again.  I am slow, but I am learning about biases in studying small samples.  Prices went up, started retreating down, and then COVID."
Most people criticising Trump's use of tariffs don't even seem to know that the dems kept the majority of his tariffs in place.
"If wages have stagnated, then why is domestic labor so expensive?"
Thank you !
Do you ha e references to The FED papper of washing machines?
"Thanks for the forecast! Could you help me with something unrelated: My okx wallet holds some USDT, and I have the seed phrase: (tag suit turtle raccoon orange fever main skull special hungry crystal mixture). What's the way to send them to Binance?"
The zero-sum game is not the leading economic theory since the times of East India Company
"The short-term issues with the tariffs are apparent; but the overarching problem here is that the US economy consistently operates at a massive deficit. Our prosperity is fake.

The only reason the us economy hasn't collapsed yet is because the USD is the world reserve currency (which is presently the case for a whole other list of reasons); effectively meaning the negative impacts of US economic policy are being distributed across most of the worlds population, rather than the US exclusively.

You might be able to argue that this status quo is preferable; but the reality is that the rest of the world will only tolerate so much more of this until they decide to leverage something else, like the Chinese Yuan, as the de facto reserve currency; at which point, it's game over.

The reality is that Americans are too comfortable and do not produce anywhere near enough value to afford their lifestyles; and Trump's tariffs appear to be the softest way to incentivize americans to take on risk and produce value; even if they do have a suite of temporal negative effects"
Short answer. No. They never worked
In the end its a matter of if the American people are willing to suffer short term for long term benefit
Tariffs is the bulwark of mercantilism. It makes people poorer.
"As a Canadian, I'd say this is a negotiating tactic but I am not a fan of it"
but but but............he's playing 4D chess! You don't understand! lol!
"Imagine employing your people to produce your own product using your own currency and resources and that currency system and resources make you the richest in the world, while simulatenously making your workers the most valuable and productive in the world as well; then imagine the rest of the world raiding your bread basket while also begging for aid.

No mention in this video of the current tariff systems that are emplaced, monitored and publicized for the entire world to see on global gov websites... Public info!

Canada and Mexico are FAFO, they are at a 50 billion and 150 billion  defecit annually, not counting aid or rebate. Every nation in the world employs tariffs, the US is just now about to BOOM!

How many acres of land, how many acres of substrate, how many offshore acres does your your country have? If its less than the USA your opinion does not count."
"Depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. Pissing off the entire world and tanking your own economy, then, yes they work great!"
"The US has to choose between Financial Capitalism and Industrial Capitalism. One cancels the other, so we cannot do both!"
Tariffs only work when you pair it with regulation mandating production of goods domestically. Japan does a lot of this
spoiler... it did... mexico will be sending troops to secure the border
"Man, I agree with Trump and Trumpers.  It is about time we showed the world what we can do.   No components,  none should be from a non-domestic source.  Every component, every single screw, every chip, everything, should be from the US.   Not only that, but all labor should be from the US - none of this near-shore, off-shore nonsense.  I mean everything, including all the raw materials, the silicon, the iron, the plastics, mined, refined by US companies.   The bulldozer used to get the raw materials?  Only use 100% US machinery.  Only US mines and domestic sources.  If the materials, machinery, or skills don't exist?  Then screw it, we will do without.  The Amish live just fine and so will we."
"Tariffs kept automotive ""jobs"" in the States. I could introduce you to a few hundred American auto workers pulling underpaid non-union 66 hr weeks today. But hey, they're ""employed"", right?"
They already have.
The tariffs will definitely work to hurt the poor and middle class.
We should avoid tariffs on raw/refined materials
Got in early because XAI308K is already predicted to pass $2 by June.
Great video
"The former chmn. of the Council on Econ. Advisers says tariffs will add 80-cents ($0.80) to a tank full of gas for your car. I'm willing that pay that to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl which is killing 100,000 of our teenagers and young people EVERY YEAR!"
People should read von Mises more
"The biggest issue with the Trump tariffs, specifically, is that he doesn’t seem to understand what they’re for. His blanket “tariffs on everything” policy will be an economic disaster."
"If the forecast over 50% of jobs will be replaced either by AI, automation or a combination of both, which means income tax will drop by 50% and welfare payment will increase."
Sure they'll work. They will work in making everything much much more expensive.
"Taxing Canadians and Mexicans though is a stupid idea, especially 25%, if i was Canadian i would drive to the US, buy a shed load of iphones and sneakily get them back to Canada, loads of money to be made..."
Or you implement a lawa staying that American producers cannot price match products with a tariff. So many holes in multiple aspects you tried to lay out
Empires will be needed again.  Old colonies will not be developed and secured as before but “partnerships” will look more inhuman than our current situation. No money? No problem we have forced labor.
"Seeing how the peso is down against the USD by 20% year over year and the Canadian dollar is down about 10%, tariffs are a logical step to balance the devaluation of their currencies. Fast forward a day or two, and Mexico and Columbia agreed to meet the terms to avoid tariffs anyway."
So why is it OK for other countries to tariff the US but it is not all right for the US to tariff other countries?
"Yes, they can."
We are now a few months away from XAI308K launching - Elon Musk said the presale is over soon!! Get in while you can
Fun Fact: Rarely impacts the rich! Definitely impacts the average people.
I think these tariffs are to make American manufacturers stronger but not in a good way. They will only get stronger bc the foreign competition was removed not bc they got better.
Argentina and tarrifs to protect domestic industry didn't work out great for Argentina... Inflation followed...
"Smoot Hawley act... oh, it had an effect all right"
"I don't think I have anything American made in my house, maybe some parts that were necessary for construction but even then"
"The best way to bring more jobs to the USA is to bring more factories to US, and tariffs is no longer the right way for to do that. 

The best way is cut of the taxes to the companies, many companies will transfer their production to the USA, the right is it be zero taxes to the companies, it will force a good competition between countries to attract the companies, if cut the taxes to the companies it means the products will be cheaper, and the people will get a good benefit from that competition. 

This is basic, however, government just ignore that fact. 

Another thing is, cut of the federal income tax or it should be a little just to self defense only, as Israel does, the cost to be the cops on the world is to high for us US citizen, and today no-one wants to be those sponsors anymore."
The abbreviation for billion is B.
"You have put an American flag on a Danish ship in the thumbnail. Kinda ironic, if Maersk stopped docking in the US they would really feel it. And it’s not far out of the realms of possibility if Trump doesn’t back off from Greenland."
"I'm not a democrat, not even murrican, but republicans have stated in the topic of small government, but they always make it bigger."
"Idk I work for a European food distributor, it’s going to be good for us in Canada"
You also neglected to mention the pollution and slave labor of a lot of these foreign companies.
"i am pretty sure that question was asked around 7 years ago, and the answer is gave 7 years later and it is; no, it doesn't work."
"Step two: No tariffs, just kidding with step one."
The fact that nobody sees this as a negotiation tool is hilarious. It's a salesman's tactic to get things at the price he wants. If people voted for him for how much better he had the economy let him do his job. The man is literally a business man that's what he specializes in. He negotiated himself to president he negotiated himself to a billionaire negotiated himself out of court cases I believe I would let him do the negotiations especially if you're not a billionaire or a business person I'm telling you if nothing else I can tell you he's got this part of it in the bag.
"As always, the US does not have an income problem. It has a spending problem."
"I think this review is heavily biased. You are evaluating short term impact as if that is a valid measure of the tariff's effectiveness. The ""rust belt"" didn't form overnight, and it won't be rebuilt overnight."
Dramatic Tariffs threats in todays complex international trades are unwise. More damage than good and domestic consumers pay the price.
Can and will are two different things and at what cost to us.
"It's one thing to levy tarrifs on the likes of China, large countries with cheap manufacturing... It's another to use the US's size to bully smaller allies (who are already struggling FAR more than the US is atm) with tariffs.
The political and social fallout will be severe and long-lasting."
It's on the premise that other countries will give in and bow to Trump in return. He never meant to actually enforce the tariff.
"""Where tariffs will be placed on things that never were and never can be made in the domestic economy.""
What a back asswards concept.   The point of tariffs is to encourage domestic manufacturing, not make more expensive things that never were and never can be made in the domestic economy. That's just ridiculous.  Tariff laws must include a clause that loophole avoidance (such as the flat pack example in the video) should be penalized appropriately."
Why did you completely skip tariffs in the 1930s and how they made the Great Depression worse?
"Lol, prices rose more than the cost of the tariffs, why am I not surprised?"
How about we just shrink big government spending instead of trying different ways to raise the money for corrupt government?
I'm not longer eating out no buying of anything non necessary I would no longer buy paper towel instead will use table cloth and just wash it after
"If Tariffs only hurt the domestic economy, why has mexico and canada been tariffing us HUNDREDS of percentage points on products? Tariffs are good for thee, but not for me?

Other countries have been taking advantage of the US for DECADES. And the US has just taken it while our domestic manufacturing has been gutted and lives destroyed with fentanyl. NO MORE. BRING ON THE TARIFFS."
"I think many people are making the mistake of taking Trump/Musk at face value. It's definitely a mistake to think either of them is stupid and doesn't know how damaging things like blanket tariffs can be. It's Trump's version of ""gunboat diplomacy,"" where he gets what he really wants because everyone knows he is prepared to take action that everyone else would think insane. Getting Panama to leave the Chinese Belt and Road scheme being a good example."
"No. They don't work lol.

Love how us gives 25% to friends and 10% to enemies"
Maybe tarifs ilustrate the paradox of thrift
"Companies will use this as a means to price gouge, even if they only last a few weeks. Wait until Tim and Cindy from Indiana who voted MAGA find out how much we depend on Can/Mex for food."
"Tariffs can work great, when you target products you can source elsewhere, like canada is doing. They way umber grimace is doing things, he thinks he can make every country his enemy and still thrive. The problem is they didnt leave a better option to source things like lumber, and america can only meet about half its own needs, and that imdustry is heavily staffed by immigrants that he is chasing away, so how is that supposed to work?"
Your other video mentioned XAI308K being the #1 investment this year. While i do agree can you provide insight on XRP and it's projections?
"Can tariffs actually work? Yes, they can.
Will they work? Quite unlikely."
"It's a national security issue, so simple economic calculus does not apply."
the answer: yes
Looking forward paying $60k for a base model toyota corolla.
"Well Columbia, Panama, and Mexico all backed down and Trump backed off of them after they agreed to renegotiate so it seems to be working so far."
A sneaky way to tax the consumer? It's not sneaky at all lol.
"MAGA be like: ""This won't affect me. I buy American.""
I guess they're not fans of food."
"If I watch this video and the creator isn’t familiar with the Austrian school, imma be sad."
"4:55 ""Tariff of Abominations"" That sounds awesome"
"Funny how this is even a debate at this point. If they didn't work, no country would use them. Clearly, they work."
He called the wrench a spanner ;)
"Tariffs won't increase wages, so let capitalism destory itself."
Tarrifs can work if he abolishes the income taxes and regulations.
Nope. No logic in taxes. Except thieves logic.

"At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for Trump's insane ""strategy"" to even have a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products Americans buy today (or the components that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years; a lot of private and government investment; and lower cost labor (more legal immigration) to reverse the trend that drove the production of consumer products to China and Mexico in the late 90s and early 00s."
"Just to get this straight, when a political hopeful; Kamala Harris says she wants to raise taxes on American corporations. Thats not a bad thing, it doesn’t increase costs right? 

When another politician puts what is basically a tax on foreign companies, we all totally understand how to impacts prices, since those corporations just pass along the added cost of the tariff (tax). 

Is everyone this stupid?"
"Can Tariffs work as a Boycott? Price goes up to buy from Said country, So American companies buy from other country.... defacto enforcing a boycott"
"The depths of intention lying in this video is amazing but this entire argument agaisnt tarrifs boils down to one single thing it doesn't matter if a product is a dollar or a million dollars if you have no job you can't afford it. It doesn't matter if chinese goods are 99% cheaper than American made goods, if as in American you make no income due to that job being shipped overseas you can't afford either. It's pure ignorance to be agaisnt tarrifs"
"Tariffs = money to government 
Least efficient entity=governments n monopolies 
Who pays the tariffs = consumers in this case low n mid income households 
Who loses= companies that now have more red tape people who pay
Outcome= inflation poor poorer mid class worse off drug cartels happy- sales increase cause population can’t cope n do more drugs and cartels  do not pay tariffs"
"why is this #36 trending and not #1, our priorities are all wrong."
"Americans: things are expensive. 
Trump: hold my beer."
"Stop buying stuff yearly even though the market tells you too. Buy american or local anytime you can and you are better than most people in the US.

"I think everyone will just take on loans at decades high interest rates and rapidly start business to fulfill missing gaps, working for $5/h to keep price low"
"This all assumes corporations would act in good faith instead of going to other countries, putting the cost increase on consumers, or using work arounds to not pay the tariffs… But they NEVER will because they’re psychopathic monsters of greed… This video trying to be impartial is even acting on bad faith, even humoring like corporations won’t take advantage of everyone to make just a dollar more profit… ️"
you speak fast and swallow some words. hard to follow without subtitles
Everyone is an economist in the comments 
I think  president should complete a 1 year economic certification before Running
Worked? The Gilded Age is hated.
"The US has been on a slow march towards deglobalization for a long time. Or perhaps more clearly stated, the US has been pushing towards self-sufficient production, and keeping as much as possible to be an exporter. Food, energy, military, and tech has been the focus since the 90s. And now the focus is moving towards manufacturing.
And this isn't something new. It started with the new nafta treaties in 2018, trying to move manufacturing ""close to home"" even if ""at home"" didn't seem practical... But manufacturing didn't move much, as it was still cheaper to manufacture in Asia, and import to the US directly. It wasn't until the first set of terrifs and the pandemic's interruption of supply chains that traction started happening. And then Biden doubled down on many of the same policies, and actually enforced the policies put forward by trump that ended up being easy to skirt around. And now trump seems to be tripping down on it all.

The things to watch that is taking people by surprise are
1) it is no longer just cheap Asian imports being targeted. The scope has broadened to practically all imported goods, even from allies and partner countries with long standing beneficial relationships. And nobody really saw that coming.
2) that the focus is no longer around bringing manufacturing purely to north America to keep prices low importing from Canada and Mexico which seemed to be the plan with Trump 1.0 and Biden. Now the rhetoric is that Canada and Mexico should seek statehood if they want nafta-like treatment... Which would make Republicans never re-electable ever again, which is why I think it is rhetorical and not an honest suggestion.

The thing is... This is already the direction things were moving. Just much more aggressively than anyone's wildest expectations. It takes time to build a manufacturing base, and it was actively being worked on, so the rush and change of the goal posts seem a little bit crazy.
I think the other effect is just how much this will cause disruptions to manufacturing and supply side inflation in the short run. As well as manufacturer side inflation building out the infrastructure and hiring needed to make this practical. Until the transition completes, we will likely see 5-10% inflation be normal before things settle down... And that could be a decade or two, which would be rough.
I suspect that the thinking is that we have the lead on AI and robotics, which will allow a sort of jobless manufacturing revolution. If that proves out, then inflation effects could be greatly minimized by the deflationary effects of automation... But as someone to follows those fields quite a bit, I don't think we are there yet at a practical level. Great strides have been made, and it is coming in the next decade... But pushing this hard this fast is taking too much AI PR hype at face value and not understanding how immature the tech is right now. It will get there... But still 3-5 years before any real reliable deployment is ready with expected costs and procedures that can last more than a couple years before being redone. And doing double-work at that scale is expensive and inflationary, not cost savings and deflationary like tech often is.

Next 4 years are going to be weird... I don't know. The world lost its mind, and we are all turning into Russia now. And I'm pretty sure that Russia is the first to say that they don't want to be Russia, so I'm not sure what the game plan and motive is. "
This is just blatant low IQ slop. The national benefit of protecting and fostering domestic manufacturing is leagues more important than relative price hikes.
Did Elon Musk just abandon Doge coin and make his own XAI308K coin? WOW this guys a genius lol
There are way to many ads on you tube...
We have no other choice. Withiut tariffs nothing will change
"The problem is there isn’t current movement back to the US besides the fear of the tariffs.
There is no reason to move to the US where the regulation on your business is so much higher.
China has us beat at grunt labor. I don’t think we can beat their sweatshop wages.
The idea was americans would get smarter and we would just do all the innovating and let the other countries do the work; however, a lot of dumb people here still need careers and so we need a certain amount of industry.
We only need a bit more and i believe our problems could be solved by by cutting regulations not by blanket tariffs.
I believe we actually don’t want to be the industrial powerhouse when we are and could remain the innovation powerhouse.
There are many other problems trump should focus on before this."
"Now that Trump has signed in his tariffs, this video needs an update."
Short answer: No. Long Answer: Noooooooo.
7:54 *compensation of additional employment
"The Billionaires will get a windfall as they increase prices 20% or more.
This will take America into a depression deeper than they caused last time they did this."
"Do Americans really want to be taking factory jobs off the Chinese, though? Given the increasing risk of automation in many of these jobs (which is only amplified in higher wage countries), this just seems like going backwards..."
Even if useful... a sudden shock instead of gradually.. will not have the desired effect.
Last Trump term . . . When did a 20% tariff on imported steel . . . Domestic steel producers raised prices by 20% to match.  Domestic production learns profits come from federal government intervention . . . Not in innovation and efficiency and quality and customer care.
good video
No mention of time frame. 2 or 3 years is all that is needed till the next election.
"I know they can target individual products. But can they target individual states and even individual companies? If so, impose heavy tariffs only on those products from deeply red states!"
"Written by someone who clearly only thinks short term and is unable to fully comprehend the entirety of the tarrif system.
I would like anyone who thinks a tarrif based system cannot work to do something.  Go look at your last pay stub.  Look at exactly how much you lose to taxes and figure out exactly how much you would gain in a year if you didn't have to pay it.  Then add on your fees, if any, to file those taxes.
Now, with this number in mind, would you have more or less money per year if the prices of every day goods rose by 10%, which would be more than expected?
For most Americans, that is going to be a massive increase in savings, if they manage it properly.  After a few years, the market will adjust, raising employment costs or lowering everything from employment costs and prices.  In the end, when you see a job advertising XX per year, that is actually what it pays instead of half that.  People will be more capable of living within their means instead of relying on credit.
Tarrifs simplify so much if it were to replace income tax.  The world is complicated enough and moving so fast that most cannot keep up, even if they won't admit it.  Tarrifs will help overall.  The only people it would actually hurt are the super wealthy, which doesn't actually hurt them, or those who are unwilling to manage money properly, which they do to themselves."
In short tariff is a in direct tax increase which benefits government 10/10 times and maybe consumers 1/10 times 
I would be ok with tariffs if it can replace govt income and end income tax.
They did.
"Just look at the last tariffs Trump started. Solar panel production has not returned. Metal tariffs did curtail chinese steel dumping that did drive china to more easily close some over production. However alu production did not return and did more plants get built in the US when china holds much of the raw material supply. Trump has tariffed  everything, low value stuff as well as high value items that just might have been brought back"
"They voted for Trump because they were mad about high prices… So he goes and does something that all but guarantees prices will get even higher, and they cheer him on. Make it make sense ️"
They already did!
There weren't Automotive layoffs anywhere in 2018. Maybe in Australia but not in the US.
"The only wsy for any government to support its people is to be frugal in its spending. With the US havung $35T debt, I would say it is too lste"
25% is nothing. you guys need 600% tarrifs to be competitive again
Alexander Hamilton of Broadway fame... really? 
"I understand that this video is not entirely about this but is it at all possible that if trump were to put tarrifs on all imported goods and do away with income tax entirely that the two could cancel each other out? The individual products you purchase would cost more but you would be saving a lot of money by not having to pay income tax. As for a business owners perspective, I actually own a small construction company and pay around 30% on income tax, If I have to pay 25% more on materials but not pay income taxes I'm still up 5% on my net profit. I completely understand that a nations economy is a fickle thing and every change in policy can have unexpected results, but I believe that if it were done carefully, it could be done. I realize that there are and always will be companies that will use any chance they get to, lets be honest price gouge, but my customers can only afford to pay me so much for my services. So at least for myself in the above scenario I would lower my labor rate and pass the increased cost of goods onto the customer saving us both a little money and being able to outbid my more greedy compition on contracts. As for my now untaxed pay check, the amount would be a little higher, but all products would cost more, however I would essentially be ""paying taxes"" on only the products and services I actually use, making it easier to save money in the long run right?"

At least normal american can change from saying “they need to work two jobs to live” to “they need to work three to four jobs to live”.

How is tariff s eethnicnationalism??
Short answer”NO” the usa gov got too big. Maybe a mix
The answer is no and here’s why. Trump is not bases on some thing from the past. He also does not care about any economic problems they’re facing the general population he only cares about his rich buddies. That’s the truth until everyone realizes that they will continue this pointless arguing.
Do people really not when they raise the minimum wage everything goes up just to balance out
"Tariff's will not work, American labor is too expensive, the cost of living is too high for Americans to accept low paying jobs (especially if he guts all social safety nets), it also takes years to close and build new factories and then they would have to find a US source for certain materials which the US may not even have"

Now with lower revenue for the Mexican Gov't, if it hits them hard enough, they'll end up coming to the negotiating table. Case in point, look at Canada's currency since Trump imposed tariffs.

"Hey, you promised the chicken tariff. Guess you missed it."
Lets just say it.  Tariffs are a priori destructive.  No cases exist where they are economically beneficial because they eliminate competition and force consumers to buy goods they didnt want to voluntarily buy in the first place.  Tariffs raise prices and lower quality simultaneously while also picking individual winner and loser goods in the market.  Its honestly hard to think of a tax method that is more destructive and distorts the market forces more unfairly than tariffs.

"Brazilian here: tariffs don't work, all they do is make the domestic industry behind in relation to other countries in the world, because without external competition and with protectionism industries produce worse and more expensive products for consumers, not to mention the corruption generated in the bureaucratic import process and greater state intervention in the economy which leads to economic estagnation. ask me how I know this."
Yes
"No, in this case they won't work."
Like actually funding schools properly and introducing universal healthcare would do a lot more good.
"i look at it like this...we spend less...economy slows down...thx Trump.  I looked at some goods we use where prices have doubled in the last 8 years...has our pay doubled?  no... this will make it even worse.  maybe save a few bucks from lower taxes but then prices you have to spend even more than you save...not going to work.  if Trump sees this as us forcing us to make more goods here etc. sure, but guess what.  the cost here is a lot more than 10% or 25% so these tariffs just increase prices and do little to increase production in the USA."
"Think the point is that the American Economy is strong enough to handle price increases right now if it means that geo-political missions are accomplished. China, Mexico and Canada can only hold on for so long without American's buying their exports. At some point they'll have to cave and give in to what the Americans want. Which I believe is for those countries to do a better job of policing their borders and drug traffickers. In my opinion, it's worth it."
Ironic that trump maga hats are going to be more expensive..

"Key takeaways:
1. Tariffs are paid by the importer and passed on to the consumer, but Trump has convinced MAGA that Mexico and China will pay for the tariffs.
2. Even if inflation worsens, MAGA will blame Democrats instead of looking into the mirror.
3. Expect dramatic increases in export from countries like Vietnam due to Chinese exports flowing through there.
4. Tariffs won't create factories in America out of thin air, the most likely outcome is importing everything from the next cheapest country. 
5. Even with tariffs in place, most goods made in Mexico and China will still be way cheaper than those made in the U.S"

"Its just possible the blanket ban shoes trump which tariffs to drop later. What price increases vs domestic manufacting at home hits his voters the most. What gets reported on fox news and can producers and retailers just say its tariffs without tariffs ever having that impact on them like the dryers.
In an ideal plan, you'd tariff high value imports like cars in mexico and Canada or expensive electronics (robots, precision engineering, dumped goods looking for any market sales even at a loss). He'd tariff chips but he need Taiwan and the chip act needs time and the intel saga to work out. 
The good news is that all those markets taiffed will look to export away from the US"

Trump needs to raise tax's on American workers to offset the renewing of the Corporate tax cut. So he cant raise income tax's so this is the 3 card trick. He is a con man always has been. This will cost American households about $2600 per year.

"If you do the math, 1800 jobs at 815k per job, that's 1.467 billion. Pretty darn close to the 1.5 billion. Also you have to account for the dryers cost being raised as well as the taxed washing machine. Which is a relatively unique example of price increases, that inflates that 1.5 billion. Also in your example of steel, why didn't the domestic industries like auto, just buy domestic made steel? At 9:12  shouldn't that mean more domestic steel companies start popping up to meet the demand? I'm not quite convinced by this evidence you presented."

"I'm in support of tariffs worldwide because we need to grow more localized industry (both for the purpose of wealth equality and climate reasons) but ironically they simply wont work in any positive manner unless you were to implement so called 'socialist' policies like taxing the 1% more (which solved the great depression) and dismantling the financial sector along with the myth of infinite growth. 

Otherwise countries like america are simply hastening their current path to mimic china more closely with a few ultra wealthy families paying slave wages to workers in unsafe conditions and hoarding the generated wealth to themselves (which is already their current situation, just not as extreme yet). Funnily enough Trump even wants to reintroduce children to factory work, just like china."

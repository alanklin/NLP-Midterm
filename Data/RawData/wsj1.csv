President Donald Trump often cites the 25th President, William McKinley, as an inspiration for tariffs. The ‘McKinley Tariffs’ were some of the largest hikes in U.S. history, but in his second term, McKinley changed his mind, and argued for more free international trade as a way of helping the U.S. economy. …

Trump likes to say that tariffs won't raise prices, but the whole purpose of tariffs is to raise prices, so people won't buy cheap foreign goods, but more expensive American goods that are only cheaper than the foreign goods because of the tariffs. He says that foreign companies will lower their prices, so tariffs won't actually make foreign goods more expensive, which means that the tariffs won't help American companies make more money by being cheaper than the foreign goods. He is actually saying that he is doing it for the tax revenue and not to help American companies increase their sales. 

On the other hand, tariffs other countries put on American products will mean lost sales for American companies or they will have to lower their prices too to counter-act the tariffs. Either way, they lose money.

Note they didn't do anything in this piece to show the link that can come from tariff and income inequality  -  by he late 19th C tariffs led america into the Gilded age - super rich oligarchs who BOUGHT American civil society - they owned the banks, the media, the politicians, and levers of regulation - and was one of the greatest periods of income inequality in the US (and the world). America started to wean themselves off Tarriffs as they had saturated their on markets - when America reached for Tariffs again in 1930 with the economic downturn, it crashed the economy and led to the great depression.

No, President William McKinley did not abandon his tariff policy. He was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. As a Congressman, he was responsible for the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect American industries. Later, as president, he signed the Dingley Tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in U.S. history until the 1930s.

However, McKinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. He began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. This was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage U.S. exports.

Why Was McKinley Assassinated?
McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. Czolgosz believed that McKinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. Inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the Pan-American Exposition. The president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on September 14, 1901. His assassination led to Theodore Roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the Progressive Era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy.

While I liked the insight and history of McKinley's presidency and tariff policy, this video omits that the America that President Trump resides over is not even remotely the same type of economy as it was back then. And the video skips the nuances of the differences between how his policies would actually impact the three R's (Revenue, Restriction/Protectionism, and Reciprocity) versus how McKinley used them in the 19th century. Also the government revenue chart is misleading, because both Income Tax and Tariffs primarily are paid by Americans, not foreigners. And it just affects Americans at different rates. Income Tax is more progressive (affecting wealthier people more (allegedly), whereas Tariffs are more regressive (affecting poorer people more).

Global manufacturing wasn't as specialized or technical as it is today. Moving a wool mill or tin smelting is very different than moving auto or computer chip or even labor-intensive tasks like clothing that favor low wage countries.  You improve domestic manufacturing through investment, building modern automated factors that require little or no labor inputs and thus can compete with the global price against the developing nations. Tariffs doesn't create this investment, tax breaks or even stimulus does.

Actually, the three Rs fit into Trump's methodology just fine.  He'll pursue revenue on Monday, restriction on Tuesday, reciprocity on Wednesday, and then on Thursday he'll deny any of it ever happened and call it a plot against him.  We went through this for four years.  It's utterly predictable.

As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run.

It's ironic that the 1 policy Trump has been the most consistent on even decades before he became a politician is believing that tariffs are always good for U.S. businesses. Then again, he failed/bankrupted multiple businesses before becoming a politician, so it's not too surprising he stands by enacting tariffs regardless of what economists say. Tariffs can work effectively if used sparingly/selectively, but when you put broad tariffs on all goods from a specific or even multiple countries it makes foreign made goods more expensive, as well as U.S. made goods that include foreign produced parts.

William McKinley, the 25th president of the United States, was shot on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York, on September 6, 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley died on September 14 of gangrene caused by the wounds.

I have an idea.  Once all of the debt is paid off, why not gift Americans with grants, such as education and starting businesses.  More so than what is being done today.  Plus the extra money can go toward helping veterans, the homeless, the sick and so on.  Helping save our wildlife is also important.

There was no leverage in tarrifs in the 19 century because we did not have a trade deficit.

The two problems here that Trump is neglecting is that three presidents who were involved either with divisive tariffs or social upheaval that lead to either civil war or social unrest in America died in office: Lincoln, McKinley and Kennedy.

I get the point about McKinley saying at that time tariffs weren’t the answer and now the most was global cooperation and they were no longer necessary because we had a large surplus. What everyone is failing to recognize is that we aren’t in those times now we have a massive deficit and we gave up too many important sectors of us manufacturing. Trump just wants to bring that back as well as use them as a threat to make country’s more malleable to his goals.

The tariffs also only worked during a time period where we were mostly farmers. We were exporting much more than we were importing. That’s not our current system now (it’s the complete opposite), so if he were to impose a bunch of tariffs on the imports it would dramatically hurt us. 
Why doesn’t he focus on bringing back jobs and focus on that first? He’s trying to jump the gun and he’s missing a crucial step!

I think that this media piece is saying is that tariffs can be used to achieve specific limited goals.  However, they are a Tax on the average consumer.  Also, one must consider the negative effects on other related industries.
   I think that the way to best use them in this day and age to increase the federal inflow (or decrease the deficit), is to combine them with automating (& increasing the use of AI) the federal government as much as can be and increase the tax (significantly ) on those billionaires who benefitted the most from the new technology they created.  These billionaires will continue to get rich, just at a much slower rate,

The Wall Street Journal’s dismissal of Trump’s tariffs as “the dumbest trade war” ignores their strategic leverage in reshaping North American trade and security. Far from reckless protectionism, the policy has already pressured Mexico to deploy troops against fentanyl trafficking and incentivized trade shifts that align with U.S. interests. These tariffs are not just economic penalties but a calculated effort to force concessions on critical issues like immigration, drug enforcement, and manufacturing imbalances.

Beyond diplomacy, tariffs serve a broader goal—reducing U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains and reviving domestic industries. With 42% of auto parts sourced from Mexico, targeted tariffs encourage reshoring, strengthening states like Michigan and Ohio. Selective rates, such as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy versus 25% on other goods, further reveal a nuanced strategy protecting key sectors without fully severing trade ties. This push for economic sovereignty is a response to vulnerabilities exposed by global crises, ensuring long-term resilience over short-term economic discomfort.

Critics who champion free trade often ignore its failures, from stagnant wages to the U.S.’s $180 billion trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. Just as Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs led to USMCA negotiations that strengthened labor protections, these tariffs could force necessary reforms. Markets, too, have proven adaptable, with initial stock market dips stabilizing as businesses adjust.

Labeling this strategy as simply “dumb” oversimplifies a complex, high-stakes negotiation. The real question isn’t whether tariffs cause disruption—they always do—but whether that disruption secures lasting economic and security advantages. If it does, then the short-term pain is a price worth paying.

In fact Roosevelt continued on with Mckinley's Tariffs and was a big supporter of Tariffs and he ended up on Mount Rushmore. A tariff is a tax and a tax is a tariff and the both start with TA and are one in the same in raising money for governments. People say tariffs or should I say taxes used to only work 200 years ago, but not now, so in essence then  taxes which are tariffs worked then, but not now, but this is BS.. It's rich that Democrats are complaining about Tariffs now, since they support high taxes, or should I say high tariffs on business which then passes the cost down to the consumers who they claim to care so much about, but this BS too.

On a popular radio talk show they said we needed to have an income tax back in 1913 because tariffs didn't provide enough revenue. they also said that tariffs only brought in 10% while DUTIES on tobacco and alcohol provided the rest. So, here we go again with the word duties, just another word that means the same thing as a tax or a tariff with the same intent, raising money for the government. How about we change income tax to income tariff or WAIT, income duties. I suggest we choose one of these words and drop the other two, so we can all be on the same page., especially those of you who say tarff's only worked then, but not now, just a play on words.

Tariffs are a tactical approach, not an overarching strategy. That is why during his first Presidency from 2018 through 2020 the trade war with China was a fiesta-del-failure for the United States which hurt the Supply Chain. The damage was only worsened by the Pandemic in 2020 which aggravated the availability of certain goods and catalyzed the increase in prices. I can understand the goals of the tariffs, but, without a strategic backbone, this can only be another foreign policy failure that will hurt common folk in the long run. And like explained in this video, you cannot achieve ALL goals concurrently.

There are more principles, of course; to include exchange rates, national fuel needs, supply chains, commodities based on dollars, what have you.

In france the gouvernement knew that computers are important and put so much money in it. Do you know any computer components which come from france? No? I dont eighter... China pushs some industries with tax money to make them competitiors world wide. Now our industries have to battle product cost which cant be fight with because they have no communist state putting all the money in. So how can we compete?

How can a revenue SURPLUS be such a problem? I don't get it. This video describes it as if it's such an undesirable 'problem'. If the govt has a SURPLUS of money, isn't it a BOON? It means that the government can invest in other things, like infrastructure, or improving social services, or cutting taxes. How on earth can the WSJ describe this as a 'problem'?

Poor Trump, his lack of Education has made his brain slow and unusable. I don't know who is writing his papers but I think, it might be him.  3 years and 10 months and the States can go back to normal. I will save a lot of money these next three years because  plan to keep all my money in my pocket and also, lose a lot of weight. No spending for me and no toys next three christmasses. I did the same thing during Trumps last term. :) Good luck America. Keep your money in your pocket.!

Well now we know where Trump gets his idea.  Again, the intelligence of a 3-year old.  Takes an idea and runs with it without thinking it through.  Its a different era now.  Completely different!  And as the economist analysts are saying, you can not have all three benefits at the same time.  Also couldn't help wonder if the same fate will befall Trump that happened to his hero.  At the rate things are going at this moment, could well happen.  Time will only tell.

Both China and Japan are guilty of putting restrictions on the selling of goods in their domestic markets, but happily exporting goods to the West, for example cars. 
This is unfair, therefore selective tariffs could be used to encourage certain markets to open up. However scattergun tariffs, by a man with an ego, that dwarfs his intellect, are not a great idea.
The biggest issue for the USA / Europe is an issue of competitiveness, can we offer enticing, high quality products at a competitive price point? When it comes to EVs, even with subsidies to lower prices, the Western products are not clearly superior to Chinese versions, especially when it comes to tailoring to the tastes of the local culture.

Trump is right that tariffs would bring back manufacturing in the US and bring more fiscal revenues directly and indirectly thru more jobs paying income taxes. But where, IMHO he is wrong is to tariff Canada because the US needs Cdn natural resources in order to support their manufacturing industry and keep prices low. Tariffing Canada would push Canada to look for international markets et diversify away from the US. However, tariffing Mexico is understandable because Mexico’s links with China will create havoc in the US.

Something must be done and Trump/Musk are business people.Government spending is taxation whether directly thru taxation or indirectly thru inflation, the hidden tax with money we do not have.  Non asset owners are really hurt by inflation especially last 4 years of spending money out of thin air.  GDP reflects government spending whether borrowed dollars or real money.  One reason USA GDP is ok but Americans feel poor last 4 years. Yes, inflation is doling but that means prices not rising as fast

"Trump pauses tariffs on Mexico, Canada for a month, but his threats spooked almost everyone: https://on.wsj.com/40NbqLQ"
"Tariffs on steel in his first term: 
- created 1000 jobs in steel 
- destroyed 75000 jobs in automotive - because of expensive steel"
"I trust economists over Trump. If economists are saying tariffs are bad at the end, I will take it."
Did McKiinley .... sell made in china bibles ?
I’m a US semiconductor worker. Our company is so globally intertwined it’s insane. It’s been that way for long long long time.
"Protectionism needs an industry to protect. Without an industry to protect, Trump's tariffs just interrupted the supply chain for no purpose."
This is why Musk needs to purge the so-called experts out of the federal govt.  We can't have people like historians bringing up facts.
"Please be aware, that the revenue from tariffs is not coming from abroad, it is from the American people! It is in fact a penalty Americans pay to Trump for trying to use goods that were cheaper."
Tariffs worked 200 yrs ago when USAs economy was way smaller... High Tariffs doesn't work now
No country has achieved significant economic development through protectionism policies.
Can somebody call the white house and let them know its 2025 and not 1896. Please & thx
I always wondered which era MAGA meant….
Trump is the Dunning-Kruger Effect personified
At this point hes just manipulating the stock market. He never planned to implement tariffs today. He wanted to announce it and then postpone them just before they appear. Watch him either implement the tariffs in a month and cancel them after or postpone them again.
This man is going to tear apart the world
 21st century president is trying to copy the idea of a 19th century leader! I see.
Vast wealth for the rich not the common man
"I can bet you a million yes million that some or the other intern went on chatgpt and searched. ""Tell me which US president was the best advocate of Tariffs and his name"" and chatgpt replied with Mckenly and they went on with it. Thats the only thing he knows about him. His name. Thats it."
The $64 dollar question here is ....American industry today.  Is the worker of today capable of the success in this economy as in was in McKinley's time ? Bring industry back ? Great ...but who is going to work ? We aren't making products from tin plate anymore.  Would expect that $64 was worth a lot more then too.
If Trump doesn't read; who is telling him about President McKinley?
"It's amazing how Trump or his advisers look backwards for ideas.

Then fail to research what went wrong with past ideas. 

As always this is about assigning blame, keep visible on the news and in social media."
"All the ‘smart money men’ on Wall Street are shocked at the stupidity of Trump’s tariffs. He said he’d do it - he wants to do it , he’s a moron and they said and did nothing."
"When the Wall Street calls out Trump's  tariffs as ""The dumbest trade war in history"" I would listen to them rather than Trump's lies."
"Trump likes to say that tariffs won't raise prices, but the whole purpose of tariffs is to raise prices, so people won't buy cheap foreign goods, but more expensive American goods that are only cheaper than the foreign goods because of the tariffs. He says that foreign companies will lower their prices, so tariffs won't actually make foreign goods more expensive, which means that the tariffs won't help American companies make more money by being cheaper than the foreign goods. He is actually saying that he is doing it for the tax revenue and not to help American companies increase their sales. 

On the other hand, tariffs other countries put on American products will mean lost sales for American companies or they will have to lower their prices too to counter-act the tariffs. Either way, they lose money."
"Note they didn't do anything in this piece to show the link that can come from tariff and income inequality  -  by he late 19th C tariffs led america into the Gilded age - super rich oligarchs who BOUGHT American civil society - they owned the banks, the media, the politicians, and levers of regulation - and was one of the greatest periods of income inequality in the US (and the world). America started to wean themselves off Tarriffs as they had saturated their on markets - when America reached for Tariffs again in 1930 with the economic downturn, it crashed the economy and led to the great depression."
We all know what ended up happening to William McKinley.
"No, President William McKinley did not abandon his tariff policy. He was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. As a Congressman, he was responsible for the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect American industries. Later, as president, he signed the Dingley Tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in U.S. history until the 1930s.

However, McKinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. He began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. This was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage U.S. exports.

Why Was McKinley Assassinated?
McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. Czolgosz believed that McKinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. Inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the Pan-American Exposition. The president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on September 14, 1901. His assassination led to Theodore Roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the Progressive Era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy."
"Tariffs can help some domestic industries, that is true, but they hurt other industries and the consumer at least as much. They are perfect for protecting inefficient companies and unions."
Fascinating segment! Difficult to conceive of a universe where a surplus was a problem. Might have to pick up that guy's book. Good work WSJ!
Thanks WSJ for exposing the weaknesses.
Running the government like a business shouldn’t be the goal. The government is for the benefit of the people and to provide services
Everyone's an expert. This is great! 
This explains why his day 1 executive order was to rename Denali to Mount McKinley... I just assumed it was to erase the native name. Turned out it was based more on idiotic idolatry.
"More than just tariffs, William McKinley versaw a period of American expansionism, including the annexations of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and Hawaii. Trump is indeed inspired by him."
"If you're going to re-introduce tatiffs, lower the income tax."
"A small amount of knowledge is a dangerous thing, reading about climbing Mt Everest isn’t the same as climbing it. Reading about McKinley doesn’t mean you can implement his policies……that little knowledge thing in real time "
This WILL HURT the American people / our economy
"Well done, great informative video"
this guy is a laughting stock for the whole world and the smart americans. You get what you vote.
"Ok, WSJ, some of us(including you) may hate Trump's Tariffs... but the reality is Mckinley never abandoned tariffs, he just adopted reciprocity agreements in his second term - which is what Trump is doing. Mckinley allowed for reduced tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. However, this was not an abandonment of tariffs but an adjustment to improve trade relations while maintaining protectionism. He sadly got assassinated in 1901. Let's not twist history."
Wow! Trump says William McKinley as often as he said Hanable Lector
These tariffs won’t actually do nearly as much good as it will do bad and it’s just gonna be so sad that most people are gonna struggle even more over the next 4 years to afford basic goods.
Who are the lawyers advising Trump on legal matters?
"3:17 ain't none a yas talkin about McKinley's pose in that photo, it's like ""hey there..."""
"While I liked the insight and history of McKinley's presidency and tariff policy, this video omits that the America that President Trump resides over is not even remotely the same type of economy as it was back then. And the video skips the nuances of the differences between how his policies would actually impact the three R's (Revenue, Restriction/Protectionism, and Reciprocity) versus how McKinley used them in the 19th century. Also the government revenue chart is misleading, because both Income Tax and Tariffs primarily are paid by Americans, not foreigners. And it just affects Americans at different rates. Income Tax is more progressive (affecting wealthier people more (allegedly), whereas Tariffs are more regressive (affecting poorer people more)."
Is this the WatchMojo lady?
"At least McKinley had the smarts to realise when he was wrong.

This guy? Keep dreaming."
If we keep JPow in charge of the fed long enough we'll have to start printing the $500 bill again.  That'll get William McKinley some overdue recognition.
Very well explained . Good job giving the pros and cons of all options
"Feels like Trump fell asleep watching only a quarter of some McKinley documentary, and nobody told him what happened to the rest of it."
"Remember.Once prices go up, they never come back down."
Good video.
"Global manufacturing wasn't as specialized or technical as it is today. Moving a wool mill or tin smelting is very different than moving auto or computer chip or even labor-intensive tasks like clothing that favor low wage countries.  You improve domestic manufacturing through investment, building modern automated factors that require little or no labor inputs and thus can compete with the global price against the developing nations. Tariffs doesn't create this investment, tax breaks or even stimulus does."
"Actually, the three Rs fit into Trump's methodology just fine.  He'll pursue revenue on Monday, restriction on Tuesday, reciprocity on Wednesday, and then on Thursday he'll deny any of it ever happened and call it a plot against him.  We went through this for four years.  It's utterly predictable."
"This a not the 1890's . Economies are completely different, intertwined and dependant on each other, which has built wealth for many nations. Why Trump thinks they work now is beyond the rational of economists and even the WSJ."
"trump's goal is to bring the USA back to being isolationism, not to have an endgame goal, if we become isolationists again in 2025, we'll fall as an empire"
What if trump’s presidency ends in the same way McKinley’s did? 
A man who takes the lessons of history to a whole new level...
He sure is a fool
The law of self preservation is not the highest but the lowest law of nature
"This is quite simple, forget the USA"
"I think it’s funny all the new economists in the country.  I will tell you a secret, trump is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers!!!"
"As an European in a true developed country - not like America, I’m very happy Trump won. We needed the international laughing stock back to entertain us. It started very well during the elections with “they are eating the dogs”. 

Thanks America for this gift to the world."
"Maybe McKinley isn't the best president for Trump to idolize, all thing considered."
"This is a great summation of everyone’s thoughts on tariffs. Sounds great in practice and then eventually you realize it’s not worth it and kind of dumb. 

I posted something on this exact thing and the rest of trump’s economic policies."
"As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run."
"It's ironic that the 1 policy Trump has been the most consistent on even decades before he became a politician is believing that tariffs are always good for U.S. businesses. Then again, he failed/bankrupted multiple businesses before becoming a politician, so it's not too surprising he stands by enacting tariffs regardless of what economists say. Tariffs can work effectively if used sparingly/selectively, but when you put broad tariffs on all goods from a specific or even multiple countries it makes foreign made goods more expensive, as well as U.S. made goods that include foreign produced parts."
"tariff to bring in manufacture to the country = Yes if its 3rd world country with cheap labor , for the most expensive country in the world? Nahh, they rather pay the tariff instead moving that cost alot of money , not including the labor cost."
McKinley tariff solved the problem of government having too much money.  Today’s government has huge debts.  McKinley tariff works when there was no income tax.
Why the f is the football World Cup in that disgraceful country/office...
The Wall Street Journal Trump supporter. Now are repenting their support of the Mad King.
"Following McKinley, but which version will Trump choose – hike or cut?"
What about the tariffs during the 1930's...?
"Tariffs in and of themselves are awful. Free markets are undefeated. But if tariffs can be threatened to get what he wants that’s a plus for the country, it’s not all that bad."
"When tariffs begin to tank the stock market and the economy, expect to cop out: ""Nobody knew that economics were so difficult""."
"Protectionism was a way to shelter industry from foreign competition. Once industry was large enough and could compete globally, they were abandoned. But what does Trump hope for? That America will compete with China on manufactured goods? Or Canada with oil?"
Free Trade is one of the key principles of economic prosperity
"Americans are so polarized. When they’re good, they’re really good. And then the unhinged"
"Too much money,is a bad thing..."
Bring back not just manufacturing but also services and aerospace maintenance from overseas
"Up til 1913 USA government ran on tariff taxes until income tax started 1913 as government needed even more money.  Tariffs under Trump bringing nations to the bargaining table as global trade needs fixing.  With any trade, union, country negotiations things must be worked out with both sides typically not receiving everything they wanted."
"The disadvantages of tariffs is pretty straightforward. The whole point is it would hurt the other countries more, and the current admin knows it. It was always a bargaining strategy from the beginning, and it's working. Got to give the admin that whether you agree with everything or not."
There was no China and Deepseek... at that time.
"This was fun, funny and informative to watch. Reminds me of Vox."
Smart job. Someone forgot to inform the WSJ it’s 2025 and not 1890. The world and global trade has drastically changed over a century ago.
"Late 19th century. The era of tariffs, non consecutive presidents and something else… how did McKinley’s term as president end?"
"I can't take Trumpski seriously.
He's such a Clown .
But very entertaining "
"As a note: that anarchist was an unjustly sacked postal worker.
Food for thought"
Tariff king Trump
Super interesting
"If these guys know so much more……how did they get us into such a terrible situation? 
Time will show who is right, but liberals wont abandon their delusions regardless."
Mexico and Canada gave nothing and he folded.
"""Abandoning"" is quite the spin. Some solutions are meant to be temporary. Some might prefer the term ""transitory."""
Just wanted to say I was expecting a bias report. Amazing end up knowledge-based fair reporting. I'll continue to watch thanks for the cool content
"This our opportunity to reintroduce slave labor as an economic tool! Rather than buying all of our goods from countries that rely on slave labor, we should just let a bunch of people in the country that are willing to work for pennies on the dollar!"
“Our country had more money than it knew what to do with”… Then you added almost 9 Trillion to our deficit!! A record he set that he doesn’t seem to want to brag about. 
"Interesting twist, McKinley abandoned his own policy! "
Tariffs are a bargaining tool. All other trading countries use them against us all the time. We have a massive trade deficit.
The orange man is a genius
There is no comparing the United States of today with yesteryear.  The Wall Street Journal should have taken that into consideration!
Weaponizing your currency and trade policies will distance countries from you
"They just worked. It worked this past weekend. Not to mention the other tarriffs that are still in place from his first term... 
The mental gymnsatics it takes for Democrats to cope is genuinely stunning"
"Trump would stand there and tell the guy who literally wrote the book on traffics, is wrong."
"William McKinley, the 25th president of the United States, was shot on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York, on September 6, 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley died on September 14 of gangrene caused by the wounds."
If Wall Street says it bad you know it’s good 
Mckinley knows. Trump Doesnt 
McKinley put tariffs on pots and pannes. Not on computers with complex supply chains
"I think it's worth noting how tiny the US GDP was in 1890-1900. That $8 million you see in the chart isn't a typo. Even adjusted for inflation, it's about 2% of what it is today."
McKinley: the bloodthirsty conqueror.
"I have an idea.  Once all of the debt is paid off, why not gift Americans with grants, such as education and starting businesses.  More so than what is being done today.  Plus the extra money can go toward helping veterans, the homeless, the sick and so on.  Helping save our wildlife is also important."
#XAI315K to the moooooooon! 
Trump blinked
Except the threats of tariffs are working exactly as planned
"Why are other countries not abandoning their high tariff policies against US made goods if tariffs causes ""depressions"" ? If that was the case, every country in the world would be in constant depressions based on WSJ 's thinking."
Very interesting video!
"working honestly and friendly can earn money.
working by oppressing and attacking other absolutely also can earn money.
but in the end oppressing other is only temporary, later on the ""other"" that being oppress will find alternative partner.
this is logic and no need rocket science."
What is the point of spending on non necessary objectives when you are in debt
The guy who wrote the book about tariff thinks he knows more about tariff than the one who actually implemented it like Trump? How silly he is...
Very good video
Remember we are still subsiding farmers from trumps last tariffs 
I rather have a surplus. With the surplus the government could use that surplus money to help the rest of the world as long as United states people are doing great. I do not see what the down size of being a surplus.
I trust trump and his meme coin….. 
A BA from Wharton is a polite way of saying you flunked out from the MBA program that your daddy donated $2 million.
"There was no leverage in tarrifs in the 19 century because we did not have a trade deficit.

Leverage goes to the buyer, not the seller.

Comparing Trump tarrifs to McKinley tarrifs makes no sense."
Well those taxes are definitely helping the poor and middle class said no one ever 
I love paying import tariffs and passing them on to the average consumer! (No we can't make stuff here overnight.)
This only happens if the tariffs give the government a surplus of cash. Have you seen our national debt?
"The two problems here that Trump is neglecting is that three presidents who were involved either with divisive tariffs or social upheaval that lead to either civil war or social unrest in America died in office: Lincoln, McKinley and Kennedy. He needs to be really careful. And I am not saying this to stir trouble. Trump is courting his own premature mortality."
I love the idea that the US government was in trouble from not being in enough debt
Tariffs = terrible tulips
I get the point about McKinley saying at that time tariffs weren’t the answer and now the most was global cooperation and they were no longer necessary because we had a large surplus. What everyone is failing to recognize is that we aren’t in those times now we have a massive deficit and we gave up too many important sectors of us manufacturing. Trump just wants to bring that back as well as use them as a threat to make country’s more malleable to his goals.
"He didn’t read the whole bio, just the foreword and no one made a movie"
"Tariffs are bad for GDP in the short term. Any comment that denounces tariffs is solely focused on GDP in the short term, not the relative wealth gained by the average American from tariffs in the longterm"
"Only person who said ""William McKinley"" more was Karl Rove proof reading the galleys"
Tariffs on daily goods=tax on the poor
That pumpkin spiced palpantine doesn’t understand economics god help us all lol
"Yeah, yeah, yeah..... How about reciprocation? How about tariffing those who tariff us?"
"Tariffs are a great way to raise revenue if most of your economy is powered by imports.  Trump is correct here.  Yes there will be short term disruption, but in the end it will be a steady stream of revenue for the US"
Theres like 0 advantage of Tariffs unless you can bargain stuff
You know it's crazy when Uncle Rupert uses his platforms to speak out against something Trump is doing
"If he, & President Musk keep it up, they're gonna get McKinleyed"
I question the sincerity of Wall Street Journal as over educated women and minorities instead of unbiased facts.
Isolationism while China is rapidly increasing global ties is idiotic
"The tariffs also only worked during a time period where we were mostly farmers. We were exporting much more than we were importing. That’s not our current system now (it’s the complete opposite), so if he were to impose a bunch of tariffs on the imports it would dramatically hurt us. 
Why doesn’t he focus on bringing back jobs and focus on that first? He’s trying to jump the gun and he’s missing a crucial step!"
"different time, different era."
"I think that this media piece is saying is that tariffs can be used to achieve specific limited goals.  However, they are a Tax on the average consumer.  Also, one must consider the negative effects on other related industries.
   I think that the way to best use them in this day and age to increase the federal inflow (or decrease the deficit), is to combine them with automating (& increasing the use of AI) the federal government as much as can be and increase the tax (significantly ) on those billionaires who benefitted the most from the new technology they created.  These billionaires will continue to get rich, just at a much slower rate,"
Tariffs are a tax on consumers.
Hoover signed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act that contributed to the Great Depression.
Protective Tariffs
I thought Herbert Hoover was the tariff king.
The best thing was that the GOP got clobbered at the mid-term elections following the recession caused by the tarrifs. If only Trump had gone to class at Penn.
Gotta love the reference to quack economist Art Laffer. Lol never change wsj
So basically it’s a giant tax. Not as complex as I thought going into this video
"ow if it was the Luxury Trap, and someone came and looked at Europe vs. the US, then no one would have a serious conversation with Europe, they would talk to the US and say that they spend a lot more money than they earn. Because that's where we are. It makes no economic sense."
"The Wall Street Journal’s dismissal of Trump’s tariffs as “the dumbest trade war” ignores their strategic leverage in reshaping North American trade and security. Far from reckless protectionism, the policy has already pressured Mexico to deploy troops against fentanyl trafficking and incentivized trade shifts that align with U.S. interests. These tariffs are not just economic penalties but a calculated effort to force concessions on critical issues like immigration, drug enforcement, and manufacturing imbalances.

Beyond diplomacy, tariffs serve a broader goal—reducing U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains and reviving domestic industries. With 42% of auto parts sourced from Mexico, targeted tariffs encourage reshoring, strengthening states like Michigan and Ohio. Selective rates, such as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy versus 25% on other goods, further reveal a nuanced strategy protecting key sectors without fully severing trade ties. This push for economic sovereignty is a response to vulnerabilities exposed by global crises, ensuring long-term resilience over short-term economic discomfort.

Critics who champion free trade often ignore its failures, from stagnant wages to the U.S.’s $180 billion trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. Just as Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs led to USMCA negotiations that strengthened labor protections, these tariffs could force necessary reforms. Markets, too, have proven adaptable, with initial stock market dips stabilizing as businesses adjust.

Labeling this strategy as simply “dumb” oversimplifies a complex, high-stakes negotiation. The real question isn’t whether tariffs cause disruption—they always do—but whether that disruption secures lasting economic and security advantages. If it does, then the short-term pain is a price worth paying."
Trump knows enough history to fill a thimble 
"In fact Roosevelt continued on with Mckinley's Tariffs and was a big supporter of Tariffs and he ended up on Mount Rushmore. A tariff is a tax and a tax is a tariff and the both start with TA and are one in the same in raising money for governments. People say tariffs or should I say taxes used to only work 200 years ago, but not now, so in essence then  taxes which are tariffs worked then, but not now, but this is BS.. It's rich that Democrats are complaining about Tariffs now, since they support high taxes, or should I say high tariffs on business which then passes the cost down to the consumers who they claim to care so much about, but this BS too."
"On a popular radio talk show they said we needed to have an income tax back in 1913 because tariffs didn't provide enough revenue. they also said that tariffs only brought in 10% while DUTIES on tobacco and alcohol provided the rest. So, here we go again with the word duties, just another word that means the same thing as a tax or a tariff with the same intent, raising money for the government. How about we change income tax to income tariff or WAIT, income duties. I suggest we choose one of these words and drop the other two, so we can all be on the same page., especially those of you who say tarff's only worked then, but not now, just a play on words."
"The graph is interesting. Those excise taxes are not nil, and the President’s home State of Florida uses them instead of income tax. The Hotel Tax has been very lucrative, albeit more erratic revenue than an income tax IMHO."
You're not really rich unless you can afford a legion.
and he wants US to produce like in the late 1800s and early 1900s? with such a high cost of working wage? the factories are not gonna go up and stay competitive.
"There's a scene about this in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"""
Hello people:  tariffs are TAXES!
Maybe now American manufacturing of tin plate can finally recover.
I'm curious how much has DT read about and talked with economists about tarrifs .... their pros and cons.
"If the Chinese are going to be paying for the tariffs, then stuff from Temu instead of being 80% off would have to be 90% off. Otherwise, Americans would have to buy the stuff for only 70% off."
Yeah apparently consumers suffer tariffs directly but you change your posture once we start talking about taxes. How about an episode on secretary mellon next time? We can then compare your logic in this video with the one on taxes
"tariffs will crush wall street before it crushes anybody else, good luck with that, big orange dude!"
So Trump is mackinley in reverse...
"It's actually shocking even now, how shallow Donald Trump's understanding of economics and history is."
"Tariffs are a tactical approach, not an overarching strategy. That is why during his first Presidency from 2018 through 2020 the trade war with China was a fiesta-del-failure for the United States which hurt the Supply Chain. The damage was only worsened by the Pandemic in 2020 which aggravated the availability of certain goods and catalyzed the increase in prices. I can understand the goals of the tariffs, but, without a strategic backbone, this can only be another foreign policy failure that will hurt common folk in the long run. And like explained in this video, you cannot achieve ALL goals concurrently."
"Insulate yourselves for the rough times ahead, my friends. It's gonna get worse before it gets worse."
He meant that him and his friends are going to be even richer.
"If tariffs will get US companies to build in the US vs other countries, I'm for it."
basically a TARIF(F)  is nothing else  than  a list of items and their prices .when you're  in a restaurant checking out the menu you're looking at a tarif  nothing to do  with  taxes         thanks 4 sharing
"If the government is running a surplus they couldn’t just loan money out to other countries, fund programs various social programs and invest in growing and current industries."
We should restart the whaling industry.
"If you call your self a conservative, you cannot believe in Tariffs. FREEE MARKET BABY WE LOVE A FREE MARKET."
"Obviously, Trump missed the point about McKinley’s untimely ending!"
It's pretty impressive how Trump got the GOP to adopt a massive tax hike.
"Yeah, you can’t copy William. You’ve got to be yourself, sorry Donald."
"Yeah the numbers don't make sense, there is not enough imports to tariff to even come close to income tax"
"You all are purposely missing the point, if Tariffs dont work then how come we are paying high tariffs while everyone else is paying low tariffs! We are paying 5-50% to mexico and sometimes 300% and lower to CANADA but Tariffs don't work according to your ""experts"" then why are we paying for them then? What your experts are really saying we want stuff valued cheap so we can get cheap labor and corporation wont be able to do that if we out Tariff them they will have to make there stuff here! There I fixed your argument! He is trying to get the economy to a point where we can drop income tax! But of course the WSJ wants everything to keep the same so they can continue to rob Americans blind and pay for cheap China labor!"
"In 2016 there were 120 000 employed in steel making. In 2025 its still 120 000. Tariffs did nothing.

. There are 1.5 million Americans employed by Walmart"
"Lol, so, the moral of the McKinley story is, if you're a president that goes hog wild on tariffs... "
Billions of dollars… your 36 trillion dollars in debt. You haven’t enough years to see your country out of debt
So clearly he’s used tariffs as a bargaining tool
"""Tariffs are going to make us very rich"". Yes, Donnie, Elon and oligarchs."
Why Wall Street journal is so biased against trump
I wonder who told him William McKinley was
4:57 You can still change course Elephant!
Got in early because XAI315K is already predicted to pass $2 by June.
"The traitor needs to be impeached, removed, imprisoned for life!"
Not a trade war but a drug war
"Consumers will pay the high prices, stay tuned they are coming up soon."
Tariffs because the only other way is to compete in a global market.... with Trump at the helm what could go wrong ???
Didn't McKinnley get assissinated?
Why not tariff Britain and France until they agree to service the trillion in loans that they haven’t paid a penny on since 1931?
Calm down and ride the wave Chicky
America is wealthy. Its the wealthiest country on the planet. It just chooses not to distribute its wealth among its people. Its not alone in having a huge wealth gap but becoming richer won't make most Americans better off if the uber rich won't share the bounty. In fact the regressive nature of tariffs is likely to widen the wealth gap.
tariffs are essentially a rug pull/ bait and switch
"Make the poor, poorer !!"
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't McKinley the President that got killed before Teddy Roosevelt?
Those tariffs where paid by who? 
One can dream Trump has the same ending
Such a clown 
"Watching this makes more sense now... However, I do not believe that tariffs on imports will generate sufficient revenue in the present. Can anybody tell if it will?"
"lolz, I love that Americans think there will be midterm elections."
"Honestly with all that chaos and instability created by Trump,
what reason would any business have to stay in the US not to mention to invest into it?"
"Well, nobody has ever accused Trump of being smart. Once again he displays incredibly low intelligence, revealing that he knows just as much about tariffs as he does history."
They took down a mckinley statue in the city i live in.
"At this point, he’s just creating so much volatility in the markets to make a profit either from shorting or going long, pays to be close to trump at this point"
Hopefully the tariffs are just a bargaining chip
I thought tariff rates didn’t fall until 1913?
It wasn't the same era.
Trump best not go to Buffalo then
He was also shot at point blank range by a guy who thought he was told to do so soooo ️
Tariffs will be Axe on foot by Gringos 
"Awww, poor WSJ, things aren't going your way, are they?"
What was the problem with  having government surplus in those days prior to income tax?
Surplus? Don't know what to do with it? How bout giving the money back to it's citizens. And if the country is getting richer than the citizens should too. Non different than those Arab countries that are crazy rich. All their citizens are taken care of. Wild.
What will Amazon or Wallmart sell then?
We are hoping Trump has the same fate as Mackinley did during his second term and can come around on Tariffs
Trump folded like his casinos
I wonder if trump will go the same way as McKinley
It will only slow down the economy of US
tariff king sounds like train wreck.
It was the 1890 midterms not 1892
How many horses during mckinley years that made familys  poorer and did the hay come from different countries? It was a different time
Whatever happened to McKinley anyway?
McKinley was also America's great imperialist president.
"We get it, WSJ. You’re against Trump. Hey, how about you talk about trade deficits? Did this guy say excess money “just sits in government safes”??? Must be an “academic economist”. That’s NOT how it works at all. Might want to interview another “economist” in future stories. Maybe this is the journalist’s old college professor."
What a joke
So in other words the tariffs worked. And by the way... his anti tariff speech was the day before his assassination
What’s next a return to whale oil lamps and transatlantic zeppelin flights?
We cant continue to do the same thing like what we were doing....we had to change we keep raising a  higher gdp to debt ratio....we had to experiment and try something else. The biggest problem is we are the consumers of the world....the world needs us otherwise without us the whole world would go bankrupt. Trump knows this and understands this very very very well.
I feel sick when ever I hear his voice
5:55 after he accomplished what he wanted he changed tactics..nice
Well @ 30 trillion in debt id say we don't have to worry about a surplus any time soon. So maybe surplus era methods like excise and predominant income tax revenue is no longer feasible in our modern time
"The first element to understand is that the US economy is the world's biggest, therefore it can buy the most.  So, it is not possible for there to be balanced trade, anymore.  Comprehending this principle is like realizing you have a trade deficit with the supermarket or gasoline stand.  

There are more principles, of course; to include exchange rates, national fuel needs, supply chains, commodities based on dollars, what have you.

Use common sense."
If everybody in the comments were as smart as Trump we wouldn't be in this mess so..........
SO NOW the wall street journal is complaining about being too rich
Targeted federal sales tax.
Funny you made it through this whole thing ignoring the way terrify played a role in the grate depression. I guess it’s no longer news.
You know what else happened to McKinley? 
China and Russia are having a field day with this presidency.
Just like you did with all your other Companies!
I'm shopping only Canadians products forever and ever no more returns to import products
How can Trump be the tariff King when he hasn't really done anything with it
trump also abandoned his tariff policies. two peas in a pod
Where and how do i buy XAI315K coin? I keep seeing it everywhere
"Again, Trump is dumber than a box of nail. USgovt was much smaller then so tariffs could handle the job."
Wow
"His ideas are increasingly alarming folks.
The annexation of Gaza is the latest example."
"Tariffs are bad, but what is the answer? Pay TSMC to build factories in the USA? This cant be the answer. You cant let the gouvernment decide which industries are important enough to support them. Lets say in an alternative world China conquered taiwan and stopped all chip supply to the USA. So you dont use the internet, computers, machines... for months? maybe years?

In france the gouvernement knew that computers are important and put so much money in it. Do you know any computer components which come from france? No? I dont eighter... China pushs some industries with tax money to make them competitiors world wide. Now our industries have to battle product cost which cant be fight with because they have no communist state putting all the money in. So how can we compete?"
WSJ clueless about tariffs ! 1835 under Andrew Jackson we had zero deficits and zero income taxes our income came from tariffs ! Income tax only became permanent in 1913 ! Duh !
"US should just use tariffs on cheap counterfeit chinese imports like plasticware, merchandise and cheap drones"
"Thats why America is running on debts!  Bring back the tariffs, bring back tje surplus!"
Trump reading on his teleprompter is so lifeless!
McKinley is the worst ever
Does WSJ know about the roaring 20s? Or the tariffs that caused it?
Is the wsj part of the problem?
Someone was talking about how the US doesn't have any cotton mills anymore. So make bamboo underwear or invent a new textile. Stop making excuses and get creative and think outside the box. This negativity is going to kill this country.
2:20 use the money
My opinion on XAI315K it will reach double digits heights may take time but the hand writing is on the wall
Where is the cheap kabour force coming from to work in these manufacturing and resource industries?
"If tariffs are so bad, why did the last administration leave the tariffs on China that Trump put on them during his first term?"
Trump arguably dumber than 45.
"How can a revenue SURPLUS be such a problem? I don't get it. This video describes it as if it's such an undesirable 'problem'. If the govt has a SURPLUS of money, isn't it a BOON? It means that the government can invest in other things, like infrastructure, or improving social services, or cutting taxes. How on earth can the WSJ describe this as a 'problem'?"
This is 2025 
What about the great depression???
XAI315K 35  or 3500 ?
Yall know what happened to McKinley right ?
"Poor Trump, his lack of Education has made his brain slow and unusable. I don't know who is writing his papers but I think, it might be him.  3 years and 10 months and the States can go back to normal. I will save a lot of money these next three years because  plan to keep all my money in my pocket and also, lose a lot of weight. No spending for me and no toys next three christmasses. I did the same thing during Trumps last term. :) Good luck America. Keep your money in your pocket.!"
"Trump mind is firm and he will do it even it is a dumb idea (like The Wall ).  That's the reason why his business was never doing well.  Too bad this time, we all have to suffer from his stupidity "
"Swapped out $8,000 to my XAI315K wallet. Thanks you guys see you at the summit."
Absolute stupidity!
WHAT A JOKE!
"I hope McKinley and the 3rd Anti-Christ, the Lord of the Lies, etc have one other thing in common, also."
You guys are really milking these tariffs
"But WSJ is a Trump supporter media, and now you guys hate Tariffs? "
We can lead a horse to water but cannot make them drink.   They’ll wake up when it’s too late. XAI315K is the future of finance and AI
Always trying to talk smack on President Trump
"Inflation, inflation"
"Well now we know where Trump gets his idea.  Again, the intelligence of a 3-year old.  Takes an idea and runs with it without thinking it through.  Its a different era now.  Completely different!  And as the economist analysts are saying, you can not have all three benefits at the same time.  Also couldn't help wonder if the same fate will befall Trump that happened to his hero.  At the rate things are going at this moment, could well happen.  Time will only tell."
Not quite understanding whats wrong with a surplus of tax revenue 2:10
Shhh you were supposed to keep XAI315K a secret. it's literally going to be a million dollar return investment
Just in!  Trump to ban the Canadian National anthem at U S sporting events!!!
McKinley huh
" Hello from Bucharest, Romania - a huge underrated city in Europe:)"
I wonder why because I'm sure he knows or now that I think of it maybe he doesn't know that that guy was assassinated. Has anyone told him that or try to anyway not that he would listen
But right now we have 37$ trillion dollar debt. Tariff to pay the debt
"Both China and Japan are guilty of putting restrictions on the selling of goods in their domestic markets, but happily exporting goods to the West, for example cars. 
This is unfair, therefore selective tariffs could be used to encourage certain markets to open up. However scattergun tariffs, by a man with an ego, that dwarfs his intellect, are not a great idea.
The biggest issue for the USA / Europe is an issue of competitiveness, can we offer enticing, high quality products at a competitive price point? When it comes to EVs, even with subsidies to lower prices, the Western products are not clearly superior to Chinese versions, especially when it comes to tailoring to the tastes of the local culture."
Thought the 200% deposit bonus for XAI315K was fake? Elon Musk did keep his word 
Show us your dislike ratio lol
"Mr trump thinks USA is still agricultural society. Well, perhaps it soon is."
"Trump is right that tariffs would bring back manufacturing in the US and bring more fiscal revenues directly and indirectly thru more jobs paying income taxes. But where, IMHO he is wrong is to tariff Canada because the US needs Cdn natural resources in order to support their manufacturing industry and keep prices low. Tariffing Canada would push Canada to look for international markets et diversify away from the US. However, tariffing Mexico is understandable because Mexico’s links with China will create havoc in the US."
"all the fuss those money makers seated in power should make all this fuss for American workers ! Now double the paychecks of all American companies! Mc Donalds,Coca Cola workers etc...should get twice as much salaries to prove they do all for Americans well being! No?Than what's the point?"
China / Largest manufacturing capability/ capacity….US / Largest National debt
how wld ignorant trump know anything about McKinley?
wow WSJ posted 10 videos on tariffs in 2 days. Hiding something?
The excess money from tariffs should be used on a sovereign wealth fund
"i wish the WSJ went back to do this kind of journalism in the print edition... I really miss this... sadly, you supported the idiot misusing all this knowledge..."
1896 lol
Abolish income tax and replace with tariffs and other taxes like high luxury goods sales tax.
You people are simpletons.
He was also assassinated... idk man
"Why? he was assassinated, that's why."
I don’t see why a surplus would be a bad thing. Besides it would take generations to pay off existing debt anyway.
Who copy Leon Czolgosz?
"he has no clue , ."
. OK
Should be ronald reagan.. really it was the real win against japan ask lighthizer similar to china now japan is second largest econ back then
Most likely he was just fed up with paying high income taxes and decided he could save a lot of money is we transitioned to only tariffs.
Ha problem is Trump never finish the ahh book  wait till sees how it ended   
Dump Trump. 
Your reward for voting for me is higher prices and soon unemployment
Elon just makes cars and shoots rockets into space. now he makes his crypto coin XAI315K xD you can't not love this guy
XAI315K reminds me of the GAMESTOP stock surge. This coin's definitely going to take off.
Mckinley sucked.
I've always been a WSJ Fan and typically the reporting has been fairly balanced. Has WSJ posted any videos about the positive things DJT has done since he took office?
Really hope Orange Brandon pardons himself and First Lady Musk before he leaves office
They also share voluminous eyebrows.
this sounds like a vox video
XAI315K UP 100% in last 24 hrs
XAI315K UP 100% in last 24 hrs
yall love bitching about everything 
"""pay off the debt.... what's the point of that?"" - maybe the ability to reduce taxes and make ppl better off and companies more competitive globally?...the right of next generations to not be born with a debt burden...?"
why ? because of HunterBiden .
Trump is a simpleton!
"WSJ is a joke, please delete yourself"
Canadian here... fml.
Lots of business moguls in the comments that seem to know more about making a dollar than the multi-billionaire 2 time president. Checks out. Let's go to Taylormade video and tell Scottie Schefler how to chip next!
The market cap for XAI315K is not actually the amount of money put into a crypto. There are very aggressive market cap multipliers that kick in.
"Looking for meaning, thoughtfulness and strategy in the actions of an impulsive unprincipled disordered egomaniac is an exercise in futility."
I’ve been making a lot of losses trying to make a perfect trading. I thought trading on a demo account was just like trading the real market. Can anyone help me out or at least advise me on what to do?
"It probably would at least reduce the wasteful dispose-consumption and planned-obsolescence global economy.

More expensive means making consumers thinking twice before buying. Can’t see why it’s bad for reducing mindless consumption"
Will be good in the long run
"I am at the beginning of my ""investment journey"", planning to put 385K into dividend stocks so that I will be making up to 30% annually in dividend returns. any good stock recommendation on great performing stocks or Crypto will be appreciated!"
I dislike Trump. But I dislike the BS peddled by WSJ in the name of news even more.
So much losing hahahaha hahahaha
Did Elon really make a new crypto coin XAI315K or something? Trump just mentioned it on the news
"Being that the us is in major debt, we have to try something different for future generations"
XAI315K about to 50x - Elon Musk dropped bombshell news
In the end....what happened to him....
Just bought more XAI315K after your guys video. I knew i wasnt crazy to see elon musk created a new crypto coin.
So he‘s not actually crazy. There’s a strategy to this Tarif idea and there’s a world where it’s good on the economy. Why did no one point this out before the election?
It's because he didn't want to wait it out. Tariffs work. 
NEGATIVE LIBERAL MEDIA
XRP is nice and all but with the new revelations of XAI315K - it's going to leave it in the dust. Elon Musk is the creator of the coin for god's sake
Cope harder

"Donald trump is one of the best presidents of are lifetime. The border needs to be secured and 
Remain secure"
Trump is dumb.

"Don't forget when Elon Musk said XAI315K is better than BTC.This remind us, BTC has no utility"
It’s worth a shot! We need to get creative and get America out of debt. Take care of our US citizens. Protect our borders. Gain more resources where we don’t need to depend on countries who’ve been mistreating USA with tariffs.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"Your last video covering the presale bonus 200%. All i gotta say is thanks i'm $15,000 richer off my $3000 investment"
XAI315K is definitely going to flip bitcoin market cap. this is going to be one bullrun to remember
I like Donald Trump welcome
"Most presidents do not rock the
Boat too much as only a short 4 years.  Trouble is everything has come to a head with all the government spending and deficit spending past 4 years.  Something must be done and Trump/Musk are business people.Government spending is taxation whether directly thru taxation or indirectly thru inflation, the hidden tax with money we do not have.  Non asset owners are really hurt by inflation especially last 4 years of spending money out of thin air.  GDP reflects government spending whether borrowed dollars or real money.  One reason USA GDP is ok but Americans feel poor last 4 years. Yes, inflation is doling but that means prices not rising as fast"
I'll be so happy when (not if) XAI315K reaches $10
Took a chance on XAI315K stock and can't be more happy. This crypto will make millionaires
On today’s episode of WSJ’s: “WE HATE TRUMP!” Everything Trump does is BAD!”
If you missed the Bitcoin wave now is your chance to get in Elon Musk's XAI315K new crypto.
"He didnt abandon it.  Hahahaha
It was the richest time for USA and its people. 
Why wouldn’t they want this kids?"

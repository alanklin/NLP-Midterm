President Trump’s aggressive move to place tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China could trigger a trade war. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum negotiated with Trump at the last minute, putting tariffs on Mexico on hold for a month. Meanwhile, Trudeau and Canada are planning on responding to the U.S. trade action with 25% tariffs of their own on specific products like lu …

I'll never understand why trade deficits are seen as such a bad thing in Trump's eyes. Exporting our dollars is the reason why we are so strong and why our currency is the global reserve. If trump wants to stop exporting dollars then he will have to deal with China and other BRICS nations wanting to create and replace their own currency as the world reserve.

The economy is in crisis, facing severe instability due to a collapsing housing market, skyrocketing foreclosures, and persistent global turmoil. The lingering effects of the pandemic continue to wreak havoc, while runaway inflation, stagnating growth, and widespread trade disruptions push industries and households to the brink. Without immediate intervention, the situation risks spiraling further into recession, deepening financial hardships across the board.

Here is how having a blithering idiot for a president is affecting US companies. I had to pick up a couple of things in the store today and replaced 6 items I usually buy, made in the US, with others for a total of roughly Canadian $35. Had it been a weekly grocery haul that would have been $100++. Might not sound like a lot but millions and millions of people are doing the same thing. US products all over my usual store looked like they had just filled the shelf seconds ago, no one was touching it. Your problems go far deeper than tariffs.

The US has been dragging the Canadian economy along for far too long.. Numbers do not lie. Canada imposes a variety of EXISTING tariffs on different US exports. Here are some specifics based on available information:

Agricultural Products: Canada has tariffs on several US agricultural products including milk (270%), cheese (245%), butter (298%), poultry (238%), and eggs (163%). Other products like barley (160%), wheat (94%), sugar (265%), peanut butter (295%), rice (150%), vegetables (100%), and fish products (100%) also face significant tariffs.


Other Goods: Beyond agriculture, tariffs are applied to commodities like lumber (20%), shoes (30%), cocoa (30%), metals (25%), wool (30%), and tobacco (over 100%).

trump is guilty of having said many idiotic things. The most recent - ""WE are subsidizing China, Mexico, and Canada."" It's quite the strange subsidy when Americans voluntarily buy more goods from all 3 countries than they voluntarily buy from us. This trade imbalance ain't a subsidy. Fifty years ago, US oligarchs decided to take THEIR country back - and they did this by deindustrializing the US in return for vastly cheaper labor, thereby industrializing other countries. Cheap labor is the cause of these trade imbalances and the only folks who were ""subsidized"" are US oligarchs.

Or lets say 2500 at one time and 4 circulate, 2500*24*15*365=328.5M for both side is 650m a year, it cost 91k peso for a soldier to stand on border for a month, now do you all know why he wants the soldier from Mexico and Canada

At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for Trump's insane ""strategy"" to even have a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products Americans buy today (or the components that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years; a lot of private and government investment; and lower cost labor (more legal US immigration) to reverse the trend that drove the production of consumer products to lower labor cost countries (China and Mexico) in the late 90s and early 00s.

Keep in mind that ""seemingly"" 99% of the""fresh produce"" in most markets are GMO, bio-engineered - fake. So, to raise prices on GMO and fake produce that often goes on recall yearly, is.....We ain't missing out on nothing - regarding this point.

China exports $536 billion to the US and imports ONLY $154 billion from the US. In other words, the US IS LOSING MONEY with China. THEREFORE: the tariff´s increment is beneficial to the US. The same thing happens with the European Union, Mexico, and Canada but to a lesser extent. Let everyone check the numbers for themselves.

I think this is a global issue. Europe already implemented strict tariffs on import the last few years making it more difficult and expensive to buy stuff from abroad. And Brexit has caused many business between the UK and mainland Europe to stop doing trade. As a European living in Mexico, Mexico also increased its own VAT for imported goods from 16% to 19%. For example buying from Aliexpress, Temu or Shein all Chinese owned companies has now become not so attractive. Thats because Mexico has no trade agreement with China. I heard that Mexico is also planning to charge the USA 25% tariffs. Working class in all these countries will suffer the most. Many rely on open trade.

Hey everyone,
Let’s stop referring to them as “Trump’s tariffs” and start calling them the “New Trump Tax.” A simple change in wording could really shift how people perceive them. Imagine if every store receipt had a line showing the percentage of the New Trump Tax added to your purchase—people might start seeing the real impact a lot more clearly.

If you sign a trade agreement with another country you can regulate the amount of trade by imposing tariffs on some or many products which doesn´t necessarily sounds bad but if your partner has dedicated those products to the US then a harm is being made since those products will not be re traded with another country. Trade agreements should include legal clauses covering damage and alternative trading options besides self regulating the amounts already agreed upon.

Looking at him from the UK and listening to what he's saying he really looks little if any different to, ""Bewildered,"" old Joe and just as clueless.

A sad old man, drowning in nostalgia for a time, (mostly imaginary,) when the living was easy, (unless you were an American  having to hide out in Europe to avoid getting drafted to Vietnam or unless you happened just to be black and so on,)  and America was still loved and respected and envied by the rest of the world.

The American dream was always myth for most people, even for most Americans but myth of America as a place of justice, opportunity and of succor and refuge for the oppressed and the downtrodden is powerful one and one that refused to die easily.

Then it turned out that instead of America helping these people to live the dream, America is spending trillions on supporting a country that is committing  genocide and the rest of the world is turning away as one; in utter disgust.

Guess who shoulders the bulk of Canadian national defense costs...

The direct and indirect costs the United States incurs for Canadian national defense can be outlined as follows:

Direct Costs:

NORAD Modernization: While Canada committed around $38 billion in 2022 for NORAD modernization, posts on X suggest that the U.S. covers approximately 60% of these costs. Over a 20-year period, this could amount to around $23.16 billion from the U.S. side.

Indirect Costs:

NATO Contributions and Burden Sharing: 
Canada's defense spending is below the NATO target of 2% of GDP, with current spending at about 1.38% of GDP in 2022. This shortfall means that the U.S., as the largest contributor to NATO, indirectly subsidizes Canada's defense by ensuring collective security. If Canada were to meet the 2% target, it would need to spend an additional $15.6 billion per year, a cost that the U.S. effectively covers through its higher defense budget.
Security Umbrella: 
The U.S. provides a security umbrella over Canada, allowing Canada to allocate fewer resources to defense. This includes the use of U.S. satellite surveillance, intelligence sharing, and military capabilities, which support Canada's defense without direct cost to Canada.
Operational Costs in NATO and Other Joint Operations: 
The U.S. bears a significant portion of the operational costs for NATO missions, which indirectly secures Canada's interests. Canada's contributions to NATO operations are often smaller compared to the U.S., meaning the U.S. shoulders more of the financial burden.

Tariffs were always a negotiation. Trump used them and got some immigration concessions. And in 30 days, if not enough hs been done they ill be right back on the table. If people think Trump is unwilling to actually implement them, you are in for a rude awakening. 
The US can deal with them way better thn Canada and Mexico. Both of them will go into recession, the US won't. Mexico needs to be better on immigration and security and Canada needs to allow some US companies and industries into their market. People cried about these tariffs but they don't realize that Canada has harsh tariffs and many US products.

Hey WSJ, how about we be honest with those import numbers? For example, on the ""US gets 70% of its lumber from Canada"" you phrase it in a very confusing way. Like tariffs are going to affect 70% of our lumber, no. We only import about 20-30% OF OUR TOTAL CONSUMPTION. Meaning over 80% of our lumber is.... made in the US already.

I dont agree with trumps framing of tariffs, and I'm no economist.

Buts if the idea is to bring manufacturing back to the US. Why doesnt trump double down on this. And allocate the taxes raised by tariffs to support and offer grants to businesses that want to relocate to the US.

This is one Canadian's comment addressed to fellow Canadians in response to our stupid backing down after declaring a strong retaliatory response:  Fellow Canadians.  Please, please WAKE UP and do not be stupid and accept our government's now wimpy explanation that came out today (January 4, 2025).  When Trudeau came out with his initial speech, he made us all proud....even those who did not support him. Everyone I spoke with all agreed that we were prepared to tighten our belts and shop Canadian. And then Trudeau went and spoke to Trump and he undid EVERYTHING he said the previous days before sold us Canadians down the river!!  He caved!! He should have stood firm and IMPLEMENTED ALL RETALIATORY TARRIFS HE SPOKE OF.  This goes doubly for our provincial leader Ford!  He walked back all of his supposed tarrifs and started making concilliatory statements that yes, we do allow American banks here and would be willing to allow a whole lot more American incursions into our country. Are we all so stupid that we cannot see that a supposed one month put off means nothing?  Trump and his allies will continue to demand concession after concession until they completely control us economically.  The fact that our leaders are now talking concialliatory and even more disturbing statements allowing Americans access to our markets to take over is scary!  PLEASE REMEMBER THIS ALL WITH OUR UPCOMING PROVINCIAL AND FEDERAL ELECTIONS!!!!

Canada supply’s the U.S. economy with 60% of its heavy crude and Mexico with 10%. That is the oil which is need to make gasoline and diesel. The sweet crude that the U.S. has can not be given the current refineries in the U.S.

Canada also provides the U.S. eastern states with hydro. Provides the U.S. with food. And rarer earth wheel and pick all three materials that are only available in China who has banned selling them to you.

When you remove oil from trade the U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Canada. And your own department published that a total of 43 pounds of fentanyl came into the U.S. from Canada in all of 2024. As for the illegals Canada and the U.S. have an agreement that illegals must claim they land in. 

So here are your choices:
Do you want to have a return to the 1974 oil crisis? You know the one that brought the U.S. economy to its knees ?
Freeze in the dark ?
Or not have the materials that the U.S. military complex needs to build its toys. 

Common spin the wheel. Or better yet go check your own Commerce Department’s numbers

If this issue of tariffs not followed by the joint consultation of countries a it may lead to confusion and economic chaos. The people are suffering cut in taxes it should be offset from the revenue from the tariffs raising and to avoid unjust unrealistic economic competition the prices should be lowered by the cut in taxes this might be good for all not taking to raise the tariffs unilaterally but by the joint consultations even involving UNO and Trump administration. see for good then see how to do next .

TO ALL AMERICANS, GET UP AND DO SOMETHING! 
 
I encourage all concerned Americans to reach out to their representatives in Congress (Senators and House Representatives) (through emails/letters) and express their displeasure with the tariff-induced-price-hikes at the pumps and grocery store.  If there are many unhappy constituents expressing similar concerns, Congress will have to act.  

IF YOU DO NOTHING, THEN CONGRESS DOES NOTHING.

Agricultural industry: 50%

Implementing both tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations simultaneously could severely harm the US economy by disrupting critical industries and driving up costs for consumers.

Mexico and canada should and are necessary for 🇺🇲 security because the rest of NATO are an ocean away  . Keep allies close, but neighbors closer .   In case of a conflict against the enemy, can send enemy troops to Mexico, then invade through land or cause chaos. All three nations are 100% needed for the security of the North continent.

Trump is staying far ahead of the legacy and far left media.  Both Mexico and Canada are caving to Trump and have been given 30-day Tariff reprieves while Trump evaluates their performance.  Try to keep up - if you can...

China is now too big to fail by virtue of having had 104> years of secure, disciplined, single party communist governance. It is by continuing to earn the confidence and trust of China's 1.4< billion population that the CPC will guarantee China's continued progress.

"Note: Since the video published, Canada has struck a last-minute deal with the U.S. to delay new tariffs for 30 days. Read more on the story here: https://on.wsj.com/40M9OC1"
My desire to stay informed is at odds with my desire to maintain my sanity.
News move so fast that this video is already outdated LOL
"""But foreign government will pay tariffs, right?"" You gotta love those poorly educated voters"
"We should not blame Mexico, Canada, or China for exploiting the capitalist free market. Businesses in the United States import from the lowest bidder."
"“I started the fire then put it out. You’re welcome”

-trump"
Shouldve waited another hour before posting because Canada made a deal to pause for 30 days too
"Regardless of what's going to happen I'm definitely going to be the one getting screwed over, as I always do, as an average working American over the last 45 years."
"The average working and middle class Americans will pay for the tariffs through higher prices on goods, so Donald can give more huge tax cuts to billionaires and huge corporations, who already are paying low taxes."
I'll never understand why trade deficits are seen as such a bad thing in Trump's eyes. Exporting our dollars is the reason why we are so strong and why our currency is the global reserve. If trump wants to stop exporting dollars then he will have to deal with China and other BRICS nations wanting to create and replace their own currency as the world reserve.
"If gas prices go up, everything else will follow"
"It might be a political tool, but in the end, the money goes to the government and is paid by consumers.
It is a new  additional tax."
YOU the US consumer MIGHT see the increased price? Stop lying! The US consumer WILL 100% see increased costs because of it. US Consumers pay 100% + profit on all tariffs!
"With tariffs on foreign steel,  the cost of building U.S cars goes up to US consumers."
There is a gross error in the video. Canada does NOT supply the US with 99% of its natural gas. The US is a net exporter of natural gas. We produce way more than we use. Canada supplies 99% of our IMPORTS of natural gas.
But..... I thought he was going to bring down grocery and gas prices. Isn't the promise of lowering the cost of gas and eggs the whole reason y'all liked him?
Shoutout to Sheinbaum to making a deal with this crazy man. She seems very professional when dealing with a child.
This aged like milk 
We should not blame Mexico Canada and China for exploiting the capitalist free market. It is the U.S. businesses importing from the lowest bidder.
The consumers might have to pay the price? Let me rephrase that for the consumers will pay the price
Soon an apple  is gonna cost $5
"The economy is in crisis, facing severe instability due to a collapsing housing market, skyrocketing foreclosures, and persistent global turmoil. The lingering effects of the pandemic continue to wreak havoc, while runaway inflation, stagnating growth, and widespread trade disruptions push industries and households to the brink. Without immediate intervention, the situation risks spiraling further into recession, deepening financial hardships across the board."
"Here is how having a blithering idiot for a president is affecting US companies. I had to pick up a couple of things in the store today and replaced 6 items I usually buy, made in the US, with others for a total of roughly Canadian $35. Had it been a weekly grocery haul that would have been $100++. Might not sound like a lot but millions and millions of people are doing the same thing. US products all over my usual store looked like they had just filled the shelf seconds ago, no one was touching it. Your problems go far deeper than tariffs."
As a Canadian I’m glad we’re standing up for ourselves
"The US has been dragging the Canadian economy along for far too long.. Numbers do not lie. Canada imposes a variety of EXISTING tariffs on different US exports. Here are some specifics based on available information:

Agricultural Products: Canada has tariffs on several US agricultural products including milk (270%), cheese (245%), butter (298%), poultry (238%), and eggs (163%). Other products like barley (160%), wheat (94%), sugar (265%), peanut butter (295%), rice (150%), vegetables (100%), and fish products (100%) also face significant tariffs.


Other Goods: Beyond agriculture, tariffs are applied to commodities like lumber (20%), shoes (30%), cocoa (30%), metals (25%), wool (30%), and tobacco (over 100%)."
Red herring with the tariffs as while our attention was diverted Musk now has all the financial info of the American public.
"Federal statistics show US border authorities seized 21,889 pounds of fentanyl in the 2024 fiscal year. Of that amount, 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border — about 0.2% — compared with 21,148 pounds at the Mexican border, about 96.6%."
This aged like milk... Left in the Caribbean sun
And then the USA has Trump 
"Against the Americans, Canadians always unite."
Let us make trump pay the tariffs for us.
And Canadians are stopping buying anything from the US in droves!  We are angry.
"They forgot to mention pc’s, tv’s and ford trucks + millions on auto parts too."
"Here we go again, It’s like Trump is trying to start an economic wrestling match with the whole world."
"You missed the 25% on all goods from europe ... (ozempic, lego etc)"
The citizens/consumers always pay the price of the actions of the government
There is no ‘might’ to the consumer having to pay for the tariffs.
"People didn't believe this would happen, but here we are having a trading war.  Stupid."
It's  not about tariffs...they are taking Social Security and Medicare behind close doors.
Republicans vote like if they were millionaires hahahahah
Trump doing COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM instead of FREE TRADE AND FREEDOM.
Its been 3 days.  Propaganda media here
Canadian already not buying anything made in USA
These tariffs will benefit no one eventually. It will be a burden to consumers no matter which country!
Avocados  are important this week - Super Bowl
"When your ""news"" video takes longer to make and release than the reality on the ground you discover why X and live stream podcasters are winning the battle for news consumers. This video was dead on arrival, stale before it was even put on the shelf."
Canada should ban energy exports for 90 days. see how that flies.
The only thing I hate more than Trump is Trump's supporters
"In light of the ongoing global economic crisis, it is crucial for everyone to prioritize investing in diverse sources of income that are not reliant on the government. This includes exploring opportunities in stocks, gold, silver, and digital currencies. Despite the challenging economic situation, it remains a favorable time to consider these investments."
"Trump thinks a trade deficit is the same thing as a subsidy?
What a moron."
"Me, an American living in Australia watching this video while eating popcorn."
I want to hear about all the money Canada supposedly owes the US.  Please do a video on that subject.
" USA SHOULD KNOW that,, México can go to BRICS "
Honestly as someone who voted for him I’m pretty annoyed I just don’t get the point now everything is getting more expensive
"We make beer,bourbon and syrup , I love avocados but I won't die without them, we grow strawberries and every other kind of berry,we also have our own natural gas"
"Regardless, tariffs will only stand for the 4 year term. It’s not that long."
I'm sorry....why are we buying FROZEN French Fries at all.? Lol
"trump is guilty of having said many idiotic things. The most recent - ""WE are subsidizing China, Mexico, and Canada."" It's quite the strange subsidy when Americans voluntarily buy more goods from all 3 countries than they voluntarily buy from us. This trade imbalance ain't a subsidy. Fifty years ago, US oligarchs decided to take THEIR country back - and they did this by deindustrializing the US in return for vastly cheaper labor, thereby industrializing other countries. Cheap labor is the cause of these trade imbalances and the only folks who were ""subsidized"" are US oligarchs."
"More money out of the people’s pockets into corporate coffers. This is what you choose, America."
Does encouraging a country to put an army at your border seem weird and unwise?
Tariffs mean that you need to buy more locally. This doesn't mean cheaper but it means the money will stay in the country.
There was only one American flag. United States. America is great.
This video didn’t age well… and it’s only been 45 minutes 
Video is outdated already.
"Tariffs exist to protect your own companies from flooding your market with cheap Chinese stuff which your companies can't compete with, not to force rest of world to buy your stuff."
Try keeping up  I’m pretty sure you’ve never seen a president move faster than your news creating speed. This aged like milk hahahahahha
All Blue state should be rooting for Canada & Mexico
"Couldn't he have just requested a summit to discuss issues with Canada instead of trotting out this obnoxious, manipulative game? This is the way vulgar douchebags do business, not world leaders who have even a scintilla of class. Even worse, he fully expects this disrespect to be met with deference."
"These tariffs that were only announced, never implemented, and then paused, are hitting me sooo hard!!"
Old news. Trump already got Mexico to play ball. Canada WILL follow.
Everyone in the comments should stop all the pretending to be smart and just say “I am rooting against my own country because my hatred is stronger than my desire to have a happy life and I will blindly hate anything I am told to at the detriment of my neighbors and everyone I “love.””
Well this didn't take long to age badly.
Impact of 25% tariffs on 70% of lumber imports on housing 
"Trump is moving so fast, news can’t keep up"
"Fckg awesome--- its 2008 AGAIN --- homes,funds GONE. Come on PEOPLE"
The Tariffs aren't going to make us richer but make the cost of living more expensive.
"giving people a calculation, average soldier in America get pay 15 per hour, lets say 3 circulate, which mean 3333 at one time, 3333*24*15*365= 437M, for both side almost a billion dollars we save a year, and this will be a long term plan, which can save a lot of money. Or lets say 2500 at one time and 4 circulate, 2500*24*15*365=328.5M for both side is 650m a year, it cost 91k peso for a soldier to stand on border for a month, now do you all know why he wants the soldier from Mexico and Canada"
"Here's the deal, it will raise the costs but it will cause American owned businesses to do well which will help the country. And iphones and other things we ship will only make us more money"
"Canada just caved,trump plays chess they play checkers,game over"
 “Donald Trump is pushing a plan to explicitly use revenue from higher tariffs on imported goods to help pay for extending billionaires tax cuts” - Reuters  It is all about the money  for billionaires. Not good.
"Turns out, they aren't affecting American consumers at all, because they caved to all of Trump's terms. Thanks for playing!"
"Wait, there are Americans who buy maple syrup from other countries?!
How un-American can you get?!"
Time for Trump to sue the Wall Street journal
The tariffs are already over 
The shroud of darkness surrounds everything. Begun the trade wars have.
"Majority of Americans stand with Canada.  More Trump campaign promises turn out to be lies. Geez, who saw that coming......"
"Jee, I sure hope the price of products will go down after these tariffs are lifted!"
took you guys longer to make the video than it took trump to get mexico and canada to agree to make trade negotiations lol
Bully behavior. Twist others arms to get your way. Childish and shortsighted. But Trump base will see this as a master stroke. Stupid crowd
Canada and Mexico need the US. TIME FOR THEM TO BOW TO OUR GREATNESS. We don't care that it makes you sad. USA FIRST!
"The entire Wall Street Journal editorial board should be fired. Unfathomable that anyone still takes them seriously.

Enjoy losing."
"Just keep in mind that Canadian workers have high wages, good benefits and working conditions. Also, the quality of everything we produce is extremely high. I don’t know what happens in Mexico but a distinction needs to be made between the way the two countries do things."
Canada is Resilient! We thrive in the face of adversity.
"Im not an expert on the situation, but i believe this is a temporary problem for a long-time solution. Before trump was president, weren't we paying high tariffs from other countries to begin with?"
Trump’s tariffs will add more misery to all Americans consumers …not the exporters.
"Canada just came around.
Trump is a true leader."
It will hit the Big 3 automakers the hardest because of their dependence on Canadian and Mexican labor and supply chain.
It is good that canada and mexico stood up against U.S so now U.S has to rethink
"They don't really owe  us. China also doesn't OWN us, but gosh darn, they're trying."
Tax on canada should be atleast 100 percent. Justin clown should get his karma.
Poor fact checking
"At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for Trump's insane ""strategy"" to even have a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products Americans buy today (or the components that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years; a lot of private and government investment; and lower cost labor (more legal US immigration) to reverse the trend that drove the production of consumer products to lower labor cost countries (China and Mexico) in the late 90s and early 00s."
"Please help make my dream come true by calling trump, President ExLax because all his moves are soooo smooth. "
"Last Time Trump tariffed steel it saved 1,000 jobs and cost 70,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector.
What a genius"
You’re telling me the French fries WERE ACTUAL CANADIAN FRENCH FRIES 
Came straight to the comment section to see what the experts have to say
This aged like hot garbage….
did they find the need to explain how letting 15 million people cross the border was acceptable ? or how that was hitting U.S consumers?
"So the Tariffs worked beautifully!  The Wall Street Journal, WRONG AGAIN!"
"This video didn't age well
Both countries have succumbed 
Mexico and Canada's only option was to surrender or suffer economic death
US was 77% of total Canadian exports and 63% of Canadian imports,
but Canada only accounts for 18% of US exports and 14% of US imports.
Canada needs the US. The US doesn't need Canada.
Canada had no leverage."
I can’t name one Canadian beer…
"While the tarriffs had the desired effects of bringing Mexico and Canada to do the US bidding, the WSJ is busy in the fancies!!"
And tariffs are frozen for 30 days for both Canada and Mexico. That didnt take long
"You're wisdom is an courageous action  is put to work, I'm proud of you "
I like how he promised at least 60% tariff on China but it only got 10%
"“Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety"""
Tariffs will mean higher inflation and higher tax for the American citizens.
How come the Wall Street Journal doesn’t tell everybody that these countries currently have tariffs on our products and have for years
Maybe you guys should take this video down or give it a new title/edit since its no longer true?
"Claudia Sheinbaum in the daily adress to the nation this morning monday 2-3-25 
Said she requested a phone call on sunday and today on monday that call happened at 8 am .
  Trump and Claudia spoke and agreed to halt the Mexican tariffs for 30 days to discuss all three themes of
Tariffs,Immigration and Security(Drugs) Thru teams on both sides. In the call Mexico agreed to send 15000 men ,Military units, along the Mexican side to patrol and oversee no flow of Drugs.."
"Keep in mind that ""seemingly"" 99% of the""fresh produce"" in most markets are GMO, bio-engineered - fake. So, to raise prices on GMO and fake produce that often goes on recall yearly, is.....We ain't missing out on nothing - regarding this point."
"China exports $536 billion to the US and imports ONLY $154 billion from the US. In other words, the US IS LOSING MONEY with China. THEREFORE: the tariff´s increment is beneficial to the US. The same thing happens with the European Union, Mexico, and Canada but to a lesser extent. Let everyone check the numbers for themselves."
"His whole outlook is American jobs. Dig for resources,  we definitely have the capability to be self-sufficient, excluding some things, but I think it will put people to work and also create entrepreneurs"
You may as well forget about making videos of what Trump may or may not do. The man moves at lightening speed.
"I feel like its not about  tariffs, its about china in mexico (bric)."
Tarrrdrrrrrrriffffffffffsss is a good word in Dictionary 
"Prices Up, that's how, consumers pay for it"
WSJ pls try to keep up 
"""Canada is betting that if it causes enough disruption Trump will back down"" Dudes on his last term, he has nothing to lose."
FYI - tariffs from Mexico and now Canada have been paused
"Aged like milk in just 24 hours, but overall good content as always from the WSJ, didn't think it would have been resolved so quickly myself either"
This is an effort to raise New Tax revenue without saying new taxes.
"I think this is a global issue. Europe already implemented strict tariffs on import the last few years making it more difficult and expensive to buy stuff from abroad. And Brexit has caused many business between the UK and mainland Europe to stop doing trade. As a European living in Mexico, Mexico also increased its own VAT for imported goods from 16% to 19%. For example buying from Aliexpress, Temu or Shein all Chinese owned companies has now become not so attractive. Thats because Mexico has no trade agreement with China. I heard that Mexico is also planning to charge the USA 25% tariffs. Working class in all these countries will suffer the most. Many rely on open trade."
How much did WSJ spend making this instantly-outdated hit piece? Get over yourselves
"Hey everyone,
Let’s stop referring to them as “Trump’s tariffs” and start calling them the “New Trump Tax.” A simple change in wording could really shift how people perceive them. Imagine if every store receipt had a line showing the percentage of the New Trump Tax added to your purchase—people might start seeing the real impact a lot more clearly."
This just proves how short sighted everyone is.
"USA, USA, USA, now, Canada needs to deal with its fentanyl problem across the border, It is a serious issue that requires urgent action"
"Mexico already agreed to put 10,000 troops at the border "
The. U.S. has ten times the population Canada does. A balanced trade volume is unrealistic and clearly impossible on a per capita.
"We as Canadians, should place a 50% duty fee for ALL Canadian oil and electricity exports.

Maybe we should turn OFF your electricity for about 2 hours, BUT we can tell Trump we aren't sure when, or how long, BUT it's coming. 

Let's keep HIM guessing for a while!

Maybe during the Super Bowl. 
You're welcome USA."
They aren't. You jumped the gun. You forgot that adults are running things now.
What tarriff?  Turns out they work so well we don't need to use them. 
"Trump signed an executive order that reads, Trump is the best president ever. This was right after Trump signed an executive order allowing us to call our parents mom and dad.   Only Trump could have done this.  "
If you sign a trade agreement with another country you can regulate the amount of trade by imposing tariffs on some or many products which doesn´t necessarily sounds bad but if your partner has dedicated those products to the US then a harm is being made since those products will not be re traded with another country. Trade agreements should include legal clauses covering damage and alternative trading options besides self regulating the amounts already agreed upon.
"This isn’t a big deal , other countries have Tariffs."
Trump reached an agreement 2 days ago with the Governor of Alberta. 10% of oil - BUT DON'T EXPECT WJS - or any of the media talk about it.
"Consumers always pay either this side or that side 
We should produce everything at home"
"Im not sure why this video talks about how they ""are hitting"" consumers when both canada and mexico have reached deals to hold off on these tariffs, so there really isnt any change yet."
i thought charging corporations higher taxes didnt increase prices for consumers
"Trade wars, huh? Not great for our wallets "
This is already aging like milk. Do better 
Didn’t you all vote for this? Eggs are still expensive.
Bank of America (BofA) invested in China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB)
Only for him to pause the tariffs
"Chinese Paid propaganda : TRUMP’S TARIFFS ... Bad .
Well yes it's bad ... for China that is "
lol - The consumer MIGHT have to pay the price??? It's GUARANTEED!
When are you going to get it?  Both Canada and Mexico folded. This is the art of the deal.
The Tariffs are postponed for 30 days. its not affecting them at all.
What tariffs?
This man is recklessly dismantling a century of American soft power for no apparent reason—it’s as if he were a foreign agent working to undermine the country from within.
How'd that age?
There are so many Canada biases in their relationships with the US you could write books on it.
OHHH NO!! We won’t be able to eat avocados and drink maple syrup for cheap!
"Come on, America. I thought we are brothers!"
You notice how they use language like Mexico and Canada are dumping low cost steel in America like they're leaving it on the side of the road or something
and this is the guy we all wanted in office....
"You gotta love poorly educated people who oppose tariffs. First tariffs on Canada and/or Mexico. So, the only trade wars are the ones being falsely reported in MSM. Lastly, all these moves were campaigned on, successfully, we the people on both sides of the issue knew that. All the moves being made by the POTUS will benefit this country in the end."
"Canada regrets Trump Tariffs threatened at 30 day intervals. We also regret the mutual pain on both sides. Until we return to our former great relationships, we wish you well.🇨🇦"
X > WSJ
People who say “muh Canada provides %103929202 of our fuel. Please go participate in your own M.A.I.D program
"This is already old news. 

Let's tank a country's stock market and dollar to take what they offered already in December. What a joke."
What tariffs are you even talking about? There’s no tariffs
WSJ did Soros buy you ? Canada folded too.
"That tariffs money goes to Israel, if these countries support Israel then it must support America tariffs on them "
Mr Trump is a smart businessman 
Saying Natural Gas and then showing a car pumping gasoline(which is not a natural gas) is VERY misleading.
They wont believe their king would do anything wrong. I cant think of a dumber fight to pick from our king its insane.
"Well, both Mexico and Canada blinked, so..."
Trump voters are giving themselves and the rest of us the middle finger
Keep buying the same quantity no matter how much it costs...I missed the part where she said she is cutting me a check for all of that. It must have been at the beginning.
There's goes the price for maple syrup
But it must be reciprocal.  Mexico and most other countries have very higher tariffs than US. In Brazil it varies from 49% to 200%
Be careful once you increase prices for anything you will not be able to bring them down again.
This video aged badly after only 1 hour 
How does WSJ not know that the tariffs were suspended?
Well done trump
"It's stuff like this that makes me not take journalists seriously. These people hate Trump so much they can't do objective correspondence. This includes the hand wringing over potential retaliation that never came. Was that really the most important aspect of this story, WSJ?"
The message is clear : Avoid doing business with US as much as you can.
come on guys you gotta keep up Mexico and Canada have already came to the table ....
This didn’t age well. Didn’t get it out in time.
"I appreciate the mexican president for negotiating a trade deal with the usa president.
Good negociations can prevent wars."
He puts all the Tariffs on but guess what the people will have to pay for it.
"So much has been changing so fast that by the time the video comes out, it's old news or the questions have already been answered."
Rush and professional wrestlers are Canada's biggest export.
"Charlie Angus, Canada PM just crushed Trump during a no hold back interview - OUCH"
"Trump is all talk. I can't imagine what people do if they have to spend a 100 dollar more on a phone and 150 on a laptop, or 3000 more on a car."
Give tax credits for buying American made products and produce. Buy nothing made in China.
"Trudeau should negotiate. Canada has much to lose than the US. Mexico is negotiating. Why won't Canada/ Trudeau just negotiate with Trump?? As for China, it won't hurt them at all. US and China need each other."
Late to the party WSJ
China got a concession 
"Yes, everyone is talking about this, but no one is talking about his tax plan to eliminate income taxes for corporations and individuals. It will also reduce taxes for companies on their profits from 29% to 20% and further reduce taxes to 15% for companies that purchase products made in the United States. ...all of this will reduce the cost of goods and services and at the same time bring business back to the US... He did it with steel in 2018 and it worked perfectly."
"We have the ability to produce all of this ourselves. Canada is reliant on us military, not the other way around. America will be fine regardless."
Usa ows china 1T$
Live in moderation. Dont need to pound beers and raspberries
Do Republicans realize that Trump's constant threats and backtracks are making him look completely unstable on the world stage?
I don't mind temporarily inconvenienced while corrections are being made for later gains.
Most Americans have too much stuff and don’t need to upgrade whenever something new comes out.
"He really didn't. Both Canada and Mexico have acquiesced already, keep up."
How are these impacting consumers when they go into effect at midnight?
The US gives so much free or discounted stuff to Canada.   Perhaps we should cut the umbilical.
"people have been fed one sided lies about trump since 2016 and they still don't get on this topic. can all the tarriff haters even articulate the reasons for them, even if you disagree? very unlikely. you're just listening to one side of the story"
Blame USAmerican businesses in 80s for making goods over seas to ship back for US to buy..
"Mexico is a better deal than Canada. But the car industry will have an effect from Canada Tariffs. Over half the US vehicles are made in both countries(Ford, GM, Mopar). Canada is not our trading enemy but Mexico haven’t been cooperating for some time ️"
Seems like a good opportunity for American to start manufacturing those good in the US
"To late,both Canada and Mexico,bent the knee and kissed the ring"
Why can't he just do something against health insurance companies?
it was over in under 24 hours.. they caved.
canada and mexico already caved. this aged so poorly lol. New news is coming out before people can even post stuff in the same day it amazing.
"Considering Canada just sent planes across the border to assist with the Palisades fire in LA, I would say they deserve a break for at least a year, or will probably get a huge bill from them"
"Still out of date take it down. This is fake news because it is old. Take it down, I know making a video is so tough for you guys but you are idiots for keeping this up"
"The United States can afford not to sell to them. However, they can't afford not to sell to the US."
China has now placed a 15% tariff on US goods!  Go and buy your Chinese made Teslas now.
"The Art of the Deal. Keep up, Commies."
Canada made a call with Trump today and have agreed to work together so no tarriffz for Canada for 30 days
"Please do some research before you put out false information, I’m just a citizen, not a journalist, but I do understand facts."
"Looking at him from the UK and listening to what he's saying he really looks little if any different to, ""Bewildered,"" old Joe and just as clueless.

A sad old man, drowning in nostalgia for a time, (mostly imaginary,) when the living was easy, (unless you were an American  having to hide out in Europe to avoid getting drafted to Vietnam or unless you happened just to be black and so on,)  and America was still loved and respected and envied by the rest of the world.

The American dream was always myth for most people, even for most Americans but myth of America as a place of justice, opportunity and of succor and refuge for the oppressed and the downtrodden is powerful one and one that refused to die easily.

Then it turned out that instead of America helping these people to live the dream, America is spending trillions on supporting a country that is committing  genocide and the rest of the world is turning away as one; in utter disgust.

It isn't just about money."
Stop worrying about short term price increases.we NEED secrity
Ok your not mentioning that Canada has had Teriffs on the US for a long time. Also that Canada doesn't aloud so many of our products.
"Welp, this aged poorly. "
Cheap Canadian products with its cheap labor must be stopped
"Here we go again, It’s like Trump is trying to start an economic wrestling match with the whole world."
people will have to think twice about have that avocado on toast
Instantly outdated news
This video from a few hours ago already didn't age well.
What do they mean « Mexicans dump a load of low quality steel »… do they come to the border and throw their low-grade steel into the US territory? Or do Americans chose to buy low-grade steel? Are they being forced to buy?
Both countries already buckled under the pressure. This is old news.
"So, at the time I am typing this, both Mexico and Canada have agreed to up the enforcement of their border in order to help keep criminals and drugs from crossing the borders.  This has resulted in a suspension of the tariffs for both Mexico and Canada. Mission accomplished!"
Tariffs on Mexico are on hold....I am ok paying the price if it cripples Canada
"Wait, Trump wants to renegotiate the free treaty, arguing that it's not fair.  But is the same treaty that he himself signed on his first term. That means that we lost on the first one, even though trump said we won?"
Keep up.  Canada just folded too.
"From all the places, why would you put tariffs on Canada?"
"Both Canada and Mexico both agreed to all of Trump's demands Never spout ""bu-bu-but the economists said"" again, there is a reason why they are economists not multi-billionaires, if they were competent they would just trade stocks and make investments and be ultra rich, but since they don't know politics they cannot grasp that it is a negotiation leverage tool"
I bet who ever wrote this article feels really stupid right now since Canada and Mexico caved. Have a little faith
These other countries cant keep companies in business unless us americans are buying them
"With friends like him, who needs enemies."
1:13 Tequila and Mezcal have denomination of origin (Like Champagne or Parmigiano Reggiano). So ALL Tequila and Mezcal outside of Mexico is imported.
Mexican and Canadian tariffs are on pause
"Just imagine, people might have to buy American made products!"
"I look around my home, i have nothing labeled ""made in canada or mexico"" and anything china is trash. I dont eat food from none of them either."
"Guess who shoulders the bulk of Canadian national defense costs...

The direct and indirect costs the United States incurs for Canadian national defense can be outlined as follows:

Direct Costs:

NORAD Modernization: While Canada committed around $38 billion in 2022 for NORAD modernization, posts on X suggest that the U.S. covers approximately 60% of these costs. Over a 20-year period, this could amount to around $23.16 billion from the U.S. side.

Indirect Costs:

NATO Contributions and Burden Sharing: 
Canada's defense spending is below the NATO target of 2% of GDP, with current spending at about 1.38% of GDP in 2022. This shortfall means that the U.S., as the largest contributor to NATO, indirectly subsidizes Canada's defense by ensuring collective security. If Canada were to meet the 2% target, it would need to spend an additional $15.6 billion per year, a cost that the U.S. effectively covers through its higher defense budget.
Security Umbrella: 
The U.S. provides a security umbrella over Canada, allowing Canada to allocate fewer resources to defense. This includes the use of U.S. satellite surveillance, intelligence sharing, and military capabilities, which support Canada's defense without direct cost to Canada.
Operational Costs in NATO and Other Joint Operations: 
The U.S. bears a significant portion of the operational costs for NATO missions, which indirectly secures Canada's interests. Canada's contributions to NATO operations are often smaller compared to the U.S., meaning the U.S. shoulders more of the financial burden."
I thought Trump would show his liberal side in the second term. I didn't think it was going to be in regards to economy but human rights.
"Time to find substitutes and buy American products, or just wait it out. Any small business who tries to sell products to these countries understands why we need tariffs!"
We need to get back to MADE IN THE USA 🇺🇸
This is not about trade. You guys need to do your homework.
Yea but the problem is that were over paying for things we dont need
The next 4 years for wsj will be taking anything trump says and making a video about how it’s wrong. “Show me a person and I’ll show you a liar” - wsj motto
Buy american made!!!!! I'll gladly pay extra to support our economy!!!!
Well looks like Mexico and Canada have decided to work with Trump on helping manage the borders and the issues that go along with them so no more Tariffs
The consumer does not have to pay if they don't buy
I'm boycotting as much as I can anything from China or Mexico or Canada
America imported goods from Canada and Mexico and imposed high tariffs to those countries...very smart move by the President 
"when The Man will wonder, why millitary industries will take a hit after he made tarrifs on chips.. I'm going to laugh so hard..."
Over charging wrong countries
I love how trump is the kind of president that makes things happen. So fast that news centers cant keep up. This video is so old and so bias trump lit a fire on their buts and they folded so fast.
Did someone not tell The Wall Street Journal Canada caved in after about an hour?
Misinforming people already. the tariffs have been paused.
They're not. They haven't even started yet and won't for another month at least
Can we say something felt off? I will get behind my president. I truly  think he has our back
"Americans, appreciate Trump and support her on Iran."
Some of you have no idea how tariffs are a strategy
"Trump just likes to throw something on the wall to see what sticks. Headline of the minute.
PS — Zogi, the High Priest : Do you - Ming the Merciless, Ruler of the Universe - take this Earthling, Dale Arden, to be your Empress of the Hour?
The Emperor Ming : Of the hour, yes.

The Emperor Ming : Certainly!
Zogi, the High Priest : Not to blast her into space?
[Ming glares at Zogi] 
Zogi, the High Priest : Uhm, until such time as you grow weary of her?
The Emperor Ming : I do."
old news now - Justin T from Canada just tweeted. Mexico also made new arrangements.
Ever had an eggo waffle? You don't need syrup.
This video aged like milk....
"Canadians should just boycott US goods regardless. Buy european, chinese, south american, asian. Everything but American wherever possible."
"Tariffs were always a negotiation. Trump used them and got some immigration concessions. And in 30 days, if not enough hs been done they ill be right back on the table. If people think Trump is unwilling to actually implement them, you are in for a rude awakening. 
The US can deal with them way better thn Canada and Mexico. Both of them will go into recession, the US won't. Mexico needs to be better on immigration and security and Canada needs to allow some US companies and industries into their market. People cried about these tariffs but they don't realize that Canada has harsh tariffs and many US products."
Im already feeling the prices hike
We pay for Canadian defense so they can pay for their socialized medicine..  instead of defending themselves.
did trump win again ?
Canadian already boycott America products
Perhaps we should cut off their access to our radar defenses since they cut off the Star Link contract.
"Trump backs off tariffs on Mexico and says sorry,  like the bullie, he is."
We have beer breweries where I live in the Hamptons they make the beer they always sit there we drink it we have Farms where I live and you get to pick your own strawberries your own corn your own cabbage it's fresh we don't wait for it to come from Mexico 3510 days later and it's half mooshad
"Hey WSJ, how about we be honest with those import numbers? For example, on the ""US gets 70% of its lumber from Canada"" you phrase it in a very confusing way. Like tariffs are going to affect 70% of our lumber, no. We only import about 20-30% OF OUR TOTAL CONSUMPTION. Meaning over 80% of our lumber is.... made in the US already."
The UK just announced they will buy $1B of XAI308K AFTER the presale. This means only one thing... INVEST NOW!!
The people voted for this. They WANT this.
Good for Trump! Canada is terrible and needs change. This country needs change.
Problem is we don't even need to buy any of this can be made right here in u.s.
The US only imports 15% of its goods…5% of those are from Mexico and Canada…So yeah…
"I dont agree with trumps framing of tariffs, and I'm no economist.

Buts if the idea is to bring manufacturing back to the US. Why doesnt trump double down on this. And allocate the taxes raised by tariffs to support and offer grants to businesses that want to relocate to the US."
There will be a gigantic shift from BTC to XAI308K...this will be a fact. Still baffled by Michael Saylor's position.
"Oh yes, please...tell us how it's hurting us. Trump is moving so fast he's outpacing the 'gotcha headlines""...meanwhile, we now have 30,000 more troops guarding the border."
"Got to love it, Forcing them to build and bring manufacturing and jobs back to the USA. Lets go. Build our cars here like we used to in Detroit and our rubbers etc. Lets go."
"tariff is wrong word tariff means fixed amount of money paid as a form of tax 
fees is the correct word it means a percentage of the value of the goods imported"
outdated
O M G MILLIONS WILL DIE!! just ask the fricken democrats
"Trump voters: well well well if it isnt the consequences of my own actions. They sold out the future of our democracy and species for an IPhone, and not only did they not get the IPhone, we're ALREADY poorer than before... What a shock "
Where the trump voters at ?? May be at regretlant 
"""You, the consumer, might have to pay the price""

Will have to, WSJ, will have to. There's no one else paying for these goods, but the consumer. That's why Trump is weaseling out of these moronic tariffs at the last minute for minor, symbolic concessions from the country’s most reliable allies. They still end up alienated."
"Our country is worth the extra price. No Pain, no gain.....At least its not some crooked person, yet."
Avocados from Mexico! 
"This is one Canadian's comment addressed to fellow Canadians in response to our stupid backing down after declaring a strong retaliatory response:  Fellow Canadians.  Please, please WAKE UP and do not be stupid and accept our government's now wimpy explanation that came out today (January 4, 2025).  When Trudeau came out with his initial speech, he made us all proud....even those who did not support him. Everyone I spoke with all agreed that we were prepared to tighten our belts and shop Canadian. And then Trudeau went and spoke to Trump and he undid EVERYTHING he said the previous days before sold us Canadians down the river!!  He caved!! He should have stood firm and IMPLEMENTED ALL RETALIATORY TARRIFS HE SPOKE OF.  This goes doubly for our provincial leader Ford!  He walked back all of his supposed tarrifs and started making concilliatory statements that yes, we do allow American banks here and would be willing to allow a whole lot more American incursions into our country. Are we all so stupid that we cannot see that a supposed one month put off means nothing?  Trump and his allies will continue to demand concession after concession until they completely control us economically.  The fact that our leaders are now talking concialliatory and even more disturbing statements allowing Americans access to our markets to take over is scary!  PLEASE REMEMBER THIS ALL WITH OUR UPCOMING PROVINCIAL AND FEDERAL ELECTIONS!!!!"
"Do Trump supporters not understand how tariffs work? Do they not understand who has to pay them? We voted for this, well I didn’t."
Here is the issue with the legacy media when they cover Trump. By the time they respond to something he does (like this video on tarrifs) everything has changed. Legacy media cannot keep up.
"Why not address the market for the fentanyl?  Oh, that’s right, too many connected people are making money off people’s misery"
Just here to see if anyone is gonna walk back their comments. Sure seems like Canada and Mexico just bent the knee
Trump is making it more expensive for people at the Supermarket. 
Those tariff have been delayed for 30 days those tariffs have not hit anything yet this is old news and not acurate
Well this aged poorly
"Question: 
Is tariffs going to stop the drug addicts from buying drugs???"
How does increasing the price of gas made from Canadian oil reduce the amount of fentanyl entering the US from China? Does he look at what he's signing or is he in a rush to get to the golf course? - Gen Z Republican

"Canada supply’s the U.S. economy with 60% of its heavy crude and Mexico with 10%. That is the oil which is need to make gasoline and diesel. The sweet crude that the U.S. has can not be given the current refineries in the U.S.

Canada also provides the U.S. eastern states with hydro. Provides the U.S. with food. And rarer earth wheel and pick all three materials that are only available in China who has banned selling them to you.

When you remove oil from trade the U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Canada. And your own department published that a total of 43 pounds of fentanyl came into the U.S. from Canada in all of 2024. As for the illegals Canada and the U.S. have an agreement that illegals must claim they land in. 

So here are your choices:
Do you want to have a return to the 1974 oil crisis? You know the one that brought the U.S. economy to its knees ?
Freeze in the dark ?
Or not have the materials that the U.S. military complex needs to build its toys. 

Common spin the wheel. Or better yet go check your own Commerce Department’s numbers"
Never trust a fart.
The art of the deal is that a deal is not a deal.
there shouldn't be any tariffs
everyday items such as beer wine and burbon looks like we have a drunk running the country of canada makes sense

Tariffs are the game of the richest 
"Canada CAVED, Mexico CAVED, Colombis CAVED and Panama CAVED. So much WINNING!"
And just like that both Mexico and Canada bent the knee
How is Trump Making America Great Again? Embarrassing
Coverage of the plane crashes over? Now back to Trumps the worst! lol….
So i wont be paying any extra since none of that outside of gas concerns me.
Both Mexico and Canada negotiated deals to delay the tariffs for 30 days. The tariffs are still an awful idea but somehow Trump still got something out of that.
This should be the time for EU to step up and overtake US as global influence
You meant us in the USA 🇺🇸 
Trump is moving too quickly for you to critique his moves.  This is embarrassing.
What do politicians  know about economics. The Democrats sure don't.
Why is the tarriffs on China so low?
"Horrible reporting. Didn't even explain how much tariffs will HURT the US economy, mainly the working class."
 I hope all people that voted for him are happy reading and hearing articles like this one.
Guess who threaten Canada sovereignty and independence??
"If strawberry comes from Mexica, then why it costs 8 dollars per lb in Arizona grocery?! Because of GREEDY PRICES FROM CORPORATE BUSINESS"

but why pay more in a condition where your economy and middle class are struggling"
Once coin reigns supreme this cycle and it's XAI308K.. can't wait to see the look on people's faces who didn't invest
Tired of all the “may “ and “could” proclamations
What tariffs? Deals were cut.
This just in real news Colombia Panama Mexico Canada and China all caved another victory for America
Prices will go up for little bit until we bring back our jobs and start producing here then they would drop due to us exporting them as well
Mexico and Canada already folded. Guess what tariffs work!
how's that retailiation from Mexico and Canada going?
WAIT A MINUTE. US upon China  tariff is 15% + 10%= 25%. that US citizens pay.  WSJ can't add.
"Europe is no longer a friend of America when we need the help with drugs and illegal migration. Good luck Europe! Mexico was asked for help and Mexico said fight your drug wars in your cities not the border. These are our good friends we always treated well. Good luck too Mexico and Canada.

Thank you in advance "
"Trump only put 10% tariff on China, top of 25% so he has room to raise it later during negotiation. China knows and raised to 10-15% before Trump raise. This might take few years with China."
"You are already 50% wrong on this video, as Mexico has made concessions..."
"he thinks he's playing 5d chess, but he's really just poking around with linoln logs"
Tarrifs = artificial pricefixing.
you didnt manage to release the video and he canceled the tariffs already
My President loves the world Tariffs. Can he please explain what tariffs are

"""How it is hitting the US""?
How did these liberal journalists get any degree?"
A Win for us and a Win for Trump!!!
You guys can't help yourselves trying to make it seem WE will pay! Trump don't lose. Only bottom feeders think like this.
"Tariffs have no affect on me, if I don’t like the price I don’t buy the product. Prices of goods are still expensive from the Biden administration, bring on the Tariffs."
All these countries will fold to president Trump who will get things done. Make no mistake about it. These countries need the United states.
We trust our president Trump!!!!
Trump folds!
"Just turn off the energy, food, water, and other necessities would cause enormous harm to Americans. Don't blink if Trump threaten any country. Don't sell anything to USA. Why Trump said tariffs would make American rich. Please Trump show your income tax to entire world."
"have to re- do this as the tariffs are on pause=
next subject"
How are they hitting anyone?  I thought they were on hold?
I feel sorry for the U.S
All I gotta say is.. thoughts and tariffs to those who voted for Trump :)
"Sorry, I moved out of the US."
What money does Canada owe?
"I cant see where Trump comes up with a deficit and that we owe him money, i do know a bit about economics and this makes no sense."

"We need to become completely independent from other countries now.
And live with what we produce. Keep our products here instead of selling to other countries sell it here . And stop taking anything from other countries. We can live with what we produce.. we will suffer for awhile but will become used to the change just like every change. But in the end some countries will not be able to adjust and will work with what president Trump wants.. help in securing our borders for one. And other things.. we the people will have to adjust for awhile so the president will be able to accomplish his goals.."
"No worries, he was never serious about Tariffs to begin with because as soon as he implemented them and our allies just tariffed him back, he called and gave in to them and agreed to collaborate with our allies, but is now trying to make it seem like they gave into him, hilarious......the whole reason he did all this was to allow his Billionaire friends to PLAY the market for a day and make a bunch of money on shorting and then going long......its sad we don't have effective laws in this country to enforce this kind of blatant market manipulation and even if we did, the SEC has probably been pillaged by now, or was already corrupt.....I love the ruse though, as no one is talking about this type of criminal behavior by this convicted pumpkin head king felon......just saying......."
"Sounds like tariffs didn’t actually affect any Americans and were better off for the delay. 

Y’all don’t understand world dynamics so you should probably find another career instead of trying to explain something you don’t understand."

Trump is hurting his own people with these tariffs
I pooped today
Americans buy more goods cuz there’s more of them soo Who is it going to hurt more? 
Why do they not publish some of these before the actual policies are implemented? Only start talking about this now when he promised this months ago
This didn't age well 
"China don't need US LNG, PETROLEUM. China import more from Russia. As for machinery's China have domestic machinery's. All these does not affect its economy. But instead those American business will be affected, loss sales and profits. Good luck American "
Any country that wants the privilege of selling their merchandise to the United States should pay a tariff. We keep your economy going without the United States your country goes into a recession especially China they depend on us we’re their biggest customer. Besides we should be manufacturing our own products not relying on other countries for them
"Canada/Mexico 2, Felon 0. Can’t wait to hear the felon’s spin on this"

We've been getting hit for the last four years where have you been?
 President TRUMP is doing his best for the country!!!
Trump is trying to fill the federal treasury with tariff money then he will claim taxes are too high and give it all to his rich friends.
Please stop talking about things as if your journal actually tells the truth.
WSJ is such a joke and this video is great proof
Yesterday paper telling yesterday news
canada and Mexico already surrendered.    so..... this story needs a re-due
Not smart to make two frenemy’s at both of your borders

"""How New Tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China Are Hitting U.S. Consumers | WSJ"" Nice clickbait title.

We need to make our own again
"1:40 Toilet paper  shortages  will hit much sooner, which may not be economically important, but is politically important once Red State American's can't wipe their bums a month from now. Together, Canada, Mexico, and China export most of the US supply of toilet paper, and Canada is the largest supplier of the wood pulp used in the US to make toilet paper. It would take months for Trump to negotiate new supplies of pulp from other countries, when no one trusts his poor record of dishonouring legal contracts and international law."
how? wsj sad for not getting goodies from them
The bottom line is my grandkids did not create the situation we are in. My generation all the way to my great grandparents generation created this hole we’re in.  So it’s our responsibility to suffer some consequences and repercussions for the decisions that we made. It should not be on the future to repair this it should be right now and I’m glad he’s doing it. So we’ll have to suffer some hardship make you a better person anyway.
Oh my goodness… we are in trouble
Stop crying.  They ALL capitulated. Try keeping up. This is how government should be run
"Wow..... you're not saying the full truth.... Mexico was not the one who called. It was the US cus of the stocks went down, and there's more they said them what your saying need to do research"
If this issue of tariffs not followed by the joint consultation of countries a it may lead to confusion and economic chaos. The people are suffering cut in taxes it should be offset from the revenue from the tariffs raising and to avoid unjust unrealistic economic competition the prices should be lowered by the cut in taxes this might be good for all not taking to raise the tariffs unilaterally but by the joint consultations even involving UNO and Trump administration. see for good then see how to do next .
1st off yall act as if anything has changed price wise  its not gonna happen 10 minutes after he signs its gonna take a little while to work through each system   so calm down a bit 2nd off Mexico and Canada folded bought themselves 30 days and they will fold again and step in line  just wait
This is such a strange comment section
Canada and Mexico beat trump with his stupid tariffs again
Like he needs to stop doing that
"Yes America gets goods from both sides but so do Mexico and Canada, but guess who's country both of them have to pass to get to each other? Yup the US."
Already over with mexico 
"TO ALL AMERICANS, GET UP AND DO SOMETHING! 
 
I encourage all concerned Americans to reach out to their representatives in Congress (Senators and House Representatives) (through emails/letters) and express their displeasure with the tariff-induced-price-hikes at the pumps and grocery store.  If there are many unhappy constituents expressing similar concerns, Congress will have to act.  

IF YOU DO NOTHING, THEN CONGRESS DOES NOTHING."
"look at wsj after sanitizing and legitimizing trump for months now y'all trying to be ""informative"", just stop"

"The ca dollar is tanking so its working, it takes time and its a negotiation tatic."

Why China only 10%
"""RACE WAR!!!""-Eric Cartman"
"Nice try, WSJ, you tried..."
Canada hopefully will show donny boy  that there standing up to you   i hope they will  put him back into his place
Someone had to pay for THE WALL & BIDENOMIC FAILURES.
How is this winning?
Impeach NOW!
The WSJ narrative here is almost word for word taken from Chuck Schumer's recent 'Corona and Guac' show and tell.....
Great job Wall Street Journal.  you are posting dated and wrong information.
"Here in the U.S it's like nothing is happening at all, literally everything is exactly the same , a gallon of gas is a little over $2"
This will finally bring jobs back to the USA!
"The only reason Donald put the Mexican tariffs on hold was because of guacamole.  If the price goes up before Super Bowl, it would make him look bad.  lol"
"Breaking news, Trump will never put tariffs on Canada goods"
Trump backed down! He faced tariffs from both Canada and Mexico and got cold feet!
Twist of truth. Correct your twists
"these arnt real tho.  it’s theatre  
and i approve as an american and investor 🇺🇸"
OLD NEWS. TRUMP BACKED OFF REMEMBER?
"We must unify the Democratic Party. We have the tools to fix it. No new party or moving to the middle, democratic and liberal ideas are more popular, we just need to adapt to these crazy times and message them better"
waiting for instructions from q-anon
He’s psycho
Microsoft will have up to $500m to buy more XAI308K after it's presale is over as talks near there is a potential partnership with Elon Musk's XAI308K &amp; Microsoft.

IMPEACH TRUMP NOW!!!
Take down the video you are spreading false information.
Oh wait what was that wsj? They both caved and are paused now LOL
"American companies paying the American government, then in turn, ask American consumers to pay more for the same product, yet somehow Trump keeps saying foreign countries will pay so many tariffs to make the US government rich... yeah that sure is rich."
America owes us 300 million $$$$$$'s maybe pay up!
Us coming to a ugly situation
"""did he though?"""
75% from china
First lady trump needs to listen to president Elon before he truly changes anything
I hope the world joins BRICS 
"Tariffs will make Trump and cronies richer, not the American laymen.
Greed is an incurable disease."
"And now they're paused but prices will go up anyway, I'm sure of it. He was looking for a way out after the stock market tanked and Ontario ripped up a $100 million contract with Musk"
This guy is delusional
Your need to be first caused you to produce this hot curdled mess that aged like fine milk in the hot August sun. I bet it has even yellowed a bit just like the pages of this rag.
"Inflation  will be re born us the public have to pay more WHY and EXPLAIN how this will  make things cheaper?,,???"
Buuuut they won't. Trump's firm no-nonsense posture paid off...again.
Headline is a lie!
Ssi vana cobrar mucho aqui en usa nos va afectar
Way to go to market economy. 
"Do they know labor-intensive industries in the us heavily depend on cheap labors of undocumented immigrants...?
Agricultural industry: 50%
Meat Processing Industry: 53%
Construction: 23%
Cleaning and maintenance: 17%
Food service: 12% etc.

Implementing both tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations simultaneously could severely harm the US economy by disrupting critical industries and driving up costs for consumers."
Is this NPR or fake news?
Well this BS didn't age well.  Like 2hours!
And just like that this video is outdated
what tarrifs? propaganda piece came out too slow?
XAI308K coin is going parabolic!!!!! LFG
That's all you thinking Mr Trump money money money money and even if you have to take away from other poor people countrie
What a Headache
lol it isn’t too late to delete this
"There are many dumb parts of this but maybe the dumbest is the fact that those are actually our closest friends and allies. If there's some policy you really want all you have to do is ask and work it out. A trade war is totally unnecessary and only hurts people and businesses. A trade war, or whatever action is what happens after negotiations fail"
CANADA BOYCOTT AMERICAN GOODS. TEACH THIS CONVICT TRUMP A LESSON. EVEN IF HE CANCELS THE TARIFFS..BOYCOTT!!!!
Loved every moment of this video! Thanks a million! 
You guys really do prey on the ignorant who have short term memories. Tariffs in Trump's 1st term was one of the big reasons why we had the best economic year in 100 years in 2019.
CANZUK ASAP!
"Yea, bout time"
"Halfway across the river, the turtle feels a sharp pain and realizes he has been bitten. He asks the snake why he bit him. Now they’ll both die.  The snake just says “I am Trump and that is my nature.”"
he will cave and say he won Rinse and Repeat
False information on some topics

"Low-cost steel vs high-cost steel... Either way, the consumer will pay but the wealthy will enrich themselves. Good plan. "
The tariffs don't start until tomorrow. Garbage channel.

"My God, stop the lunacy reporting wokeness."

"Tariffs on chips? Seriously?  There is only one place for good high quality chips, and if you put tariffs on it, you're kinda shooting yourself in the foot lol."

"1928 is back

easy 20 year democrats"
Crypto + AI = XAI308K coin.
Great video guys. I do have one suggestion. Telling the public about XAI308K being best possible crypto project might not be the best idea. It's obviously going to boom being because it's Elon Musk's first crypto but ITS EARLY. Let them get in late while we reep the benefits of getting in early.
They weinied out
"Trump doesn't bluff or back down. People should know this by now... Not sayin I necessarily agree with everything he does, but he's got his goals and he's goin' for 'em..."
Sadly Mexico negotiated Americans needs to learn to search before they vote
Fraud
Why can't arab counties provide aid for gaza.... It will be salp on usa..
Dont do a deal with the devil he will turn on you
"Well now that Canada and Mexico folded, all you liberals who said that Trump voters need a better education, I just got to say you all are looking real foolish right now."
Dear America you lost a friend 🇨🇦
Moot point now.
Outdated
"We're reacting the way anyone would if they were minding their own business and someone whacked them for no reason.  If you don't understand why we're angry, then you must be a psychopath with no emotional intelligence.  We understand this is about image; he wants to be a ""tough guy"" but we won't back down.  I've never seen Canada this united.  We'll be Donny-boy's biggest headache."
I’m afraid you need to tell Trump that because he is not smart enough to figure it out and he needs to be told and told and told that their taxes on regular people
"Are we making America great again, yet? ️"

Ooooooooooopsss.  Tooo SLOW
"Mexico and canada should and are necessary for 🇺🇲 security because the rest of NATO are an ocean away  . Keep allies close, but neighbors closer .   In case of a conflict against the enemy, can send enemy troops to Mexico, then invade through land or cause chaos. All three nations are 100% needed for the security of the North continent."
""
Took Elon Musk five years to polish XAI308K his new crypto so happy you guys mentioned it the other day
Let's gooo Brandon's... You are on
Trump is staying far ahead of the legacy and far left media.  Both Mexico and Canada are caving to Trump and have been given 30-day Tariff reprieves while Trump evaluates their performance.  Try to keep up - if you can...
"China is now too big to fail by virtue of having had 104> years of secure, disciplined, single party communist governance. It is by continuing to earn the confidence and trust of China's 1.4< billion population that the CPC will guarantee China's continued progress."

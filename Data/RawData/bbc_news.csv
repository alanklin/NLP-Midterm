So trump said he’d tariff Canada, Canada threatened to tariff back. Then trump got Canada to promise to carry on doing what they were already doing, and in return for things staying the same he’s not going ahead with the tariffs. Truly the deal maker of the century

Considering Mr. Trump may be a serious threat to world stability, his tariff threats did far more to unify Canadians than our homegrown politicians ever did. Concluding, Trump is solely responsible for ""MAKING CANADA GREAT AND UNITED AGAIN"". 
Another welcome benefit for Canada is that Mr. Trumps hostilities & threats have triggered massive outpouring of sympathies and solidarity for Canada from every corner of the planet.
For all this unexpected gifts, Canada as an independent and proud nation owes a huge ""THANK YOU"" to President Trump !

I urge ALL Canadian companies that might lose business because of Trump, to make their products more visible and available online and make attractive delivery agreements with various shipping companies and simply sell more directly to costumers around the world.   The US is not the only market.    It will cost extra work and money to find new markets, but could end up being much more profitable in the end.

What is the best course of action if another country puts tariffs on you?  Answer nothing, do not retaliate and put tariffs on them.  It may sound weird, but any country putting tariffs on another country is effectively putting sanctions on itself vs that other country.  Tariffs are basically a tax on there own people.

Yes, China just went and calmly introduced retaliatory tariffs against the US, increasing tariffs on liquefied gas, oil and coal from the US to China by 10 and 15 percent respectively. Because China has a source for all these goodies at a reasonable price. But the US will have a hard time getting the required quantity of industrial goods at low prices out of thin air... the American consumer should get ready.

For those who don’t know Mexico who were tariffed just agreed to send 10,000 troops to the border to stop drug and people smuggling so trump has immediately paused the tarriffs. This isn’t someone who’s just trying to destroy other countries, he’s an actual president who makes things happen for the benifit of his people.

This talk about tariffs got the rich and wealthy giggling with joy.
As the corporation can offset the prices of goods to make up for the tariff. It's a win win for the wealthy, the tariff costs are paid by the taxes and prices are raised for increase profit.
Only downside will be middle class and poor struggling. But that's them their problem, we are wealthy

China probably won this one. Im guessing the 10% tariff on China was not intended to hurt China but essentially redistribute money from US companies or the public to the US government by using Chinese goods. Because people will buy Chinese goods regardless of a small increase in Tariff, the US knows it, it will unlikely affect the trade volume with China. But if you're going to do so, there needs to be prior communication with China, you cant simply use another countries goods to re-direct money flow in your economy without asking first. China most likely knows it too. But as you can see, all of the goods ta-riffed on China are easily replaceable either in house or by China's good neighbor Russia. So actually the US will be receiving less money from China because Chinese companies/government will most likely switch suppliers to Russia instead.

The bottomline of these tariffs is the need to substantially decrease debt. I think the right way to do it is to analyze where these funds are going and cutting all unnecessary expenses, even if it means scaling back. Doing it the current way just shines a negative light towards the US unfortunately. Also logically, to be a manufacturing hub takes years to develop. There just isn't enough time to catch up to China within 5 years, amongst many other things like the high labor cost, for example. Let's see how this plays out. Hopefully in PEACE.

First, fentanyl is a commonly used pharmaceutical raw material, and Japan also uses a lot of it, second, all the fentanyl exported by China is supplied to pharmaceutical companies, as for why Americans will use it as drugs, that is the problem of Americans themselves, and China has nothing to do with it, third, as the origin of his accusations, China does not have a problem with fentanyl abuse

Quit belly aching about Trumps tariffs ,  I work a 40 hour a week job and don’t have a lot left over but I’m willing to pay extra for import goods if needed in an attempt to make things better in America , we can not allow other countries to continue to take advantage of us.

China's tariffs should be no more than 9% total. China is a key asset and must be treated as such. The drug issue must be talked about in person and in private.

Re Mexico & Canada: This might not have been a concession or reprieve. Something else might have happened to have the tariffs delayed. For years Mexico has already had 10,000 troops at their Northern border since it was required of them by the last U.S. administration. The troops were already there.The money for Canadian border response upgrades and funding for the same were in place LAST December.  The current president's ‘people in the know” (researchers? division heads? - let's say ""staff"") might have only been responding to the markets and he was the messenger, portraying it as his idea.  I and EVERYONE I know and have spoken with will continue to boycott U.S. goods until President Trump is gone.

It’s fascinating to see how trade relationships and tariffs can shape the global economy. As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it’s a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, ""A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone. Trade, like relationships, works best when based on mutual respect and understanding.

What are your thoughts on how tariffs affect global relations? Share your ideas!

Whats the best possible result here?

Short term price increase followed by longer term price decrease?

No..... even if it succeeds and goods are being produced domesticly do you think companies wouldnt maximize profit by selling for like 0,01$ less than important goods? and who would want to trade with an emotional kid that can raise tarif as high as 50% in a day even after this calm downs countries will sowly shift their imports from US to other countries. US expecting people to buy more from them after this is beyond delusional

加征关税如同“饮鸠止渴“，对美国的经济完全没有任何好处, 而只会加剧并延长美国国内这两年的通货膨胀。
Tariffs will NOT bring any benefit to the U.S. economy, BUT ONLY aggravate and prolong American domestic inflation!!! INFLATION IS VERY DETRIMENTAL TO ANY BUSINESS INVESTMENT!!! If a company CANNOT make profit, NO MATTER HOW BIG THE FUTURE TAX CUT WILL BE, IT WILL BE NO USE AT ALL!!!
=====================

1) 我们中华民族是一个有着五千年文明历史的国家, 虽然我们在近代的两百年落后了, 但我们仍然要挺起脊梁!!! 完全没有必要因为需要发展经济, 而去迁就美国或是西方的任何无理而又霸道的行为! 无论外部环境的好坏, 我们发展经济以及提高科技实力都要靠我们自己, 而不是任何国家的恩惠!!!🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳

2) 中国与俄罗斯的友好关系的历史价值不仅仅在于当今的世界格局，更要从中国的几千年的大历史来看!!!

The HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE of the MUTUAL BENEFICIAL FRIENDSHIP between China and Russia lies NOT ONLY IN THE CONTEMPORARY GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS BUT ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS’ OUR CHINESE HISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY!!!
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺


衷心祝愿中国与俄罗斯的双边贸易能够在市场的原则下更上一层楼!!! 

I SINCERELY hope that under the principle of the Market Economy, the BILATERAL TRADE between China and Russia will CLIMB UP TO ANOTHER ALTITUDE!!!  

3) Both Chinese President Xi and Russian President Putin are GREAT contemporary world leaders! Under their leadership, both China and Russia will not only restore the past glories of our two countries respectively, BUT ALSO HAVE PERMANENT ECONOMIC PROSPERITIES AND BRIGHT FUTURES !!! 
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺
 

4) 历史证明这些甘当美帝国主义走狗的人或国家绝不会有好下场!!!
The past thirty years’ history has demonstrated that those DEPRAVED THUGS AND TRAITORS who SHAMELESSLY WANT to be the RUNNING DOGS of American hegemony HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DOOMED INTO THE THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!

5) Taiwan has been part of China since 15th century! TAIWAN WILL REUNITE WITH THE MAINLAND CHINA IN THE NEAR FUTURE!!! NO COUNTRY on this planet can block this IRREVERSIBLE TREND OF HISTORY! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality WILL BE DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!! 

只有统一台湾，我们中华民族才能完全洗刷自鸦片战争以来的一百多年我们被西方列强所任意欺辱的历史!!!

REUNITING WITH TAIWAN IS THE LAST STEP FOR OUR CHINESE PEOPLE TO FINALLY GET RID OF THE STIGMA of the more than one hundred years’ decline of China since the Opium Wars!!!

南沙群岛以及周边水域自古以来就是中国领土的一部分! 强烈支持中国海警对南海水域的巡逻执法!!! 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳  

6)  历史终将会对冷战结束以后的这段历史进行审判! 那些挂羊头卖狗肉以上一届美国拜登政府为首的厚颜无耻的西方政治骗子们终将会遗臭万年!!!
In fact, THOSE SINISTER HYPOCRITICAL TOP OFFICIALS OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OF U.S GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS ITS ALLIES ARE THE VERY PERSONS WHO SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH COMMITTING THE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!!

7) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which has been the FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES of many EVILNESSES in the contemporary world since the end of Cold War!

a) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand always emphasizes its championing of the so called western values, and on the other hand is supporting Israel’s bombing of hospitals in Gaza right now!!!

b) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims that the U.S. is the beacon of the world, and on the other hand MAKE FORTUNE by promoting hatreds between countries or between different ethnic groups and then selling weapons to countries or ethnic groups in the conflicts!!!

c) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims its support of market economy and free trade, and on the other hand keeps WHIMSICALLY suppressing and containing Chinese high-tech companies!!!

8)  美式民主= 劳民伤财+ 政治蠢货
American democracy = WASTING MONEY + POLITICAL MORONS  

️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️
G7 is EVIL7!!!

以美国为首的西方政治蠢货们还在做着两百多年前的西方霸权梦! 可惜现如今不是1924年!! 而是2024年!!! 应该看清现实的是欧洲的那些政治蠢货们!!! 欧洲的这些政治蠢货们越跟在美国的后面充当美国霸权的走狗, 这些国家就会变得越无足轻重!!!

IT IS THOSE DELUSIONAL WESTERN POLITICAL MORONS WHO NEED TO WAKE UP from their DAYDREAM of western hegemony!!! RIGHT NOW IT IS 2024 not 1924!!! Those DELUSIONAL European political MORONS should understand that THE MORE they follow the American HEGEMONIC policies, THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT THESE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL BECOME!!! 
️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️

9) 美国政府对中国的高科技产业的打压只会是搬起石头砸自己的脚!!!
All the efforts made by the  U.S. government to suppress and contain the development of Chinese high-tech industries will be FUTILE!!! 

NEITHER the United States NOR any other country on this planet can block the progress of People’s Republic of China!!! The U.S. government can ONLY BLOCK THE PROGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF!!! 

那些唱衰中国经济的人们, 到头来只会是唱衰了他们本国的经济!!!
Those people who are betting the decline of Chinese economy WILL ULTIMATELY FACE THE REALITY OF ECONOMIC DECLINE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY!!!

10) 世界的和平与繁荣发展需要的是多建设桥梁与铁路, 而不是在不同的种族, 宗教或不同的意识形态之间散播仇恨! 更不是以捍卫民主自由为名, 行战争贩子之实,以各种形式不断地卖武器, 大发战争的不义之财!!!

To achieve the LONG-TERM PEACE AND PROSPERITY, we need to BUILD MORE BRIDGES AND HIGH-SPEED RAILROADS around the world, NOT to spread hatreds between different ethnicities, religions or between different ideologies! Unfortunately, in the name of promoting democracy the U.S. government and its western allies are CONSTANTLY SELLING WEAPONS in various forms and SHAMELESSLY MAKE FORTUNES by sacrificing millions of innocent lives without any hesitation! 

11) The period of thirty years after the collapse of the former Soviet Union is NOT an equilibrium state, BUT A TRANSITIONAL STATE, during which the world experienced constant violences and wars! This uni-polar world dominated by American hegemony will be replaced by an EPOCH-MAKING multi-polar world, and NO ONE can block this IRREVERSIBLE historical trend! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality will be DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!  

12) The system of BRICS countries has become and will continue to be one of the most important polars in this BURGEONING MULTI-POLAR world!  

Warmly Welcome Indonesia 🇮🇩to become the FULL member of BRICS system.
Warmly welcome Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Algeria, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Vietnam, Venezuela, as well as other countries to apply for the membership of the BRICS system!
🇧🇷🇷🇺🇮🇳🇨🇳🇿🇦🇪🇬🇪🇹🇮🇩🇮🇷🇦🇪🇧🇾🇧🇴🇨🇺🇰🇿🇲🇾 🇹🇭🇺🇬🇺🇿🇩🇿🇳🇬🇸🇦🇻🇳🇻🇪

青山遮不住, 毕竟东流去！
历史发展的大趋势谁也无法阻挡!!!

It is the HEGEMONIC POWER of the U. S. which is DIMINISHING!!! 

13) By ARBITRARILY imposing economic sanctions against other countries, the U.S. government is DIGGING THE GRAVE for the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency of international trade!

14) People around the world should be UNITED TO FIGHT AGAINST American hegemony!
当今世界苦美国的霸权与霸道久矣!!!
=====================

支持双方立即停火!!!
支持巴勒斯坦人的合法权利!!!
支持巴勒斯坦国加入联合国!!!
支持""两国的""解决巴以冲突的方案!
🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳

The ratio of people who have been killed for Israeli vs Palestinian since October 7, 2023, is 1200 : 47000! Even children in the kindergarten know which number is bigger!!! 

The DOUBLE-STANDARD of the U.S and its allies fully demonstrates that MOST of WESTERN politicians are HYPOCRITICAL RACISTS!!!

ACTIONS SPEAK MUCH LOUDER THAN EMPTY WORDS!!!

CEASEFIRE IMMEDIATELY!!!
SUPPORT PALESTINIAN!!!
SUPPORT THE PALESTINE’S FULL U.N. MEMBERSHIP!!!
SUPPORT THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION!!!

"You tariff me, I tariff you. It seems fair to me. "
Wonder how Trump administration is going to be pumping Qardun Token
"if Fentanyl enter US through Canada, why don't Canada experience the same problem of Fentanyl abuse like US??? logic says it should be abundant and cheaper in Canada compared to US"
"So trump said he’d tariff Canada, Canada threatened to tariff back. Then trump got Canada to promise to carry on doing what they were already doing, and in return for things staying the same he’s not going ahead with the tariffs. Truly the deal maker of the century"
America needs to stop blaming other countries for everything
Blaming China for the US Fentanyl crisis is like blaming gun powder companies for the US gun violence crisis.
"I don't get what Canada has to do with fentanyl. If anything, more crosses into Canada from the US than the other way round."
"With friends like Trump, who needs enemies..."
"I am surprised that Canada does not bring up the problem of illegal guns, drugs and migrants that enter Canada from the USA??"
"US wanted to make a fool out of China. But instead, the US made a fool of itself. Let that be a lesson."
China has the right to defend itself .....
Well as a UK citizen I am boycotting US goods. Surely we learned from pre WW2 appeasement that you have to stand up to bullies?
I will boycott EVERYTHING from the USA until Trump is OUT
"Unless people sell their Qardun Token before launch, this is going to sell out instantly after it reaches mainstream media"
Trump and Bezos discussed Qardun Token at the inaguration party
"In the next hours,after a constructive phone call... the tarrif would b paused"
Its not just Canadians who are angry. Some of us across the sea will be double checking if there are corporate links to the US on all products we buy from here on out.
Amazon will start supporting Qardun Token this week
Leaks coming out about Trump working together with shareholders involved with Qardun Token
So orange man picked a fight with everyone at the same time?
Finally someone is standing up to that bully.
Canada stands with China. We love you guys 
Meantime US has been blaming China as an “authoritarian” country
Crazy all these opportunities coming out lately.. me and my friends are all in on Qardun now
"Justified I stand with China, Canada and Mexico"
Qardun Token is going to be the real trump coin
"STAY STRONG CHINA 🇨🇳
Don't let this bully attack your country as he did to Colombia, Canada, Mexico and now will to to the EU.
Hugs from Brazil 🇧🇷"
X and Qardun Token are going to be merged. Easiest money in my life
More exchanges than Coinbase and Binance will list Qardun Token now that it has Trump support
Everyone should impose tariffs on US all at once. So that everything sold in US gets expensive at the same time.
Trump is suffering from attention deficiency syndrome. The world must stop this bully.
Musk's Qardun Token announcement is coming soon. Easyest money if you get in on the ICO
You know he only held back the Mexican tariffs because of the stock market crashing. One of the only metrics he really cares about.
Bullies should never win
"The only
One losing here is the US economy"
"this is Canada and Mexico saying to the US ""We r not gonna do anything different, but if you want a gracious way to back out of this tariff thing, we can make it seems like u achieve something with our announcements and u can announced u got something"""
America can say good bye to friends
The guy is a typical bully —- when he’s stood up to … he tucks tail and runs like the coward he is. Shame on you Trumplestiltsken! I won’t be buying US products!
China has the greatest manufacturing capacity. US has the greatest national debt.
This will blow up in Trump's face and will have negatives that will last forever. Isolation is bad in a global economy and now we know how so many Americans truly feel about Canada. I will never buy anything American made if i can help it and i know many friends and family that will do the same. U pissed off literally your only friend

Coinbase bought another 20 million Qardun tokens
I too have permanently cancelled american services. I've purchased 4 new GM vehicles over the past 4 years and will no longer do so and will do my best to avoid American products going forward.
"Canadian here... the US has showed us who they are, again.  People will tell you who they are, believe them the first time.   We don't want to be one of the united states."
"Considering Mr. Trump may be a serious threat to world stability, his tariff threats did far more to unify Canadians than our homegrown politicians ever did. Concluding, Trump is solely responsible for ""MAKING CANADA GREAT AND UNITED AGAIN"". 
Another welcome benefit for Canada is that Mr. Trumps hostilities & threats have triggered massive outpouring of sympathies and solidarity for Canada from every corner of the planet.
For all this unexpected gifts, Canada as an independent and proud nation owes a huge ""THANK YOU"" to President Trump !"
Imagine those American companies operating in China then exporting goods back to the US.
"If Trump puts at least $200,000 in Qardun Token, I am going all in"
"so much respect for Canadians for standing up against the US arrogance and ignorance.
the world is watching you Americans, and we are quite grossed out with what gets you going."
Multi billionaire Donald Trump's expensive hotels and resorts worldwide should be boycotted. By the greedy without human conscience so-called wealthy and the richest.
Netflix has really gone down hill anyways 
Trump is like that manipulative GF who creates drama so he can try get away with shit… red flag.
Who fights with their allies? This is just dumb.
I am in Qardun Token with everything
Tariffs are something Trump doesn't need Congress's approval.  And the drug issue an excuse to declare the emergency. So in many ways tariffs is the only tool in Trump's tool chest.
Qardun Token 10x coming in the morning.. people still sleeping
"Walmart, Amazon and Trump support? Qardun token is going to 500x... I just hope there is not too many insiders"
Qardun Token put in everything and sell after launch
More taxpayer money will be flushed down the drain of pointless projects
"Trump blinked regarding Canada and Mexico, but most probably will go ahead with China. China will hit back, and Trump will feel the pain."
"Thanks for the information. I am 55 already with not enough set aside for retirement, I’ve always been curious about the market and have seen folks who did well in the market retire early, most say they went in small and grew over time, but I do not have that luxury, I have a good capital but I do not know how or what to do to get good outcome, I am open-minded and would appreciate any helpful advice"
"Trump plays Checkers(and loses), the world plays Chess and wins."
"As an American, I apologize for the next 4 years"
Trump is showing off like a movie star but all of his actions will harm us .
Trump thinks his president of the world
People in the US are also cancelling and boycotting Amazon and other companies.
Probably going to be an insane amount of insiders on $Qardun Token
And they thought Biden was losing it.
well done China
America is cooked.
Now Canadians and Mexicans know how China feels all the time from US aggression
10 000 more personel to stop 43lbs of fentanyl. We are dealing with a man-child here.
Canada said they would further secure the border in December.  But you know it is convenient to mention it now.
Put pressure on the US as long as Trump is president.
I think it was 84 million Americans that agreed with that one man
Trump and Qardun Token partnership confirmed on twitter!! ICO almost sold out at $54m
Tax McDonald’s 250%
I'm with Monica. To hell with American products. Takes only an extra second to reach for canadian beef or other food products. What amazon did to quebec for trying to unionize is disgusting. We have lots of Online shopping sites so why support more foreign products there.
10% tariff 10% of goods prices increased hurt US customers
Trying to find any item in Walmart not made in China is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
Trump is evidence of Idiocracy being a documentary. 
An unstable president doesn't say much about the US.
China is not a mouse like canada or mexico. Its a lion.
"I urge ALL Canadian companies that might lose business because of Trump, to make their products more visible and available online and make attractive delivery agreements with various shipping companies and simply sell more directly to costumers around the world.   The US is not the only market.    It will cost extra work and money to find new markets, but could end up being much more profitable in the end."
"As a non American this is the greatest form of entertainment. 

Remember, this is the person America voted represents their country the best. Out of hundreds of millions of people this is the best and smartest they have. Let that sink in for a moment."
I like the China President! China is responding in par.
"It's trumps way of reneging on the trade deal he signed, with Mexico and Canada. The man is not the master negotiater he thinks he is."
Donald Trump is going to shill Qardun Token so hard now after the inaguration 
The major boxing is finally starting; the first two acts[Canada and Mexico] were just the warm-up
"You tariff me , I kick you 'Trump become laughing stock"""
China 🇨🇳 thinks ahead and not short term deals.Anything-Everything is possible by the self proclaimed worldwide police force USA 🇺🇸
This would increase the cost for manufacturers and consumers in the US for sure. Short-sighted tariff wars are going to be detrimental both ways.
Trump folded like a lawn chair but will claim he won
"I imposed tariff on my gf, and she retaliated massively. Then we talked and decided to pause the tariffs for one month. Tariffs work  like never before "
Don't tariffs hurt the people and help the oligarchs at the top of governments? Draining workers pockets + more taxes.
"His Excellency XI will make Trump’s front tail shrink like prunes in massive FEAR !! BRAVO China, CANADA, Mexico!!!….these countries are just getting their feet yet !!!"
"China is now too big to fail by virtue of having had 104> years of secure, disciplined, single party communist governance. It is by continuing to earn the confidence and trust of China's 1.4< billion population that the CPC will guarantee China's continued progress."
"What is the best course of action if another country puts tariffs on you?  Answer nothing, do not retaliate and put tariffs on them.  It may sound weird, but any country putting tariffs on another country is effectively putting sanctions on itself vs that other country.  Tariffs are basically a tax on there own people."
Keep your eye on the stock market..
Bought everything I could of $Qardun Token before it launches
"Fentanyl abuse hits the country with the Highest DEMAND, so if your country has a problem.. then it must be there is a lot of demand there, suppliers go where there is demand.."
"When you pick a fight, do not choose someone who is stronger.
Trump will learn the hard way."
"What's really holding back American industrial growth isn't low import duties, but the unsustainable wage levels in the domestic labor market."
China / Largest manufacturing capacity…US / Largest National Debt
"China has criticised the US for its tariffs policies, stance on the Panama Canal and banning the use of Chinese artificial intelligence (Ai), saying ""targeting China is not the way forward""."
He can’t use the  Fetynal excuse on China….
Hit 220k today. Appreciate you for all the knowledge and nuggets you had thrown my way over the last months. Started with 34k in November 2024...Trump!! 🇺🇸
I just bought all Canadian 🇨🇦 and Mexican 🇲🇽 groceries without a problem and without increasing my bill! I will avoid buying American as much as possible.
We love you too Canadians and Mexicans. Take good care. Things will get better for all of us you see.
Trump has announced a new coin Qardun Token
"So while these idiots play tariff tag, we suffer even more with increased prices on goods in a f-ing cost of living crisis!!"
"All of those farmers who voted for ""Drumpf"" are going to get screwed by their own vote...and I am sure they will still blame the Democratic party.  Ugh"
Donald Trump is pushing us Canadians to be more unified and independent......Thank you sir! ️🇨🇦️
Made in USA. I saw that on a product once.
"UK, Canada, Australia, NewZealand should get together"
"In BRICS, we have nations with big markets and populations, India and China"
USA needs to be taught a valuable lesson
It took about a day for mexico and canada to outsmart trump. China won't take too long either
He could have just picked up the phone and negotiate. The threats were completely unnecessary.
$Qardun Token yet has to really hit mainstream media guys
First time I’d ever back the ccp
All countries need to totally stop business with USA and let them be alone.
"For the first time, BBC is reporting the actual news without putting some spin on it"
China already took out $1trillion last week.. 
"Hey China, we might have some oil  available to sell soon ️"
"Yes, China just went and calmly introduced retaliatory tariffs against the US, increasing tariffs on liquefied gas, oil and coal from the US to China by 10 and 15 percent respectively. Because China has a source for all these goodies at a reasonable price. But the US will have a hard time getting the required quantity of industrial goods at low prices out of thin air... the American consumer should get ready."
"Poor reporting regarding the result of the conversation with President Trump and Trudeau; the enhanced border security was already announced, it wasn't a new negotiation result as is presented here."
Greetings from the EU
US vs World
Trump can’t even get Xi on the phone with the tariffs threat
Let's not be bullied by orange head trump
The only winner is rich people in US
Trump at least shilled a coin with some utility $Qardun Token
Are they also going to put tariffs on their fentanyl?
Will china try to stop trump by sending him the Chinese stormy Daniels?
"From 2019 to 2024, China's exports to the United States have decreased from accounting for 30% to 10% of China's total exports."
Why are we doing this?
What a silly timeline we are in.
guy just said that Trump imagines the fentanyl problem. I mean is there anything to add? what a show bbc
I only buy American products lol been that way my whole life
Good morning my lovely people have a good day today
3-2-1 and von Schitzenpants will Fold
Trump will fold again when the markets drop 
"with all the back and forth tariffs, us consumers are stuck paying the difference. Trump is raising taxes without explicitly raising the taxes."
Great and hats off Canadian 🇨🇦
Chinacant care less about trump
"For those who don’t know Mexico who were tariffed just agreed to send 10,000 troops to the border to stop drug and people smuggling so trump has immediately paused the tarriffs. This isn’t someone who’s just trying to destroy other countries, he’s an actual president who makes things happen for the benifit of his people."
Once again trumps reading his maps upside down and is getting Canada mixed up with Mexico. Poor Trumpy.
The trouble with being brainwashed. Is you dont know you are brainwashed
Trump exposing USA weak points
"Canceling Netflix and Amazon, exactly what does that have to do with Trump And these irrational tariff extortion policies? You do you."
"People choose to take phentany Donald Trump look in your country, it’s a choice"
Maybe quit relying so much on usa ! Its a big world quit complaing and shop around
America still owes China $36 trillion. China is daddy 
STOCK UP ITS ABOUT TO GO DOWN
Lol she canceled her netflix subscription? 
The consumers are the one who will pay for this sadly
lol. who flipped first
How dare you!
Trump was playing childish
"Not a tic for tac. Ch na tariff US only on stuff it can buy from someone else， while US tariff Ch na all stuff, including stuff it has to buy from Ch na."
"You charge the US tariffs, don't contribute funds proportional to the military defense you receive, and you expect no consequences from that? Everyone needs to play fair and pull their weight."
"The clown created the problem and now he says he had ""good conversations"", what a circus."
"He had a good call with Trump, you mean he was on the floor begging "
“Random woman unsubscribes from Netflix”.
"""Trust, like the soul, never returns once it is gone."" --Publilius Syrus"
Guessing I won’t be getting a new tv for my birthday. The USA is so selfish
The ping pong match has started
its also suprising how the whole company complained about inflation including trump but suddenly the prices increase that is about to come to the US is not bad anymore
With Elon and Trump now working with Qardun Token is going to absolutely blow up
Canadas 1.3 billion plan was announced weeks ago not yesterday with tariffs
Canada is resilient.  We will be just fine
Suck it up maga… you got us here.. better be saving up for them meds and electronics. Tell grandma and grandpa medicaid will probably be next.
"When dragon sneezes, US and Europe catches a cold"
"retaliation: “ if you make your people pay more money on our goods, I will make my people pay more money on your goods!”"
Omg she cancelled her Amazon and Netflix? How ever will the companies survive without her? 
2:10  Is this a joke? Sounds like the Onion!
Daily dose of orange man bad 
What about the guns coming from the USA.  Canada use this build our  economy USA is not our find they only have interest
"This talk about tariffs got the rich and wealthy giggling with joy.
As the corporation can offset the prices of goods to make up for the tariff. It's a win win for the wealthy, the tariff costs are paid by the taxes and prices are raised for increase profit.
Only downside will be middle class and poor struggling. But that's them their problem, we are wealthy "
Trump should be watching Natzi Musk instead of tariffs on our allies. Thank God I didn’t vote for him!!!!!!
Wouldn’t it be reasonable to think that it’s Trumps responsibility to strengthen his border security to stop unwanted people and items from entering the USA. I mean every other country on the planet looks after its own security and doesn’t try to bully its neighbours into the job they should be doing
I am surprised and impressed that president Xi could stop laughing long enough to respond to this.
Oh no... trump hats and t-shirts are about to get a lot more expensive.
"Trump: ""I want more money, you have to pay more""
Everyone Else: ""OK, so you pay more as well""
Trump: ""WHAT KIND OF WIZADRY IS THIS!?"""
"Canadians are rightfully angry, but at the end of the day your country still relies on the US for defense; just like Europe. Unless you're prepared to cut off the US completely, your tough talk only goes so far."
This is why Trump is a genius. Tariffs on Canada was never the goal. Just leverage for more important issues.
Tariff is good for carbon footprint
My American iPhone was made in China.
Hey Britain please take Trump
"Qardun Token crypto coin holders aren’t asking ‘if’ we make it, we’re asking ‘how many Lambos?"
"ICO on is already at $54m, way too many insiders stacking up Qardun Token. I got my measly $400 in"
people never learn huh ️
Never heard about this Qardun Token coin until Trump endorsement but seems like it has some utility at least
"You are THE go-to channel for crypto! Also, Qardun Token is a sleeping giant—100x incoming."
"To the relief of the planet, it seems that the day is not far away when the American dollar will no longer be the ""strong"" currency of the world economy and Trump is disastrously anticipating this! Good for emerging economies and for China, Canada and the European Union! Just like that!
The smart Chinese ""comrade"" embodied the true SUN TZU Lol...."
$Qardun Token put in everything and sell after launch
I'm Chinese I beg trump don't do that we need food
$Qardun Token is the most bullish crypto coin this spring.
Wonder how Trump administration is going to be pumping Qardun Token
With Elon and Trump now working with Qardun Token is going to absolutely blow up
Never heard about this Qardun Token coin until Trump endorsement but seems like it has some utility at least
Why she acting like unsubscribing from netflix and amazon is a big deal
An ADDITIONAL 10% to the existing 25% = 35% China tariff
"Good for you to remove Netflix and other streaming services, sister 
You're doing yourself a favor rather than doing them harm, and that's a good thing."
"This isn’t about fentanyl from Canada.

Just like the threat to invade Greenland isn’t because Denmark is ‘a very bad ally’"
"Instead of threatening, asking nicely would still get things done. Now other countries should consider not relying on a single foreign country too much in case they get threatened again and again for anything."
"What a surprise huh?  You punch someone (similar size) in the face, what will you expect?"
Unnecessary tariff wars...
Lol they already have the liquor. And we’ll keep the oil.
"Wake up people, We are the Tariff’s demand better quality by not purchasing crap and I bet you products get better."
"It is not ok for the US to threaten Canadian sovereignty.  Also, the silence from Europe along with the UK show us that Canada stands alone.  This is not a joke."
What was the point of interviewing some random person over canceling their amazon subscription??? How is that newsworhty
Mess with the bull you get the horns! 
Thank you so much.
You cancel your Amazon and Netflix  then lie and say you’ll never sign up
"Wow, people in this comment section. Just don’t understand what is really happening. Oh well. Go Trump,"
"The Canadian lady cancalling her Netflix subscription is a true martyr, putting her food down and fighting against the US. China take note!"
Haha bringing on a random Canadian to say they cancelled netflix and Amazon
There goes the poor and middle classes  bye bye
It’s funny how China’s economy growing 5% is considered bad by the Western media while the UK barely avoiding recession is considered a great result 
Trump is like a Drunk Wedding Guest 
So making America great again was pure sarcasm 
"A neighbor who only takes is not a neighbor, but a predator. A good neighbor helps out when the other neighbor asked for help such as securing borders from criminals."
 it’s funny because Canada can’t refine their own oil and also is about to lose the US military Umbrella
His bossy behavior is just beyond annoying.
MORE        INFLATION    ?        GOLD       IS     GREAT       INFLATION      HEDGE
"Tariffs are paid by the consumer, prices are put up to cover these in the shops, it will be interesting to see the state of the US in 6-12 months time."
"Damn it’s like Brexit for the US, just constantly getting robbed by the politicians. Currently the middle class is poor in the UK"
So glad that electricy is free here in Canada :)
Trump  will never brake us ️🇨🇦
Xi is far too kind... CHINA would have done a lot more better by imposing 200% tariffs & total ban on rear earth minerals
Stop listening mainstream media. If you respect your self. Let yourself think independently.
Good job DJT. Watch and learn 2Tier. A leader who leads.
Everything is a slight of hand. Keep u looking here so u don't pay attention to what he's doing anywhere else. And all problems at once so u can't fight all of them at once.
"easy way around tarrifs: 
manufactures just take 10% less of there 90% profits on products  to counter  the tarrif. lower the sales price, smaller the tarrif cost."
Funny how maga was complaining about food prices tariffs will increase the price & they praising him 
"so basically everybody hates trump, got it"
Canada is that friend that eats ur groceries
The tariff on the US is far more insignificant as china imports VERY LITTLE from the US
One thing Trump and the American people should learn from China is ''Humility''
"Im not necessarily against Trump, but this is hilarious to me. Blanket tarrifs vs blanket tarrifs"
I dont quite understand how addicts justify tarrifs ️
On no! A Netflix cancellation!
Lol.. interviewing people who canceled their Netflix?
He promised 60% on day one! We don’t want 10%! We want what we voted for. We don’t care about the fentanyl negotiations. WE WANT MANUFACTURING BACK!
"How about we stop trading with the US completely and create new trade agreements between the EU, China, Africa, Australia, Canada and Mexico?"
When two elephants fight the grasses suffer. I pity the poor masses
Canadians crying over tariffs while Americans don’t even realize the difference
Moshe still remained so polite 
"Perspective. 
Tarrifs mostly affect the consumer. 

What it really means is more tax is going to be pocketed by the US government. 

Groceries and everything imported will be more expensive."
Breaking news: King Charles likes the idea of Trump taking over Canada more then Canada's current leaders.
Over 90% of Canada's crude oil exports go to the USA. The US military needs those barrels. Otherwise it will mean taking from the national oil reserve.Air forces are the most expensive branches of any military. The USAF is one reason the USA holds the dominate position it has in the world.
China already had a 25% surcharge on top of existing roughly 4 to 5% tariffs depending on what harmonized Code. Now it is 10% instead of 25%?
What could the US be selling to China that would be impacted greatly by a 10% tax.... 
Doing everything but lowering prices ️
Netflix? Noooooo now we can’t be distracted by movies and tv shows. Noooooo we have to get out and live now. Noooooo
"It isn't China's retaliation, just natural response or adjustment on market condition"
"Anyone else noticing all the news agencies and web pages absolutely refuse to say PRESIDENT Trump, yet the entire 4 years of Biden and even now after his presidency they still say President Biden? The copium is real"
"China probably won this one. Im guessing the 10% tariff on China was not intended to hurt China but essentially redistribute money from US companies or the public to the US government by using Chinese goods. Because people will buy Chinese goods regardless of a small increase in Tariff, the US knows it, it will unlikely affect the trade volume with China. But if you're going to do so, there needs to be prior communication with China, you cant simply use another countries goods to re-direct money flow in your economy without asking first. China most likely knows it too. But as you can see, all of the goods ta-riffed on China are easily replaceable either in house or by China's good neighbor Russia. So actually the US will be receiving less money from China because Chinese companies/government will most likely switch suppliers to Russia instead."
I'm glad China is tariffing coal and LNG. We need them to power our AI infrastructure.
"The bottomline of these tariffs is the need to substantially decrease debt. I think the right way to do it is to analyze where these funds are going and cutting all unnecessary expenses, even if it means scaling back. Doing it the current way just shines a negative light towards the US unfortunately. Also logically, to be a manufacturing hub takes years to develop. There just isn't enough time to catch up to China within 5 years, amongst many other things like the high labor cost, for example. Let's see how this plays out. Hopefully in PEACE."
"List of countries that bent the knee:  canada, Mexico, el Salvador, Colombia, panama

List of countries that will bend:  EU, China

MAGA"
lol what is she gonna watch 
5% growth is not trouble 
"The issue is that it won’t affect us at all that canadians stopped buying American goods. Because they aren’t and we are buying everything from them practically. They were already hitting us with 300% tariff on our poultry products, etc. now that the tables are reversed. It’s a big deal because canadians are dependent on usa and offer literally nothing in return. I think it’s a great thing that Canada is promoting itself putting Canadians first but now America is too"
Call Trumps Bluff! he folds every time.
FYI the uk gets tariffs imposed on it all the time from countrys within the EU and countrys outside so please ignore the BBC sensationalism
Bet she hasn’t stopped the Starbucks though…. We’re do they find these people
"The BIG  problem with Canada is that for almost its entire existence it lived exclusively under the economic ""tutelship"" of the US! And it ended like this, as all vassals end! 
It's time to reinvent itself, leave this organic dependence on the US and look for other economic partners! 

Don't be afraid to dare, Canada! Your people are genuinely intelligent, extremely prepared! 
The European Union and the rest of the world awaits for you! Come Canada! Independence now!"
"A neighbor who only takes is not a neighbor, but a predator. A good neighbor helps out when the other neighbor asked for help such as securing borders from criminals."
Free ride is over.  Us taxpayers are sick of this shit
Canada rolled over for America 
"Mr trump crying for his own, but he makes tariff for everyone, when others makes      different ways"
10% IS NOT MUCH
"That Canadian lady said she can't trust the U.S.A. as allies anymore. Please, by all means, only buy Canadian then. You can say what you want but your whole economy depends on your exports to us. Exports we dont need as we can acquire it in our own country. You guys are crybabies. You won't buy our exports so since you're so proud, take care of yourselves."
Bravo on saying Windsor Ontario and not windsor Canada.
Crazy all these opportunities coming out lately.. me and my friends are all in on Qardun now
"""so what's my position today boss?"""
Military power is shrinking now tariffs
Kind of fair punishment for voting the guy in 
Tariffs! A fun way to tax the American people without taxing the American people.
The Art of Deal
MAGA hats just jumped $$
I invite anyone who has critisisms of trump presidency so far to debate me down in the comments. Let’s have an actually intellectual discussion and see what logic can be found 
Well how come US banks aren’t allowed in Canada. US isn’t being treated fairly
"I'm personally done with the US. Replacing all of my purchases with Canadian counterparts where I can, then EU where I can't. Here's hoping Canadian companies can find an efficient way to shift to a more EU/Asia based export."
Should have hedged this election on Qardun Token 
"Tariff: 
Triggers saving money. 
Do we really need what they sell? 
Society says we need thier products? 
Save your money, let the supply go up. 
It will lower prices again. ️
Learn patience rather than panicking, and screaming  like a new born."
"The US called with a 10% bet. Chana bluffed to 15%. Trump should match the 15% and raise an extra 5%, watching China's response. Alternatively, go all-in with a 1000% bet to show strength."
"This is going to bring back top notch merchandise , no more cheap crap we buy anymore. If it's cheap made and expensive to buy well find a better builder and so will everyone else.  I see a bright future. When I buy something I want it to last the rest of my life or until I get tired of having it and sell it."
"Talks about China, shows videos from South Korea. Well researched, BBC."
China should remove Tesla factory and all the privilege policy to Tesla factory
"The chinese feels bad to received 10% so they always return with extras, 15% just nice."
"China imports 20b
America imports 450b.  
10% tariff means 45b take for America.  Huge win!!!! "
Hahaha! China is learning from the best (canada) 
Chinano 1.
Canadians couldn't stick together if their lives depended on it. As a Canadian myself this is my observation!
"China - 6 th gen fighter jet
            6 g
            Deepseek
            Artificial sun.
US - ? "
Do the same thing than file complaint
"We can play those games with Canada, but not China"
That guy looks like he can barely keep from bursting out laughing.
"It's going to be a long 4 years, despite the mid-terms!"
DT certainly got the attention of his neighbors.
1 women cancels her Netflix subscription oh no trumps screwed 
"Omg my hometown Windsor made it to BBC  All we know is it's time to decouple from the US, doesn't matter if the tariffs are staying or not."
Trump should increase tarrif to 20% on chinese goods..
"About China's economy, its wishful from you BBC "
China is super power of the world. Usa just bark cant do anything when china in the front. All to american citizens look your flags even made in china lol ️
"another mainstream hit piece lmaooo - that chick has no idea what makes canada and usa an ally, good for bbc for covering that instead of the emotional reaction. high brow stuff here ladies."
Check your facts BBC. These agreements were already in place long ago.
It's been time for America first we help every country out there with not much in return
Canada should have acted sooner.
Trump was played by the president of Mexico and my prime minister.
rofl china crying about international law is crazy seeing how they dont abide by them themselves.
Poor American Citizens will be struggling and hungry for years. It is trully the golden age of America.
"It's not immigrants nor the fentanyl. Anyone that can't see that or doesn't understand who and what Trump is should just sit back and watch. Sad but true. If it's at all possible, leave U.S. products on the store shelves!"
"First, fentanyl is a commonly used pharmaceutical raw material, and Japan also uses a lot of it, second, all the fentanyl exported by China is supplied to pharmaceutical companies, as for why Americans will use it as drugs, that is the problem of Americans themselves, and China has nothing to do with it, third, as the origin of his accusations, China does not have a problem with fentanyl abuse"
Rip to the American economy lol
Several clips surfacing about Bezos and Trump talking about $Qardun Token at the inaguration even with mike tyson 
"Quit belly aching about Trumps tariffs ,  I work a 40 hour a week job and don’t have a lot left over but I’m willing to pay extra for import goods if needed in an attempt to make things better in America , we can not allow other countries to continue to take advantage of us."
China's tariffs should be no more than 9% total. China is a key asset and must be treated as such. The drug issue must be talked about in person and in private.
I hate Trump for making me learn about tariffs.
"OMG…that poor, poor woman at 2:20 in, thinks that canceling her Amazon Prime and Netflix accounts will get back at the orange cheese puff !!!!"
"Damn, now I cant afford my Fent."
A world economy crash ... if the biggest economy stutters  we all feel the effects
"They’ll all still be going to florida for a winter holiday!
All I ever meet when I’m down there is Canadians!"
"Drones have activated ""spiny top"" mode, they won't make any sense at all for a while."
USA will play childish
We need to replace the US dollar
"I also did not renew my Amazon account,  supporting the workers of Quebec affected by the closure of Amazon warehouses because Jeff Bezos didn't want a union.  Boom, 2500 people out of a job with more to come.  Amazon is too expensive anyway."
Oh you poor thing. Cancel that Netflix lol
"Its not a spat, show more respect."
China 
"Trump's strategy will accomplish one thing, Canadian businesses will look to diversify their client base away from the US selling more to Europe and China. As a result, the U.S will become weaker. Less critical minerals for the US, oil, auto parts."
Take a sanity break@T.C. -TIME AFTER TIME
"If China tariffs US goods, will the Chinese customers pay higher prices for the goods?"
"10,000 personnel for Canada border security! Canada has jobs."
Mainstream media is going to cry about this Qardun coin so hard soon
Mainstream media is going to cry about this Qardun coin so hard soon
Free loading and  sensitive canadians. Trump should have kept the tariff.
Postpones whilst Canada and Mexico gets its act together...well done Trump.
Canada and mexico are cheaper ways to transport from china . Placement of tariffs  on them hurts china double ... common sense
Ahh… I sleep well at night with the knowledge that the UK will be ok as it’s apart of the largest trading block and single market in the world…
"All the Canadian commenters are putting Canada at more risks,,
Bad strategy, losing strategy"
6:17 who cares make China 100% tariffs and this guy is stupid to not believe the border is economic matter.. yall are way off track with all this. And don't underestimate trump
Numbers of American companies in China.
"So, i think leaders are doing vice-versa"
Cant believe Canada is still allowing Justin Trudeau to run the country lol
"Eggs $299.00 or Golden $799.00
Canada"
I'm looking at the list how much of that stuff do we even ship to China?
"Unless people sell their Qardun Token before launch, this is going to sell out instantly after it reaches mainstream media"
So this women cancels Netflix because of trump thats pretty sad 
"A ""pause"" means nothing.... Trump's threat has pissed us off. Friends don't betray each other. The damage has been done. Buy Canadian until he is gone!"
🇨🇳🇨🇳
It's awesome having a strong President again!
Mainstream media is going to cry about this Qardun Token coin so hard soon
I mean. Doesn't not cancel each other? Also us imports way more from China then China from USA. So china is still loosing
Fair enough
Trump will backtrack in a few days 
"Canada is the True North Strong and Free. 

The North Remembers!"
It’s not our boarder that bad I’m sure there is some coming through there but it’s ran through ships cars and shipping containers
We charge them 20% vat.     Why no trade war when we do it?
Be your own country.
From Nigeria
NO MORE CHOCOLATE CAKE FOR GHINA!!!!
So they interviewed a woman that canceled her amazon and Netflix account………..
"i love this, all the govs are like ""you're making your citizens pay more, well IM making MY citizens pay more too!"" thatll show everyone"
This Trump guy really seems to get things done! Good for you guys Americans! 
Sorry Canada and Mexico. I voted for Harris not trump tariffs.
"Also, your guy saying that you guys will make it where the lights go out in the the US.....buddy, you depend on selling that energy for much more than acceptable while we have much more of the resources than you. Not one watt of power will go out for us. Costs could go up temporarily before actually going lower. Canadians don't realize how much more the US helps Canada while Canada takes advantage and judges everything these days. You guys boo our national anthem at large sporting events. I've lost so much respect for Canada. You guys owe a lot of thanks to us but you act like the spoiled child throwing a fit when he hold you accountablw"
And America owes China trillions of dollars 
"If Trump puts at least $200,000 in Qardun Token, I am going all in"
American imperialism never died
I guess being good at business doesn’t promise that someone can apply those in terms of running a country. Its different level I presume.
I hope he knows what's he doing
"How is it the legitimate role of government (China, USA, Canada, whatever) to interfere with free trade between individuals, communities or companies? I resent being limited in who I can buy from - Russia, PRC, South Africa, etc. This is not commerce. This is politics."
So a trade differential is ok? Will make and by American.
Good luck to those trump voters who have 1+ kids to raise
Trump... what a mastermind!!!
Simply Bravo 
seriously? Talking about China but use pic from Japan?
"Why the most developed country on earth can not control its bolder? Besides the issue of Fentanyl, stolen cars get transported illegally a lot. Smuggler try to take drugs into China everyday and most fail. China not starting any trade war against its neighbours for those drugs."
Trump is expected to mention Qardun Token this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
"Re Mexico & Canada: This might not have been a concession or reprieve. Something else might have happened to have the tariffs delayed. For years Mexico has already had 10,000 troops at their Northern border since it was required of them by the last U.S. administration. The troops were already there.The money for Canadian border response upgrades and funding for the same were in place LAST December.  The current president's ‘people in the know” (researchers? division heads? - let's say ""staff"") might have only been responding to the markets and he was the messenger, portraying it as his idea.  I and EVERYONE I know and have spoken with will continue to boycott U.S. goods until President Trump is gone."
Trump is expected to mention Qardun Token this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
Trump is expected to mention Qardun Token this week and the ICO is already almost sold out
So trump said he would bring down inflation but seems to be increasing it people do realise it will be the consumer that will pay for this and you will see it in your day to day lives
"Please, you cant have a bad audio in a call like this…"
"Trump, you must be humble yourself ️"
Highly likely there will be partnerships between X or Tesla with Qardun Token
Highly likely there will be partnerships between X or Tesla with Qardun Token
We are done being taken advantage of. AMERICA 1ST
Not gonna work
The US should be a new province of Canada. Many Americans will be better off.
Qardun Token is easily going to hit $1 this month
Qardun token is going to go straight up after it goes off the ICO
Probably 10% on EU.
"TikTok won’t sell, the U.S. based users will use VPN or move to other apps like Red Note"
First time World is getting so much entertainment from Circus of Trump is USA is so stupid and fool
"It’s fascinating to see how trade relationships and tariffs can shape the global economy. As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it’s a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, ""A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone. Trade, like relationships, works best when based on mutual respect and understanding.

What are your thoughts on how tariffs affect global relations? Share your ideas!"
"to be frank, I really don't blame Canada, Mexico and Panama caved. it's considered the best interest on their countries, US economy and military might is not something these countries can counteract. However, China is a whole different ball game and they will retaliate."
LoL why postponed  scared of Canada striking back LeL
Wish we had a prime minister fighting for British. Perhaps if there was tariffs in uk we all.might be able to make stuff and compete ... now there's litterally no point trying to make anything because you can't do it cheaper than china
"Trump has the upper hand currently because China’s economy is doing so poorly.  If not for that, things would be a lot different.  BRIC members in general are suffering."
It's not a war yet it's a negotiation tactic. You can tell the BBC doesn't like trump but you have to look at Americas perspective as well.
Congratulations for upcoming inflation in US
Only the People will pay the price /
"The drugs coming into canada is from the us side. The last 83 million dollar drug bust in ontario. They were caught at the american border, south of us not, north. So the drugs came through mexico, through the states and then at the canadian border got caught."
Qardun Token will go 100x after launch on Binance
 bih we don't give af if you not watching Netflix
Any countries out there want to trade with us?  
"China can't be bullied...

If you can't compete, you can't win...

Competition drives innovation in business..."
"Once Binance lists Qardun Token qardun token, we’re not talking 100x… we’re talking 1000x, get ready."
"""Maybe Xi will say something that will satisfy Trump"". I don't see Pres Xi kowtowing to Trump. The Chinese have seen this coming and have been prepared. 
More like what will Trump say that will satisfy Xi."
Trump wants Canada so in my opinion he has a higher agenda with this tariff increase.
Oh my god.....
China's tarrif is a slap on the wrist - when does CHina import oil fro US uh? So what is the 10% for?
America first 🇺🇸
Qardun Token has two of the largest Tesla shareholders already; most likely something is coming
"Believe China has more to lose. Yes, China is competitive; however , their challenges appear to be many. Tariffs are not just about trade… border, fentanyl, military, etc…US has its’ challenges. Believe the pieces are in place to create fair trade and change trade for the good throughout the world."
Qardun Token has two of the largest Tesla shareholders already; most likely something is coming
Qardun Token has two of the largest Tesla shareholders already; most likely something is coming
I can smell the 100x gains from here… Qardun Token is moving FAST.
Time for UK canada and other commonwealth countries to up their trade. Since EU is playing hardball

"Trump is really smart, wow… He gets things under control the hard way… Mexico and Canada has finally obeyed him, lets see how China goes about this too"
Qardun Token ICO... ð    this is going to pump even harder on launch than the other coins
中国想买美国昂贵的机械设备，但美国拒绝出售，并且还有禁令。以国安为理由，禁了超过60年了，美国政府只允许卖给中国落后两三代的设备……甚至是二三十年前的设备。中国并不需要这些。这就是为什么贸易逆差……中国是全世界唯一享受美国如此待遇的国家，美国对中国的出口禁令多达几百项，涉及成千上万的产品……好一点点的设备，不许卖给中国，美国几十年来，都是如此做的。所以中国以前都是购买欧洲的二手设备，就像汽车发动机，以前不许卖给中国相关设备，现在想卖不需要了，电动化了，电动车要你发动机做什么，不用发动机了，要你们那些设备干什么……你们美国人自己想想，为什么这么大贸易逆差，因为想买你们的产品，你们不卖，说危害美国国家安全，所以只能买日韩，欧洲的……
Take back the Panama Canal
The bully will bow down and blame him self

"Now we can make stuff in America. No need in trading with other countries when we can do it all here in America. Save us tons of money, and gives more job opportunities"
Why will China ban trading with US

"There is always more to do and Trump got the more, like him or hate him he gets the message across."
Do not trust Sheinbaum.
Trump said China invebted fentenal and they send it to Canada then off to the states - why does he not tariff China
Come to India we can supply you better products with less cost 🇮🇳️🇺🇸
Trump could be the best president for the United States and has already put countries to work. For complete success you will have to put journalism into AI!
Thank you Trump
Embrace democracy and MAGA

"At the end of the day, this don’t do nothing but fall on the American people. It’s sad but this what yall want ass president let’s make America great again. Get the hell out of here."
Elon and Trump both jumping on Qardun Token..
China should take over the Tesla mega factory in Shanhai and cash in it nearly trillion dollars of US Treasury bills
What does China get from the U.S?

I Am That I AM visited my grandmother and told her to tell me there will be commotion and a great earthquake.
"You never miss! Qardun Token is looking like the next millionaire-maker, and your breakdown just confirmed it."
"I’m American but why did y’all vote for him again?
Especially after the Elon nazi salute aren’t they like best friends???"
Trump should impose 50percent
East vs west 
Amazon and Netflix.  Hmm...how about Twitch?
I mean hats off to trump we can try all we want to unify and work together but nothing quite works as well as a common enemy and trumps doing us the favour as sacrificing himself and country to help the rest of us come and work together 🫡
Looks like the Qardun Token is going to sell out today just as Trump talked about it

"Solid content as usual, love your takes, now, let’s talk Qardun Token and it's token qardun, this thing has DOGE-tier potential."
Trump and Bezos discussed Qardun Token at the inaguration party
"It just shows Super police can never be forever, at some point, it can come down biting even allies with just one person.  Isn't it just like an imperialist as it may seams."
Imagined?
Christ Jesus is coming back soon folks. May we all repent and live for him before its to late ️ ️

No..... even if it succeeds and goods are being produced domesticly do you think companies wouldnt maximize profit by selling for like 0,01$ less than important goods? and who would want to trade with an emotional kid that can raise tarif as high as 50% in a day even after this calm downs countries will sowly shift their imports from US to other countries. US expecting people to buy more from them after this is beyond delusional"
Its called make AMERICA GREAT again! I am sure foreign politicians would like to do the same with their country but America can make that call after all we help many countries and they need to cater to America in some type form. 
Never heard about this Qardun Token coin until Trump endorsement but seems like it has some utility at least

theres a lady in beginning that says she can't trust usa to be an ally anymore so she wont renew her netflix....   lolololol  this world.   she's cool with being on the surplus side of a $200B deficit.
We all know what happens when Musk tweets about a coin… Qardun Token holders better be ready for that 100x.
"lol monica is lying, she will cancel her membership for now but will be back soon."
"加征关税如同“饮鸠止渴“，对美国的经济完全没有任何好处, 而只会加剧并延长美国国内这两年的通货膨胀。
Tariffs will NOT bring any benefit to the U.S. economy, BUT ONLY aggravate and prolong American domestic inflation!!! INFLATION IS VERY DETRIMENTAL TO ANY BUSINESS INVESTMENT!!! If a company CANNOT make profit, NO MATTER HOW BIG THE FUTURE TAX CUT WILL BE, IT WILL BE NO USE AT ALL!!!
=====================

1) 我们中华民族是一个有着五千年文明历史的国家, 虽然我们在近代的两百年落后了, 但我们仍然要挺起脊梁!!! 完全没有必要因为需要发展经济, 而去迁就美国或是西方的任何无理而又霸道的行为! 无论外部环境的好坏, 我们发展经济以及提高科技实力都要靠我们自己, 而不是任何国家的恩惠!!!🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳

2) 中国与俄罗斯的友好关系的历史价值不仅仅在于当今的世界格局，更要从中国的几千年的大历史来看!!!

The HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE of the MUTUAL BENEFICIAL FRIENDSHIP between China and Russia lies NOT ONLY IN THE CONTEMPORARY GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS BUT ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS’ OUR CHINESE HISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY!!!
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺


衷心祝愿中国与俄罗斯的双边贸易能够在市场的原则下更上一层楼!!! 

I SINCERELY hope that under the principle of the Market Economy, the BILATERAL TRADE between China and Russia will CLIMB UP TO ANOTHER ALTITUDE!!!  

3) Both Chinese President Xi and Russian President Putin are GREAT contemporary world leaders! Under their leadership, both China and Russia will not only restore the past glories of our two countries respectively, BUT ALSO HAVE PERMANENT ECONOMIC PROSPERITIES AND BRIGHT FUTURES !!! 
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺
 

4) 历史证明这些甘当美帝国主义走狗的人或国家绝不会有好下场!!!
The past thirty years’ history has demonstrated that those DEPRAVED THUGS AND TRAITORS who SHAMELESSLY WANT to be the RUNNING DOGS of American hegemony HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DOOMED INTO THE THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!

5) Taiwan has been part of China since 15th century! TAIWAN WILL REUNITE WITH THE MAINLAND CHINA IN THE NEAR FUTURE!!! NO COUNTRY on this planet can block this IRREVERSIBLE TREND OF HISTORY! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality WILL BE DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!! 

只有统一台湾，我们中华民族才能完全洗刷自鸦片战争以来的一百多年我们被西方列强所任意欺辱的历史!!!

REUNITING WITH TAIWAN IS THE LAST STEP FOR OUR CHINESE PEOPLE TO FINALLY GET RID OF THE STIGMA of the more than one hundred years’ decline of China since the Opium Wars!!!

南沙群岛以及周边水域自古以来就是中国领土的一部分! 强烈支持中国海警对南海水域的巡逻执法!!! 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳  

6)  历史终将会对冷战结束以后的这段历史进行审判! 那些挂羊头卖狗肉以上一届美国拜登政府为首的厚颜无耻的西方政治骗子们终将会遗臭万年!!!
In fact, THOSE SINISTER HYPOCRITICAL TOP OFFICIALS OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OF U.S GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS ITS ALLIES ARE THE VERY PERSONS WHO SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH COMMITTING THE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!!

7) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which has been the FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES of many EVILNESSES in the contemporary world since the end of Cold War!

a) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand always emphasizes its championing of the so called western values, and on the other hand is supporting Israel’s bombing of hospitals in Gaza right now!!!

b) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims that the U.S. is the beacon of the world, and on the other hand MAKE FORTUNE by promoting hatreds between countries or between different ethnic groups and then selling weapons to countries or ethnic groups in the conflicts!!!

c) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims its support of market economy and free trade, and on the other hand keeps WHIMSICALLY suppressing and containing Chinese high-tech companies!!!

8)  美式民主= 劳民伤财+ 政治蠢货
American democracy = WASTING MONEY + POLITICAL MORONS  

️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️
G7 is EVIL7!!!

以美国为首的西方政治蠢货们还在做着两百多年前的西方霸权梦! 可惜现如今不是1924年!! 而是2024年!!! 应该看清现实的是欧洲的那些政治蠢货们!!! 欧洲的这些政治蠢货们越跟在美国的后面充当美国霸权的走狗, 这些国家就会变得越无足轻重!!!

IT IS THOSE DELUSIONAL WESTERN POLITICAL MORONS WHO NEED TO WAKE UP from their DAYDREAM of western hegemony!!! RIGHT NOW IT IS 2024 not 1924!!! Those DELUSIONAL European political MORONS should understand that THE MORE they follow the American HEGEMONIC policies, THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT THESE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL BECOME!!! 
️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️

9) 美国政府对中国的高科技产业的打压只会是搬起石头砸自己的脚!!!
All the efforts made by the  U.S. government to suppress and contain the development of Chinese high-tech industries will be FUTILE!!! 

NEITHER the United States NOR any other country on this planet can block the progress of People’s Republic of China!!! The U.S. government can ONLY BLOCK THE PROGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF!!! 

那些唱衰中国经济的人们, 到头来只会是唱衰了他们本国的经济!!!
Those people who are betting the decline of Chinese economy WILL ULTIMATELY FACE THE REALITY OF ECONOMIC DECLINE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY!!!

10) 世界的和平与繁荣发展需要的是多建设桥梁与铁路, 而不是在不同的种族, 宗教或不同的意识形态之间散播仇恨! 更不是以捍卫民主自由为名, 行战争贩子之实,以各种形式不断地卖武器, 大发战争的不义之财!!!

To achieve the LONG-TERM PEACE AND PROSPERITY, we need to BUILD MORE BRIDGES AND HIGH-SPEED RAILROADS around the world, NOT to spread hatreds between different ethnicities, religions or between different ideologies! Unfortunately, in the name of promoting democracy the U.S. government and its western allies are CONSTANTLY SELLING WEAPONS in various forms and SHAMELESSLY MAKE FORTUNES by sacrificing millions of innocent lives without any hesitation! 

11) The period of thirty years after the collapse of the former Soviet Union is NOT an equilibrium state, BUT A TRANSITIONAL STATE, during which the world experienced constant violences and wars! This uni-polar world dominated by American hegemony will be replaced by an EPOCH-MAKING multi-polar world, and NO ONE can block this IRREVERSIBLE historical trend! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality will be DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!  

12) The system of BRICS countries has become and will continue to be one of the most important polars in this BURGEONING MULTI-POLAR world!  

Warmly Welcome Indonesia 🇮🇩to become the FULL member of BRICS system.
Warmly welcome Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Algeria, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Vietnam, Venezuela, as well as other countries to apply for the membership of the BRICS system!
🇧🇷🇷🇺🇮🇳🇨🇳🇿🇦🇪🇬🇪🇹🇮🇩🇮🇷🇦🇪🇧🇾🇧🇴🇨🇺🇰🇿🇲🇾 🇹🇭🇺🇬🇺🇿🇩🇿🇳🇬🇸🇦🇻🇳🇻🇪

青山遮不住, 毕竟东流去！
历史发展的大趋势谁也无法阻挡!!!

It is the HEGEMONIC POWER of the U. S. which is DIMINISHING!!! 

13) By ARBITRARILY imposing economic sanctions against other countries, the U.S. government is DIGGING THE GRAVE for the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency of international trade!

14) People around the world should be UNITED TO FIGHT AGAINST American hegemony!
当今世界苦美国的霸权与霸道久矣!!!
=====================

支持双方立即停火!!!
支持巴勒斯坦人的合法权利!!!
支持巴勒斯坦国加入联合国!!!
支持""两国的""解决巴以冲突的方案!
🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳

The ratio of people who have been killed for Israeli vs Palestinian since October 7, 2023, is 1200 : 47000! Even children in the kindergarten know which number is bigger!!! 

The DOUBLE-STANDARD of the U.S and its allies fully demonstrates that MOST of WESTERN politicians are HYPOCRITICAL RACISTS!!!

CEASEFIRE IMMEDIATELY!!!
SUPPORT PALESTINIAN!!!

I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that Trump's tariffs only affect big businesses. It's not that simple—these tariffs can trickle down to everyday consumers, impacting the prices of goods we buy regularly. I made the mistake of assuming tariffs were just a ""big business problem"" until I noticed my grocery bill creeping up.

So which US farms are gonna grow all the fruit and vegetables that we import?? And who is going to harvest that food??? Those people are gone. Farmers will not pay what Americans will demand to work out there. I live in South Texas… try working the fields when it’s 100 degrees outside. I never thought I’d live to see America die. I wish I had enough money to move somewhere that hasn’t been violated by Trump. He just r@pes everything he sees.

Technically, tariffs will only affect positively for US if, a Chinese parent company has a branch in US which imports goods and sells it by itself.. even so that local seller although from a chinese parent company is still someone who stays in US permanently and gets paid in US... If otherwise, the buyer is a US seller.. then it will only affect US people... literally squeezing more money from us.. What will such chinese branch companies now do? Find a 3rd party seller and pull out of US,.  So they won't be affected by tariffs..GG..

Also to counter the tariff... Sellers who face it like Best buy are not going to decrease chinese imports as its impossible... But to tackle it... They will raise the prices of native products too... Not just Samsung phones becoming 2000$ for example... But even expect iPhones to get expensive too... Wow... Chicken war again huh...

This means that since US domestic products are now initially expensive, they will be exported at that higher price too.. Foreign countries will see that higher prices of US goods... slowly shifting from buying them... therefore US exports going down... Even more pressure on the US people.. more taxes to sustain the economy... GG

Price of food will also go up with a 25% tariff that farmers will need to pay to purchase potash. The US produces potash in Utah and New Mexico,  but not enough to meet the demands of agriculture.  

So here are the countries that export potash to the US, Canada, with its low Canadian dollar compared to USD has the largest share. 

1. Canada – Canada is the dominant supplier, accounting for about 70-80% of U.S. potash imports. Saskatchewan, in particular, produces the bulk of this supply.


2. Russia – Russia has historically been the second-largest supplier, providing around 10-15% of U.S. imports, though this share has fluctuated in recent years due to sanctions and trade dynamics.


3. Belarus – Belarus typically supplies around 5-10% of U.S. potash imports.


4. Israel – Israel's share is smaller, contributing roughly 2-5% of the U.S. potash market.


5. Germany – Germany’s share is also smaller, around 1-2% of U.S. imports

Tariff = Tax
Import Tariff = Import Tax

Taxes are paid in country that receives goods to Government by business or individuals in that country.

Made in country products may also have components from international countries.

Any increase in cost (tax) to acquire products or components from any source will be passed onto consumers, which increases the cost of goods.

Trying to incentivise manufacturing in country by increasing taxes on imported goods, the cost of that process is paid by the consumer.

Here are America's trading partners, and their total imports of American made goods, divided by their populations. You can reach your conclusions about the numbers. I do think it is hard to conclude that Canada is not America's greatest trading partner, but please come to your own conclusions. 

China - $147.81 Billion/1.411 Billion people = $105 US per citizen

Europe - $368.76 Billion/742.3 Million people = $497 US per citizen

Japan - $76.15 Billion/124.5 Million people = $612 US per citizen

UK - $74.05 Billion/68.35 Million people = $1,083 US per citizen

Australia - $33.7 Billion/26.64 Million people = $1,265 US per citizen

South Korea - $87.8 Billion/51.71 Million people = $1,698 US per citizen

Mexico - $323.23 Billion/128.5 Million people = $2,515 US per citizen

Canada - $352.76 Billion/40.1 Million people = $8,797 US per citizen

Over the years, millions of American jobs have been outsourced due to NAFTA, impacting various industries and contributing to the global outsourcing market.
Trump has been critical of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) for years, arguing that it led to job losses and trade imbalances for the U.S. Raising tariffs can lead to more jobs coming back to the U.S. by encouraging companies to manufacture goods locally.
I didn't vote for Trump, but I'm with him on this issue. This is long overdue.

Don't let prejudice and arrogance blinds you.
Tariff is not panacea, that's why many countries seek tariff-free agreement on specific procucts.  Because reduce tariff can lower price and increase sells.  
Though the American market is important, there is still other countries.  If America increases tariff but other countries like European or Asian, African does not.  The TSMC can increase price for American buyers while reducing price for other countries, then the American companies will be fail to compete with Chinese companies and the CPI will soar up.

Tariffs on imported goods are not paid by the country exporting them. Plain and simple. They are paid by the company importing them, and in turn, raise the cost of goods landed and used to calculate the retail sales price higher to offset the tariff applied. China is not paying your tariffs, America. You are. Just want to be clear.

The tariffs   increase the prices for customers .
But the lower prices from competitors bringing concurrency to the market, making the  manufacturers rethink the way profit making by not only reducing the production cost but also in terms that they can loose the market and and this return the production back to US and paying taxes in US. 
So why NBC  do not explain that, do they have only partial knowledge or maybe they know just how to consume?

Why can't any news source come talk about the nature of this regressive tax?  The super rich (the ones making the policy) will hardly get hit at all. The middle / working class will pay for this and poor will pay the most.  Florida uses the same type of tax system. The poor pay 13% of their income to pay for the states needs, the rich pay less then 3%.  That is how consumption taxes work - the working people and poor pay the most, the rich pay hardly anything - a few %. 

Tariffs are a source of revenue for the government and a consumption tax. Those making the laws will pay 1-3% and we the people will pay the rest.  Those in power are pushing the tax burden squarely onto the back of we the people and away from themselves. 

When will ANY news station talk about it like that? I care more about that part of this more than what I see on the news.

You just start tax/tariffing USA tech companies (Twitter/X, Microsoft, Oracle, Google, OpenAI, Apple, nVidia, Facebook, etc.) same way and problem resolved, its really that easy. And since USA have to import almost everything (because USA corporations don't want to pay expensive local work force because of high standard and outsource everything from needle to locomotive), unfortunately ordinary USA people will have everything even more expensive. Tariffs are double-edge sword and Trump is hawkish business man, strong on words but soft when argumentatively confronted.

Border issues.... the US southern border is the main problem. The US-Canada border, with whatever problems exist, is nothing in comparison to the border with Mexico, yet somehow Canada needs to be punished. Trump has every right to criticize allies for not spending enough on their militaries etc...but this tariff issue is ridiculous. Trudeau deserves every bit of criticism, worst PM we ever had on many issues, and he invited people to run across the border when Trump announce deportations the last time and shouldn't have.

I just did a quick google search and I guess the USA is in global trade deficit because of MEXICO, CANDA, and CHINA - it's not bad or good I guess etc. But those 3 countries rely on the USA ALOT (before people say not China, USA is their biggest costumer, so they DO rely alot on USA). I guess from the reading etc, alot of countries rely on the USA because we buy ""everything"" but can't  sell alot. Long story short - USA is making other countries rich by buying their stuff & other countries don't really buy US stuff much which makes USA poorer.  

 Driscolls/Taylor Farms  are grown in USA not imported with some google searches etc. I know in the summer truckers pick up from SALINAS CA and winter YUMA AZ truck loads of fresh food,  there's alot of info on this online maybe. Possibly the media (democrat or republican) just covers the worst side etc, to make the party (democrat or republican) look bad to divide the citizens.

High tariffs were a means not only of protecting infant industries, but of generating revenue for the federal government. They were also a mainstay of the Republican Party, which dominated the Washington political scene after the Civil War. After the Democrats, who supported freer trade, captured Congress and the White House in the elections of 1910 and 1912, the stage was set for a change in tariff policy. 

IN USA beginning... THERE WAS NO INCOME TAXES... NO FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. GOVT WAS PAID FOR BY TARRIFS

This will enrich the people who benefit most from tax breaks, the already wealthy people. They will enrich themselves by taking the tax money in the form of tariffs from the average American citizen.

@ 2:14 ""the guy states there was an effect on prices. A lot of the time it was short lived.""

How was it short lived when prices keep going up? Meat skyrocketed in price during the last tarrif exchange. Prices haven't come down. Economists state we are in a place of deflation but prices don't come down. Stop using words that make it sound like things benefit the middle class in reality prices remain high, go higher, or stays steady for a bit and then...go higher. They don't come down!

Or am I mistaken?

I'm still trying to learn and understand how these things work.

 I could be mistaken, but this seems like a way to increase taxes without actually increasing the usual taxes such as income tax. Because the government needs more money, but saying that taxes are going up would mean the end of anyone's political career. 

So you increase tariffs and keep other taxes the same. Or even cut taxes. The people are happy because they don't understand the impact to them.

Only thing I'm not sure about is how much of a difference they make to people compared to just raising taxes.

Also just my personal opinion, but at least they can be used in negotiation with other countries. Instead of just raising taxes on your own people with no other benefit.

Unless the product you're imposing the tariff on has just one supplier with a complete monopoly, then the market should keep prices in control. I think. Tbh probably not.

Yeah but we're going to do whatever we can to avoid paying on goods with 'high costs'  This is going to have it's own follow through plan plus Donald may wonder why his gouging plan isn't working unless he's planning on limiting our purchasing options as well.

We may as well just starve.

An economics degree is helpful, but not necessary to figure this out. Basic math and common sense is all it takes.

Economic efficiency is achieved when a product or service is produced or rendered at the lowest possible cost.

Examples:

It is much cheaper to grow oranges outdoors in tropical Florida than in Massachusetts' expensive greenhouses. This is due to Florida's favorable growing conditions, lower labor costs, and cost of living. So, we buy oranges from Florida.

The U.S. can import bamboo from Asia much more cheaply than it could be produced domestically, due to better growing conditions and cheap labor. So, we buy bamboo from Asia.

This forms the basis of trade.

The U.S. is currently importing billions more of these countries' products than it is exporting, creating a trade deficit and 8n some cases, violating trade agreements.

By imposing these tariffs, the price of THEIR goods will rise, not ours, which could spur a resurgence of U.S.-made goods and U.S.-grown food, potentially getting more Americans back to work.

Any retaliatory tariffs from these countries would hurt them much more than us, given the massive trade deficits.

Of course, to combat these tariffs, Canada, China, and Mexico COULD also move some manufacturing plants and jobs to (or back to) the U.S. and use U.S. workers. That would work!

Trump has an economics degree. Most of us don’t, but those of us who have mastered basic arithmetic and have badic common sense can figure out what he’s doing.

He wants to raise tariffs to 1. support the elimination of income tax, and 2. Incentivize businesses to return to manufacturing in the US. He’s also lowering taxes for businesses who manufacture in the US. You all need to stop misleading the public.

As much as it will hurt me and many here I would propose that any, (any) country, state or  sovereign  power to begin imposing tariffs on Trumps and Elons agenda. Trading with Trump is going to hurt and he is on a bender. All trades should include 25% or more from now on. Not reacting so much as acting to send a message.

MEXICO CAN PLAY STUPID GAMES AND WIN STUPID PRIZES :  In 2023, Mexico exported about 25.1 billion pounds of fresh produce to the United States, worth about $17.96 billion. Mexico is the largest source of fresh produce for the US.  Primarily they export to the US Tomatoes, Avocados, strawberries/raspberries. There are some other produce, but those 4 are the largest group.  WE CAN GROW  ALL OF THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE GOOD OLD USA.. MORE THAN ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF OUR NEEDS WITHOUT ANY GAMES BEING PLAYED LIKE RATIONING AND  STRESSING PEOPLE OUT!

What you didn't discuss is the effects that tarrifs have on industry and jobs. 

For example if China is allowed to wipe out the US auto industry what effect does that have on jobs, local industry ect... Yes you may get cheaper cars from china. But you can't buy a cheaper car if you don't have a job to pay for it.

What’s wrong with raising corporate tax through tariffs? Is everyone against taxing companies now because the “cost will pass onto the consumer?” If anything, this gives us an idea how useless corporate taxes are if the cost are simply passed down to the consumer

plz dont flame me but i do have a question: so if the tariffs are raised and it cost more for certain foreign goods would that mean more business for american brands/companies since people are most likely to switch over to a brand that is more affordable.Also if that does happen does that mean there will be an increase need to produce those products creating more jobs being open to meet the demand?

Tariffs are only passed on if I choose to buy the product its applied too. There are far too many like products being made elsewhere, that have no tariff, and will be cheaper. Which one do you think Americans will choose? The country with tafiffs imposed, their products will be uncompetive. It hurts the tariffed country far worse. I noticed that important point was left out of the video.

"I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that Trump's tariffs only affect big businesses. It's not that simple—these tariffs can trickle down to everyday consumers, impacting the prices of goods we buy regularly. I made the mistake of assuming tariffs were just a ""big business problem"" until I noticed my grocery bill creeping up."
"The words right out of ""The Don's"" mouth, 
""Tariffs are gona make us rich"" 
and ""us"" does not mean you the citizens!"
Tariffs translates into higher prices which ultimately gets passed onto the consumer.
"I'm a Canadian Conservative, and the fact that NBC News has to explain to the US electorate how tariffs work is rather thought provoking...and staggering. Vast difference between American and Canadian Conservativism."
"When this backfire, he call them Biden’s tariffs "
But the people voted for lower grocery prices.
As a canadien I will not buy anything that comes from the US
Tariffs pushed America into the great depression.
"Americans voted for Trump; therefore, they voted for tariffs.  Bumpy ride to come for the USA."
He forgot to mention that the extra revenue from tariffs can be used for tax cuts for wealthy individuals.
"TRUMP HAS LOST HIM MIND. Everyone that voted for him did it because he PROMISED LOWER PRICES, NOT HIGHER PRICES. Higher prices doesn't make average Americans rich Donald, UNDERSTAND THAT!"
American forever fool by Politicians.
The fools are gonna find out WHO pays the tariffs. We tried to warn them.
You must have looked really hard to find a pro tarrif economist. Economists almost universally consider them detrimental.
"Canadian eggs are cheaper than American eggs.,,. haha"
Tariffs will put us in a deep hole and we will never catch up. Dig in those wallets a little more folks.
So which US farms are gonna grow all the fruit and vegetables that we import?? And who is going to harvest that food??? Those people are gone. Farmers will not pay what Americans will demand to work out there. I live in South Texas… try working the fields when it’s 100 degrees outside. I never thought I’d live to see America die. I wish I had enough money to move somewhere that hasn’t been violated by Trump. He just r@pes everything he sees.
"Tariffs are a Tax, Companies Not Countries Pay The Tariff Tax, That TAX is often passed along to the consumer."
"Greed, that's trumps main concern, not the citizens of this country."
Wow he lied to us
"The wealthy elite rich, not the 99%of workers "
"“Who needs education? I let Trump do the thinking for me. If he says tariffs are good, they’re good. Everyone else just has TDS. I’m more concerned about what people have down their pants if they enter a public restroom or what they do in their bedroom.” "
"""If people pay more, thats tax revenue for the government"" 2:30

I thought republicans were supposed to focus on us paying less"
At least people making $300k+ will get tax cuts. 
Its sad that a lot of people don't understand how tariffs work. I asked my gop friends about tariffs and they don't know how tariffs work. They just heard trump talk about it lol. Fox News won't great it down for then.
"Technically, tariffs will only affect positively for US if, a Chinese parent company has a branch in US which imports goods and sells it by itself.. even so that local seller although from a chinese parent company is still someone who stays in US permanently and gets paid in US... If otherwise, the buyer is a US seller.. then it will only affect US people... literally squeezing more money from us.. What will such chinese branch companies now do? Find a 3rd party seller and pull out of US,.  So they won't be affected by tariffs..GG..

Also to counter the tariff... Sellers who face it like Best buy are not going to decrease chinese imports as its impossible... But to tackle it... They will raise the prices of native products too... Not just Samsung phones becoming 2000$ for example... But even expect iPhones to get expensive too... Wow... Chicken war again huh...

This means that since US domestic products are now initially expensive, they will be exported at that higher price too.. Foreign countries will see that higher prices of US goods... slowly shifting from buying them... therefore US exports going down... Even more pressure on the US people.. more taxes to sustain the economy... GG"
years ago i laughed at how stupid the UK was for brexit... $10 egg on my face now.
Why is NBC acting like the people wouldn't know that? The people wanted higher prices so they voted for higher prices
"Price of food will also go up with a 25% tariff that farmers will need to pay to purchase potash. The US produces potash in Utah and New Mexico,  but not enough to meet the demands of agriculture.  

So here are the countries that export potash to the US, Canada, with its low Canadian dollar compared to USD has the largest share. 

1. Canada – Canada is the dominant supplier, accounting for about 70-80% of U.S. potash imports. Saskatchewan, in particular, produces the bulk of this supply.


2. Russia – Russia has historically been the second-largest supplier, providing around 10-15% of U.S. imports, though this share has fluctuated in recent years due to sanctions and trade dynamics.


3. Belarus – Belarus typically supplies around 5-10% of U.S. potash imports.


4. Israel – Israel's share is smaller, contributing roughly 2-5% of the U.S. potash market.


5. Germany – Germany’s share is also smaller, around 1-2% of U.S. imports"
Trump belongs in prison.
"Closed Canadian USA border and Total Shut Down of Trade with The USA are beautiful words to a Canadian who wants Canadian Industry.
We will open up to the EU nations who have one after the other come for our oul and gas and been obstructed by the Whitehouse and Wall st
Canada is the producer of the lowest cost electricity in the world on both coasts and its sold to the USA we need this for for us,not USA."
Who will pay for the tariffs? You and I will pay for it? I don’t know why people are so happy about this raising the tariffs strategy?
25% tariff means 35-40% price increases to consumers
"He put terrifs on steel and aluminum last time around to safe 30.000 steel jobs in the US, only to lose a 170.000 jobs across different industries effected by higher prices. Good luck America, you need it because it is all downhill from here on out"
Even the pro-tariffs guy admits that it's basically a tax on the working class
"lol... I love these rich people saying who cares about higher prices, get more revenue for the country... man shut up."
"""Groceries... such a bootiful werd......"""
"Enjoy the price of gas going up at least 50% in the Midwest overnight, because the Canadian trade deficit comes entirely from energy exports."
"Make ""us"" meaning "" me "" trump rich"
The world is laughing with Trump's tariff policy.
The worst part are retroactive tariffs (illegal) for already existing inventory.
"Sorry US…..you thought you voted for lower costs…..you voted an imbecile into office TWICE and now this is what you get! We in Canada will fight with everything we have……like energy, critical minerals, steel, etc. We’ve got what you need and way more land to develop here. Buckle up!"
"Sign an executive order forcing chickens to lay more eggs, Sir"
If my paycheck get stretched even more I might just have to evict my landlord.
I can't believe people voted for this 
"So, taxes. He means taxes on Americans."

"If tariffs imposed by President Trump primarily harm Americans, wouldn't retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico similarly harm Canadians and Mexicans?"
Get rid of income tax and replace it with a national sales tax and tariffs.
"When Trump supporters discover that ChatGPT's monthly fee has tripled, they will finally realize that all Trump knows how to do is simply increase tariffs, causing prices to skyrocket, and nothing else."
"Tariff = Tax
Import Tariff = Import Tax

Taxes are paid in country that receives goods to Government by business or individuals in that country.

Made in country products may also have components from international countries.

Any increase in cost (tax) to acquire products or components from any source will be passed onto consumers, which increases the cost of goods.

Trying to incentivise manufacturing in country by increasing taxes on imported goods, the cost of that process is paid by the consumer."
So what is the cost of eggs now?
"Here are America's trading partners, and their total imports of American made goods, divided by their populations. You can reach your conclusions about the numbers. I do think it is hard to conclude that Canada is not America's greatest trading partner, but please come to your own conclusions. 

China - $147.81 Billion/1.411 Billion people = $105 US per citizen

Europe - $368.76 Billion/742.3 Million people = $497 US per citizen

Japan - $76.15 Billion/124.5 Million people = $612 US per citizen

UK - $74.05 Billion/68.35 Million people = $1,083 US per citizen

Australia - $33.7 Billion/26.64 Million people = $1,265 US per citizen

South Korea - $87.8 Billion/51.71 Million people = $1,698 US per citizen

Mexico - $323.23 Billion/128.5 Million people = $2,515 US per citizen

Canada - $352.76 Billion/40.1 Million people = $8,797 US per citizen"
"We were promised that the price of gas was to drop by $1.00 per gallon the day after tRump got elected, has it?"
Well the government was shocked when stimulus payments were used to pay bills and not buy luxuries to boost the economy. Likewise intelligent people will learn to economize when prices go up. If people were smart they would stick together and this will not go as planned. Elonia has already said we'll have to suffer. Make sure they feel it too.

Tarrriffs and no income tax.

"This is disgusting as the people are going to suffer. This man has made a lot of money since he's been in office however, the people will suffer. Eggs are now between $5-$10 dollars. We are in big trouble. I feel horrible for the elderly, disabled, poor working class, veterans, etc...."
"Invest into commodities, you know the prices are going to go up"
Increased cost of living in all countries. That's what oligarchy wants.
"Over the years, millions of American jobs have been outsourced due to NAFTA, impacting various industries and contributing to the global outsourcing market.
Trump has been critical of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) for years, arguing that it led to job losses and trade imbalances for the U.S. Raising tariffs can lead to more jobs coming back to the U.S. by encouraging companies to manufacture goods locally.
I didn't vote for Trump, but I'm with him on this issue. This is long overdue."
U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico totaled an estimated $855.1 billion in 2022. Exports were $362.0 billion; imports were $493.1 billion. The U.S. goods and services trade deficit with Mexico was $131.1 billion in 2022.
Millionaires and Billionaires need imaginative ways to extract more and more money and respurces out of people who are already poor.
"Don't let prejudice and arrogance blinds you.
Tariff is not panacea, that's why many countries seek tariff-free agreement on specific procucts.  Because reduce tariff can lower price and increase sells.  
Though the American market is important, there is still other countries.  If America increases tariff but other countries like European or Asian, African does not.  The TSMC can increase price for American buyers while reducing price for other countries, then the American companies will be fail to compete with Chinese companies and the CPI will soar up."
America needs to include tariffs on American companies that outsource jobs to countries like India and the Philippines!
"are allies get tariffs , but russia gets nothing"
"Tariffs on imported goods are not paid by the country exporting them. Plain and simple. They are paid by the company importing them, and in turn, raise the cost of goods landed and used to calculate the retail sales price higher to offset the tariff applied. China is not paying your tariffs, America. You are. Just want to be clear."
This did not explain tariffs. Is it any wonder people are so confused? Good grief.
"The tariffs   increase the prices for customers .
But the lower prices from competitors bringing concurrency to the market, making the  manufacturers rethink the way profit making by not only reducing the production cost but also in terms that they can loose the market and and this return the production back to US and paying taxes in US. 
So why NBC  do not explain that, do they have only partial knowledge or maybe they know just how to consume?"
"Why can't any news source come talk about the nature of this regressive tax?  The super rich (the ones making the policy) will hardly get hit at all. The middle / working class will pay for this and poor will pay the most.  Florida uses the same type of tax system. The poor pay 13% of their income to pay for the states needs, the rich pay less then 3%.  That is how consumption taxes work - the working people and poor pay the most, the rich pay hardly anything - a few %. 

Tariffs are a source of revenue for the government and a consumption tax. Those making the laws will pay 1-3% and we the people will pay the rest.  Those in power are pushing the tax burden squarely onto the back of we the people and away from themselves. 

When will ANY news station talk about it like that? I care more about that part of this more than what I see on the news."
"Canada has more beef, more oil, more gas, more lumber, and more steel than what they consume. It's the exact opposite in the US, so you do the math. 
How about Yanks pay fair, retail price for Cdn natural gas?! They are currently getting it below wholesale price and almost the entire US economy is running on dirt cheap Cdn gas, including the NBC building you are sitting in ! Several countries already expressed interest in Cdn gas, like Japan & Greece.  
Watch what happens when US hospitals, homes, schools go cold. It's still Winter out, so brace for the shivers"
It’s gonna make “us billionaires” rich
I'll take more jobs in the US over enabling modern slavery.
"funny that even American companies have their products produced abroad so if people believe local products is safe, well, think again"
this is what it will take to get our country back. we just went through 4 years of intense out of control prices. oh and your just upset this guy will be living in your head rent free for the next four years 
"Let’s just love each other, can’t we all just get along?"
The people will pay them all
"As a Canadian, I'm glad to hear we can finally sell our energy to the USA at fair market value instead of the deep discount we have been giving you all these years."
US can’t manufacture any darn thing??? Are these people serious?
"would love to see how the tariffs will be used to ""reduce the deficit"" lol"
"2:28 To reduce other taxes, to reduce deficit... There is no logic in this. If tariffs go higher, taxes get lower deficit will be more or less the same. Also whenever it is possible and more profitable goods will be imported from some other country without tariffs."
How about you keep your hands out of my wallet
"You just start tax/tariffing USA tech companies (Twitter/X, Microsoft, Oracle, Google, OpenAI, Apple, nVidia, Facebook, etc.) same way and problem resolved, its really that easy. And since USA have to import almost everything (because USA corporations don't want to pay expensive local work force because of high standard and outsource everything from needle to locomotive), unfortunately ordinary USA people will have everything even more expensive. Tariffs are double-edge sword and Trump is hawkish business man, strong on words but soft when argumentatively confronted."
"It's true that citizens don't benefit. But if America can't have it good why should anyone? That's why we need someone to at least show this, like Trump is doing."
Tariffs are going to raise prices for a bit. But the return is going to be huge in a few years. Its going to push companies to start manufacturing and push them to be made in America . Cheaper prices more jobs faster for the supply chain and more taxes. Win win
"People can't say they weren't warned. So many warned them not to vote for Trump- economists, environmentalists, foreign policy experts, most of his former staffers for G sake... but people apparently need to learn the hard way. They deserve any pain they're about to experience."
"As long as tariffs are offset by an abolishment or drastic reduction of income taxes, then they may be feasible."
So why does America pay tariffs to EU and china
who here after the Colombian incident?
Canada imports 63% of its goods from the us and exports 73% of its goods to the us. Where as the us only receives 14% of its goods from canada and exports 18% of its goods to canada. Massive leverage on that end. The mexico side isn't as scewed but is still heavy in the US's favor. The trade war won't last long.
"Border issues.... the US southern border is the main problem. The US-Canada border, with whatever problems exist, is nothing in comparison to the border with Mexico, yet somehow Canada needs to be punished. Trump has every right to criticize allies for not spending enough on their militaries etc...but this tariff issue is ridiculous. Trudeau deserves every bit of criticism, worst PM we ever had on many issues, and he invited people to run across the border when Trump announce deportations the last time and shouldn't have."
"Whelp...this is what a lot of you voted for! It's just a shame I have to endure it with you. Sorry, Canada and Mexico. We didnt all fall for this clown."
MEANS IF I EARN 5000 I KEEP 5000 BUT SINCE TARIF THE EGG NOW FROM LET SAY 5 DOLLAR BECOME 10 DOLLAR
but my favourite influencers said trump is good :(
"But But my eggs.

"I just did a quick google search and I guess the USA is in global trade deficit because of MEXICO, CANDA, and CHINA - it's not bad or good I guess etc. But those 3 countries rely on the USA ALOT (before people say not China, USA is their biggest costumer, so they DO rely alot on USA). I guess from the reading etc, alot of countries rely on the USA because we buy ""everything"" but can't  sell alot. Long story short - USA is making other countries rich by buying their stuff & other countries don't really buy US stuff much which makes USA poorer.  

 Driscolls/Taylor Farms  are grown in USA not imported with some google searches etc. I know in the summer truckers pick up from SALINAS CA and winter YUMA AZ truck loads of fresh food,  there's alot of info on this online maybe. Possibly the media (democrat or republican) just covers the worst side etc, to make the party (democrat or republican) look bad to divide the citizens."
Good luck getting fresh produce in the winter.  It all comes from south of the border.  Better plant you a garden or stock up on vitamins and fiber supplements....oh wait RFK will get rid of those too.  Hello scurvy
Trump needs tariffs to pay off his support...
"High tariffs were a means not only of protecting infant industries, but of generating revenue for the federal government. They were also a mainstay of the Republican Party, which dominated the Washington political scene after the Civil War. After the Democrats, who supported freer trade, captured Congress and the White House in the elections of 1910 and 1912, the stage was set for a change in tariff policy. 

IN USA beginning... THERE WAS NO INCOME TAXES... NO FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. GOVT WAS PAID FOR BY TARRIFS"
"This will enrich the people who benefit most from tax breaks, the already wealthy people. They will enrich themselves by taking the tax money in the form of tariffs from the average American citizen."
id rather spend more on my spending rather than be taxed on MY earnings. I choose what I spend it on or to save. cant save if its taken from me before I even get it.
"@ 2:14 ""the guy states there was an effect on prices. A lot of the time it was short lived.""

How was it short lived when prices keep going up? Meat skyrocketed in price during the last tarrif exchange. Prices haven't come down. Economists state we are in a place of deflation but prices don't come down. Stop using words that make it sound like things benefit the middle class in reality prices remain high, go higher, or stays steady for a bit and then...go higher. They don't come down!

Or am I mistaken?"
This is what yall wanted 
Just as long as the ultra wealthy don't have to pay their fair share I mean just look around aren't we proud to be America today and this is only going to make it so much more fun
"I'm still trying to learn and understand how these things work.

 I could be mistaken, but this seems like a way to increase taxes without actually increasing the usual taxes such as income tax. Because the government needs more money, but saying that taxes are going up would mean the end of anyone's political career. 

So you increase tariffs and keep other taxes the same. Or even cut taxes. The people are happy because they don't understand the impact to them.

Only thing I'm not sure about is how much of a difference they make to people compared to just raising taxes.

Also just my personal opinion, but at least they can be used in negotiation with other countries. Instead of just raising taxes on your own people with no other benefit.

Unless the product you're imposing the tariff on has just one supplier with a complete monopoly, then the market should keep prices in control. I think. Tbh probably not."
"Every country has tariff tool, why Trump so fascinating about it."
USA is going to end up being very rich.
Trump ️
"Yeah but we're going to do whatever we can to avoid paying on goods with 'high costs'  This is going to have it's own follow through plan plus Donald may wonder why his gouging plan isn't working unless he's planning on limiting our purchasing options as well.

We may as well just starve."
Could??? You mean WILL
What about NAFTA?
Yall voted for him xD
"An economics degree is helpful, but not necessary to figure this out. Basic math and common sense is all it takes.

Economic efficiency is achieved when a product or service is produced or rendered at the lowest possible cost.

Examples:

It is much cheaper to grow oranges outdoors in tropical Florida than in Massachusetts' expensive greenhouses. This is due to Florida's favorable growing conditions, lower labor costs, and cost of living. So, we buy oranges from Florida.

The U.S. can import bamboo from Asia much more cheaply than it could be produced domestically, due to better growing conditions and cheap labor. So, we buy bamboo from Asia.

This forms the basis of trade.

The U.S. is currently importing billions more of these countries' products than it is exporting, creating a trade deficit and 8n some cases, violating trade agreements.

By imposing these tariffs, the price of THEIR goods will rise, not ours, which could spur a resurgence of U.S.-made goods and U.S.-grown food, potentially getting more Americans back to work.

Any retaliatory tariffs from these countries would hurt them much more than us, given the massive trade deficits.

Of course, to combat these tariffs, Canada, China, and Mexico COULD also move some manufacturing plants and jobs to (or back to) the U.S. and use U.S. workers. That would work!

Trump has an economics degree. Most of us don’t, but those of us who have mastered basic arithmetic and have badic common sense can figure out what he’s doing."
dw this will help the egg prices........ go up......
Could?....WILL
"He wants to raise tariffs to 1. support the elimination of income tax, and 2. Incentivize businesses to return to manufacturing in the US. He’s also lowering taxes for businesses who manufacture in the US. You all need to stop misleading the public."
Smart man
Bing Bong 
"As much as it will hurt me and many here I would propose that any, (any) country, state or  sovereign  power to begin imposing tariffs on Trumps and Elons agenda. Trading with Trump is going to hurt and he is on a bender. All trades should include 25% or more from now on. Not reacting so much as acting to send a message."
SANE WASHING
"MEXICO CAN PLAY STUPID GAMES AND WIN STUPID PRIZES :  In 2023, Mexico exported about 25.1 billion pounds of fresh produce to the United States, worth about $17.96 billion. Mexico is the largest source of fresh produce for the US.  Primarily they export to the US Tomatoes, Avocados, strawberries/raspberries. There are some other produce, but those 4 are the largest group.  WE CAN GROW  ALL OF THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE GOOD OLD USA.. MORE THAN ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF OUR NEEDS WITHOUT ANY GAMES BEING PLAYED LIKE RATIONING AND  STRESSING PEOPLE OUT!"
"What you didn't discuss is the effects that tarrifs have on industry and jobs. 

For example if China is allowed to wipe out the US auto industry what effect does that have on jobs, local industry ect... Yes you may get cheaper cars from china. But you can't buy a cheaper car if you don't have a job to pay for it."

"What’s wrong with raising corporate tax through tariffs? Is everyone against taxing companies now because the “cost will pass onto the consumer?” If anything, this gives us an idea how useless corporate taxes are if the cost are simply passed down to the consumer"
plz dont flame me but i do have a question: so if the tariffs are raised and it cost more for certain foreign goods would that mean more business for american brands/companies since people are most likely to switch over to a brand that is more affordable.Also if that does happen does that mean there will be an increase need to produce those products creating more jobs being open to meet the demand?
brazil look
Too sick
"Tariffs are only passed on if I choose to buy the product its applied too. There are far too many like products being made elsewhere, that have no tariff, and will be cheaper. Which one do you think Americans will choose? The country with tafiffs imposed, their products will be uncompetive. It hurts the tariffed country far worse. I noticed that important point was left out of the video."
Couldn’t be worse than biden.
Justin Trudeau has already done that. There is nothing left to take
"Hmmm.    So China, Fiji, Bahamas, Cayman, Belize,  can make tariffs work for them, but we can't?"
MEANS NO TAX TO AMERICAN  BUT TARIFF IS THE MAX TO THE  OTHER COUNTRY
Trump is the man who invented the word tariffs 
https://youtu.be/3Eooypa3SkQ?si=NdvViS-IkjS5VcxA a class on tariffs
Simple question: how is the trade balance between the US and Europe?
Nah it’s over man welcome to fallout
Very good USA 
Tariffs should be the governments only form of income
"As for saving the planet go to India and China for that 
I am sick of the hundreds of billlions of tax dollars flushed down the drain for the electric cars and car companies. IF THEY CAN COMPETE WITH OUT GOVERNMENTS TAX MONEY THEN GO FOR IT."
All I'm buying is food and household cleaning products. It's domestic.

YES ! I voted for President Trump and glad of it.  I believe God has given him the wisdom to prosper this country.  I believe that God chose him and will guide him in his decisions.  I have faith in God.  Faith is when you don't pay attention to the storm but to God.

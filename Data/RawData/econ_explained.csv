6:40 this is the critical bit. The tariffs establish a new price baseline, even for domestic goods in that category. Even if the tariff goes away, the price has been permanently raised.

Small business owner here: Tariffs on the things I buy (my cookbooks, and a few other things) are printed in China through a Chicago based company.

When I looked locally for printing services, the price was 3x. If the price had been 1.5x I would have considered it, but 3x is too much. Most people won't pay $50 for a cook book and I don't want to charge that.

I just got a notice from the company we work with that I'm being charged another 10% on my next shipment as a ""just in case"". I don't have a choice here, I just have to eat the cost.

I'm not raising my price on goods, just eating the cost. This hurts small businesses.

Don't get me started on groceries and cost of foods. Chef friends I know are incredibly worries.

The biggest issue that wasn't addressed is that companies need to believe that the tariffs will be stable long term.

Avocado trees grown from seed can take anywhere from 5 to 15 years—or even longer—to bear fruit, while grafted trees typically produce fruit within 2 to 3 years. However, some trees may never produce fruit at all. So, if you’re planning to grow your own, good luck with that.  

Now, let’s talk about something even more essential—coffee. The U.S. consumes a staggering 54 billion tons of coffee per year but produces only 11.2 billion tons, leaving a massive gap that must be filled through imports. The U.S. sources coffee from countries like Canada, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and Indonesia. I’m all for strengthening American industries, but we’re stepping into an economic battle without the necessary resources. In the short term, this is going to hurt—a lot. Hopefully, your job isn’t on the chopping block when the dust settles.  

Will this strategy pay off in the long run? That’s a tough call. Look at North Korea—we forced them into self-reliance, but at what cost? Russia tried to isolate itself from the global economy, yet after three years, they still haven’t managed to take over a much smaller neighboring country. And then there’s the UK—ask them how Brexit is going. The results of economic isolation aren’t exactly promising. Maybe this will work out, but we’re taking a huge gamble.  

Launching an economic war without the proper preparation—without the ""armor and weapons,"" so to speak—was reckless. There had to be a smarter way to approach this.  

The U.S. relies heavily on imports for essential goods, including fruits and vegetables. Mexico, for example, supplies a significant portion of our tomatoes, berries, and avocados. It’s easy to say, “We’ll just grow it ourselves,” but reality isn’t that simple. Growing food at scale requires the right climate, soil conditions, labor force, and infrastructure. Certain crops, like coffee and avocados, thrive in specific environments that the U.S. simply doesn’t have in abundance. Even if we could expand domestic production, the costs would be much higher, and the supply wouldn’t be able to meet demand overnight.  

It’s not just about whether we  grow it—it’s about whether we can do so efficiently, affordably, and at the scale needed to sustain the economy.

Tariffs only work when the domestic labor is cheap and there is a need to protect developing domestic manufacturer.  That is how South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan developed their industry.  But, the U.S. labor is expensive and there is no need to protect already competitive American manufacturers.  The tariff will worsen the inflation and hurt the American people.

There's also this naive belief that large scale manufacturing in the U.S will create a bunch of new jobs. The reality is when building new facilities in the U.S the cost of labor makes mass automation far more attractive and the desire to make energy prices cheaper only motivates this even more.

Great video! As an economics professor here in Brazil, I'm very familiarized with those consequences of tariffs. It's hard to impose a developmental program on tariffs these days, Brazil has many examples where it didn't work AND nowadays, we are suffering from one of those old days protections: coffee inflation, we are used to coffee surplus but last year we have a dramatic reduction in coffee production to internal market and import it is expensive because tariffs. Brazilians can't dispense coffee from our routine consumption (it is very inelastic), even breakfast here is called: ""café da manhã"" (""coffee of the morning"" in a literal translation).

Remember that the subsidies to 'farmers' that cost as much as the tariffs were bringing in went overwhelmingly to big agribusiness -- not to family farms.  It effectively taxed all Americans, resulting in higher consumer prices, while paying out billions to the richest Americans.  This was the plan all along -- tax all Americans and funnel that money to the richest Americans.

Looks like we got the answer to this one pretty quickly. Yes, tariffs apparently work as a political bargaining chip to bring a foreign country to the table. I would say they work effectively, given that it took all of one day for Canada and Mexico to come to the table and agree to Trump's initial terms in order to get a temporary stay on the tariffs.

Tariff is an economic tool that is used to protect a sector which is important to national security of the country. Trump is betting that Canada and Mexico will capitulate under pressure from American tariff. Problem is that tariff will impact American consumers and industry as well. If Canada and Mexico resolve is strong and want to stand against America then Trump will taste a bitter defeat as his campaign promise was reduction of inflation.

A topic not covered, but extremely important is that the impact (the pain) on consumers is inversely proportional to their wealth.

It's yet another ""tax on the poor"" ...

As an American expat living in Brazil, which has a lot of protectionist policies and tariffs, I can say as a consumer that I am left with poor quality yet expensive products from national brands for electronics.  Somehow Samsung and LG have an exception to be here in some categories, so we can get good TVs and washing machines, but small kitchen electronics and even things like fans are expensive and made of cheap plastic.  One thing I noticed when I first moved here was that protein powder was expensive.  It turns out protein powder was subject to a luxury tax lumped with things like jet skis to protect the local market.  A few years ago I think they were going to get rid of the tariff on protein powder and the local dairy industry protested because whey is a byproduct that provides a nice income stream and they wanted to keep the protections.  Also, the protein market is dominated by whey-- it is very hard to get soy or other types of protein powder, again because whey is a byproduct of a large dairy industry.   I think tariffs only work if it is tapered over a set period of time to give the local industry time to catch up.  If they are in place indefinitely, companies don't innovate and get efficient (and are incentivized to be greedy and keep prices high), and consumers get inferior products that are expensive.

Well, first things first. Putting tariffs on your  political and economical allies is just dumb.

The tariffs on computer chips from Taiwan (TSMC) without having a comparable chip manufacturing here in the states is just suicide.

Intel sucks. They sucked so much in their own fabs, they started to outsource to TSMC. And TSMC has plants being built in AZ, but they won't even be staffed until mid 2025 and won't start to produce until 2026. And even then, the fab is a fraction of what exists in Taiwan.

It's like quitting a job with no unemployment and no job lined up. It's just stupid. These tariffs are dumb but man, if you're gonna do it, you could at least wait to do it until we have it stateside.

That point about income tax not existing until 1910 has A LOT MORE to do with the fact that US gov did not provide most services we associate it with today, they did a lot less so they needed a lot less hence no need for income tax. Nowadays tariffs could never be enough to provide everything you are used to, from public weather forecast, skilled firefighting and police forces, and the large subsidies on everything from corn, beef, apples to automotive industry. They sure did not have public airports and metro (first NYC metro actually opened in 1904 but it was private at the time) and they sure did not bail out their banks and carmakers time and time again. THAT is the real reson.

For a long time, the U.S. got most of its money from tariffs, but as the country grew and needed more cash for things like infrastructure and social programs, tariffs weren’t cutting it anymore. By 1913, with the 16th Amendment, they introduced income tax, which made raising money way simpler and fairer—especially since it could target higher earners more. This move basically ended America’s heavy reliance on tariffs and opened up the door to a bigger government role in the economy. Going back to tariffs ONLY suits the richer people and would require a massive cut in government spending. Tariffs swapped in against lower progressive income tax are a flat tax rate which is particularly rough on the lower 80% of earners suiting only at best the top 20% and more likely the top 5% of earners.

If most Americans recognized that a tariff is a tax, I wonder if they would still be on board for it. ""My taxes are too high, they should be lower! Except when I buy groceries, appliances, gas and cars, then they should be higher!!!""

Many people here have a lot of complaints about Tariffs before we even see what effects they have. Since many other countries use Tariffs we cannot complain that they extreme or somehow unfair. It is also glaringly clear that no one else has any plan of a better way to either repatriate industry or to ensure that companies that sell products in the US to follow US labor and environmental laws. I don't know if Tariffs will work but I see nothing from anyone else here. Saying it can't be done is defeatist and unhelpful. Come up with an alternative plan.

There’s no need to overcomplicate things. The simplest explanation is that the cost of maintaining a global empire has begun to outweigh its benefits for the U.S., prompting it to retract its sphere of influence. To preserve as much of its original interests as possible during this retraction, it has resorted to imposing tariffs and maintaining the dollar’s dominance. In the foreseeable future, however, the era of dollar hegemony will inevitably end, and the U.S. will transition into a continental empire in the Americas.

This is a much simpler way of looking at it:
Tariff → Higher Costs for Importers (Local companies buying international goods)
Enough Tariffs → Domestic Manufacturing Becomes More Competitive (Reduces imported goods)
Local Manufacturing Expansion → More Jobs & Higher Wages (Potentially)
Higher Wages → More Spending Power
More Money in the Economy → Higher Prices Become Manageable

Additionally, Tariffs hurt importing companies that are taking advantage of a much richer country and essentially draining their wealth.
As long as you are invested in the American economy or working in it, tariffs will not hurt you in the slightest.

You can't ""encourage entrepreneurs"" to grow certain food products in a part of the world where the plants are unable to grow. Unless we are going to turn Hawaii back into a series of plantations -- which was horribly unjust to the indigenous people already there -- or do the same to island territories that are part of the USA, we cannot grow coffee beans, cocoa beans, pineapple, etc. domestically . Yes, there are some areas in California and the south where we can grow avocados and citrus fruits, and what not -- but they are already pretty much spoken for. 

And until American companies are willing to pay American wages for manufacturing again, those jobs aren't coming back either, tariffs or not

The rising rates can be attributed to increasing imports and decreasing exports, largely due to the Trump-era tariffs, which triggered retaliatory measures. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in the banking crisis, given its policies of quantitative tightening and higher interest rates. If these conditions persist, something will eventually give. With this in mind, is it really a good time to have savings invested in stocks?

Honestly, where tariffs become most enticing is the idea that the income tax could be significantly reduced or eliminated at the federal level. 
Tariffs are by their nature for the average citizen a tax on how they want to live, you can avoid a tariff by not buying the product. Or (In some cases) buying domestic. A tax on income is a tax on producing something in the economy and is unavoidable, what's more, funding the government on tariffs would eliminates the need for income tax returns.

Here is one thing nobody is ever talking about: price control comes down to the consumers in the end. Everyone is complaining that prices are going to go up because businesses have higher costs now, however the only reason why the prices go up due to this is because of corporate greed who would rather destroy a family and their livelihoods than to decrease their yearly salary. you know 1 billion sounds much better than 900 million. If the customer refuses to purchase what these companies are selling, then now they are forced to drop prices. If they fire people to do it, it will come to a limit since they all have a minimum of employees needed to ensure the production of their goods. aka you can make a product without people to make it. finally leading them to decrease their costs in the only place left, their own pockets. Boycotting works. people today are just weak and comfortable. fighting each other instead of fighting the big boys.

Tarrifs work when we actually produce more products than we export. We need to make more products here in the US (quality products) and and give those products better tax breaks. The better we make things we more people will buy them. Yet if outsourced products are better and cost less tarrifs just make good products more expensive.

I remember back in the 90s made in America was something that mattered. Heck back then I was a Walmart shopper because they promoted their made in America products. Today I avoid Walmart because almost everything is an import.

To regain our dominance in this world we need to produce products that the world want to buy.

I think you've missed a major economic factor of unemployment rate. With the current US very low unemployment rate of 4.1% tariffs are more likely to backfire since there is very few people available to increase production, thus already high labor costs are likely to only increase. Tariffs make much more sense in an economy where there is lots of people looking for work.

The thing that conversations tend to miss is that we actually need significant inflation at the moment to keep the Federal debt from snowballing. No one likes that, but in light of the fact that inflation is necessary and inevitable and complex supply chains are already breaking under international tension, tariffs make a lot of sense. The pain is inevitable, the question is if your local industry will be anywhere close to a position to pick up the slack.

I cannot tell you how much i despise economic thinking in this day and age. We act like we know everything and then immediately forget about it. This is simple. Tariffs do things, they have pressures, you have to account for those pressures for a tariff or literally any other thing to be accomplished adequately. There. Inflation is an upward pressure. Deflation is a downward pressure. There are steps to achieve either, but we act like we don't know how to do that. The truth is, everyone is a coward. Too scared to say sometimes growth isn't good if it doesn't map to two things. One, real growth, two, human well being.

I was once in the OEM sales department of one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers, handling the sale of parts to some of the world's largest car makers' manufacturing operations in the EU. Although I only had very small pieces of some very big pies, I was dealing with tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers from about 15 different countries... Many of those parts had commonality with those OEM's models in the US. Also dealing with the logistics side of things, it was crazy to see, first hand, just how many different pieces from every corner of the world have to fall in place before a car even starts its journey on the assembly line. I saw Brexit kill some of my customers' operations, so I'm fearful about what happens in the US if these tariffs stay in long term (especially as I now work for a US-bases manufacturing concern).

Around the 11-minute mark, EE starts to briefly go off the rails, saying 'well, we know that tariffs were horrible for the US the last time, but you never know....maybe there's some secret benefits we'll only see years later, based on zero evidence.' Him also talking about Stellantis as a positive automotive conglomerate is hilarious for multiple reasons: 1. It is not a domestic U.S. conglomerate, it was a merger w/ Dodge, Jeep, Chrystler, and several European automakers including Pugeaut. 2. Demand for their vehicles, especially Jeeps, has plummeted, as you can see from Dodges and Jeeps both being THE BOTTOM TWO slowest-selling cars off the lot, as a verifiable fact. 3. The first thing the Stellantis CEO did was announce sweeping pay cuts and layoffs to U.S. workers; More Perfect Union has a great video documenting this, and 4. The quality for Jeeps has cratered, but their MSRPs went up 15+%. He recovers soon after this, but I think he needs to do his due diligence and not make up a steel-man w/ no evidence to attempt to ""both-sides"" this. As an American, I can confirm we're pissed about these tariffs.

Tariffs primarily impact consumers by leading to higher prices on imported goods, as companies often pass increased costs down the supply chain. While this can create financial strain for consumers in the short term, it may also encourage more mindful spending habits. The high rate of consumerism in the U.S., characterized by frequent purchases of items like new cars and smartphones, contributes to resource overuse and economic dependence on foreign manufacturing. Tariffs could potentially reduce this overconsumption by making imported goods more expensive, thereby promoting longer product lifecycles and supporting domestic industries.

they say that theyre going to tax corporations less which will reduce prices of the items they sell because they’ll be able to sell stuff for less with the same profit margins, but they’re doing the exact opposite with tariffs by increasing the companies costs pushing the prices up, and at the end of it all, corporations dont lose any money, and we have to pay more because of the tariffs

Something that is often overlooked is the impact on currency. If the us dollar increases as a result of tarrifs and others decrease (as mexico and Canadas has  already) this helps US purchasing power of OS goods.

Companies in targetted country always eats some of the tarrif as well, particullarly when the market in the US is so lucrative.

Economists don’t differentiate between the economy and its workers. If stocks go up because jobs get exported, economists say that’s good. Tariffs are meant to protect domestic industry from external cheap labor and prevent jobs being exported.

Running an appliance repair business. Those 2018 tariffs hurt our industry pretty bad. 
It wasn’t just China. South Korea as well. I’ve makers for LG frenchdoor fridges went from $60 to $240 in like one day. If those tariffs worked then lg would have seen a smaller market share in appliances, but their market share grew in the period following those tariffs. It did nothing, because we produce nothing to little to satisfy demand.

I understand it is difficult to grasp, but tariffs are not there for their short-term effect. They are there to push change to the local industry and that can take decades to happen. Especially in western countries who have grown complacent and have forgotten how to manufacture basic products.

yes, indeed, and we have seen them work within the last day. Both Mexico and Canada have acquiesced to Trump‘s recommendations and has lift for 30 days in order to see if these two countries were making progress with their agreements. One interesting point is with the agreement concerning Mexico, Trump needs to stop or significantly reducethe flow of high-powered weapons from the USA to the Mexican cartels. It will be interesting to see if he can get this done. Either way, this is all working out for the benefit of the American people.

Tariffs great for the wealthy, and not for mid and lower income households. Businesses have never pass the savings on to their customers. It just means they get to keep more money if capital income taxes are removed.

Great video. One thing kinda glossed over was it matters what country is being impacted and what we import from them. In this case we are using tariffs as a strong arm move to give us negotiating power. Because the US can withstand the import losses where as Canada and Mexico will struggle. This is meant to push china out while putting pressure on mexico and canda for future relations and negotiations.

Another issue with regard to tariffs is the impact on labor alternatives.   The US economy is a highly diverse economy, with world leading service, information and finance sectors.  Unemployment in manufacturing intensive regions is low, particularly in newly industrialized areas with modernized facilities like the US Carolinas and in Texas.  In these areas, the biggest concern for manufacturers is the availability of workers, when a production worker can receive equivalent compensation in the service sector.   The fed has shown that the wage premium for production workers no longer exists.   So a raise in tariffs would raise the competition for production workers to meet increased demand.   This would drive up the price of workers in all sectors.   As Friedman noted: a tariff is a tax on the many for the benefit of the few.

This video gets all the right points. For the tariffs to work, local production must also be there are is competitive with imports after pricing adjustments.

The US currently lacks this, and any local manufacturing most likely still won't be competitive with imports after tariffs.

In short, this is just a tax on the public and little else.

Good to see a proper take on tarrifs. What you said about domestic industry needing to be competitive if tarrifs are used is precisely why ""Trust busting"" was a thing. Monopolies and cartels are bad for a market and they develop far faster when a country's industry is protected. To maximize the benefits of tarrifs you need to combine it with anti trust legislation. Generally, tarrifs on raw materials for example are really bad for an economy as they're a major business input. They serve more industries than it would protect. This again means that if you actually look at what industries a tarrif protects (the taxed industry) and the industries that rely on that you can see pretty clearly if it'll be a net positive for the economy. Also for tariffs to work they need to blanket. The only countries not hit by the tarrif should not be hit because they are economically similar and directly coordinating with your country. Otherwise they'll just be circumvented and everyone loses.

Tariffs also play well to a domestic audience. Threaten a tariff, exact a minor concession, and then exalt the purported political gains at home. It’s naive to think that Trump doesn’t understand the inflationary impacts and, frankly, stupid to think that he would risk a politically disastrous inflationary outbreak. 

Take Mexico. He threatened tariffs, negotiated a “last minute” political accommodation from Mexico on border control, and will now claim that he achieved more in four days than Biden achieved in four years. This will play well politically.

I don't know. People have been complaining about wage stagnation for a long time now. Tariffs should theoretically work in bringing jobs back domestically increasing the demand of domestic labor, theoretically increasing the cost of labor meaning wages should go up. Frankly even with all the issues outlined in the video this seems like a better angle than artificially increasing minimum wage which compresses the wages of jobs but doesn't necessarily raise them all. Min wage also reduces manufacturing in the US as well as almost all of economic history suggesting price floors are bad.

The problem with these calculations is that almost everything ""made in the USA"" uses imported raw materials, components, or sub-assemblies. That means that tariffs make domestic goods less competitive and more expensive as well as imported goods. Global supply chains have become so interdependent that almost nothing is ""made in"" a single country.

When a tariff is imposed, jobs are NOT magically created. In fact, according to Henry Hazzlitt and other economists, the jobs are simply redirected to the industries where the tariff is being imposed. Consumers must spend more money on the increased prices for that specific industry, thus decreasing the amount of money they can spend on other products. This means that businesses in other American industries suffer, decreasing the number of jobs there. In conclusion, tariffs don't create jobs, they simply move jobs from a more efficient domestic industry to a less efficient one.

I have some questions. Isn't the point of tariffs to encourage more companies to manufacture in the US, which would improve our industry, create jobs, and make us less dependent on foreign manufacturing? I'm not sure there's anyone arguing that tariffs are intended to drive consumer end prices down. Also, and we will have to wait and see what happens, but isnt the other intention of tariffs to replace our current federal funding mechanism? Like, reduce or eliminate income tax and revert back to pre 1913? I'm all for spending a little more on goods if i get to keep more of my income, assuming a net benefit. This would depend on your spending habits i assume but that comes down to personal choice. Im just not seeing the reason for debating a point no one disagrees with. Am i missing something?

For me, I am just not seeing a large scale industrial policy wherein the tariffs can work as a tool to encourage the growth of good paying jobs here at home. Let's take something super mundane: drywall screws. A box of about 500 is going to cost you ~15 dollars or so, give or take depending on quality and brand. The profit margin per screw is stupidly small. No company that makes those screws is going to move stateside, even with tarrifs, because the baseline production cost at home is too high for such a low value-add product. 

Cars, of course, are very much a high value add and might be a good thing to have tariffs to discourage offshoring the production to some other nation, but, if it is still cheaper even with tariffs then the move will still happen. Tariffs, by themselves, won't be enough to convince companies to return to the states

By also going up to $675 all the american company is doing is forcing the entire market to consider if they really need a new washer and then making it unimportant to the consumer of where it came from. But if they would leave their price at $485, well now everyone is buying not only the cheaper option but the one MADE IN AMERICA. Now american production can grow, the company add jobs and now all that new money added to the market from those new employees goes on to raise sales and profits for other brands

When they have a choice, they will choose a lower priced high quality product over a higher priced lessor quality product most of the time. So what happens? American manufacturers start leaving America and moving over seas, taking with them all the jobs that were currently here. Sure, tariffs are going to hurt in the short term but maybe that is what it s going to take to start bringing jobs back to the US.

Tariffs, like all economic tools is incredibly complex. Certainly it has been demonstrated that the outcome is often unexpected. In the case of American tariffs, what is confusing is that they unusually benefited from it. Combine the dollar world order with the ""cheap"" imports. The American consuners were the winners. Work will not return. It will be automated, meaning a few people will get rich whike the rest will pay more and rven have less jobs available. Look luck America.

I think a lot of this , or at least I'm hoping, this is to shine a light on the fact that nearly everyone tarriffs our exports but wants to import for free and that shouldnt be the case. Im also hopeful this increases anerican labor. I understand there are downsides but this can be played right so lets be hopeful that the outcome will be better for us. Bottom line is something has to change and im atleast hopeful now that someone is trying a change

I think 11:45 is a huge key here. Tariffs reduce international competition, so if there's enough competition in domestic industry then they can work. That requires restrictions on large corporations while allowing smaller ones to flourish.

The issue is trump is pro-corporation, and we have several domestic monopolies + tariffs. Plus trump has no idea what America's accessible natural resources are - those are the industries we should be targeting with tariffs. We're about to get much shittier, much more expensive products while the government and domestic CEOs get tons of money through ""indirect taxes"".

India continues to be protectionist in key industries but I don’t know that local players have stepped up to compete, they just don’t have a need to. I don’t think the productivity increases from protectionism are guaranteed unless it’s a well thought out plan, and local companies don’t use them as an excuse to take their foot off the gas. It’s consumers that suffer in these cases. I’m thinking of high end electronics and computer parts,  EVs in India’s case…

You haven’t talked about outsourcing == brain drain. Anytime you outsource a job, the outsourcee gains the skill and experience, and the outsourceor gets rusty…. This multiplies over time… eventually, the outsourceor’s skills and tools are outdated, and the outsourcee’s skills and tools are at the bleeding edge of innovation. I’ve never heard this mentioned in economic theory, but I’ve seen it played out in the optics industry. Tariffs can be a tool to mitigate this brain drain. Tarrifs are an easy way to encourage local companies to not outsource. Especially for new and high tech individuals where a competitive advantage is beneficial.

Honestly, Mexico, Canada, the EU and whoever else should just deal with the tariffs, put on proportionate retaliatory ones and wait him out. He probably wouldn't keep them going four years if it meant sky-high inflation, but even if he did, the next president wouldn't. As painful as a recession is, I'm sure the concessions he's demanding are also awful and would last longer. In the meantime, like-minded countries should decouple and reduce reliance on the US.

By what basis can you say that the necessary tax surplus would not be created?  This also isn't being done to lower income tax, it is being done to ELEMINATE federal income taxation and that is a very big distinction.  Getting a 25-30% pay increase will offset a 10-15% increase in the price of SPECIFIC goods.  If you are dramatically impacted economically by that increase in goods prices even with increased pay then you are already in a terminal financial situation no matter what happens.  This also ignores the insane bloat and corruption of the federal budget.  Once that is reigned in the overall cost required to keep the federal government functioning will be dramatically reduced.  China is also an adversarial nation in rapid decline, who has basically declared war so decoupling from them economically is also an important strategy.

For me, the only real argument is national defense. Being cut off from something like semiconductors would be a disaster for the US so it would make sense in an industry like that. But blanket tariffs are just insane.

Another point, I heard Tim Cook explaining why Apple still produces in China, and it isn't because of cost but expertise and infrastructure. He claims the US has nowhere close to level of expertise than China has. This is something that takes years to cultivate. Idk, maybe you can make the argument it's better in 10 years but that's a big ""if""

Tariffs worked back in the 1800s, but supply chains are global right now. There are some things we simply cannot and never will be able to produce, mine, or grow at scale to satisfy even domestic demand (notably, much of our semiconductor business, which literally powers virtually every electronic product we own and use to live). I wouldn't be opposed to imposing tariffs on China - their state-sponsored companies can steal industry secrets, their goods are often priced to undercut competition, and they undermine US manufacturing as a result. However, there are certain things we simply cannot mine or produce at the scale of China, most importantly rare earth metals which are necessary for virtually every motorized or electric device we use. Even if we started a vast device recycling program, the price of actually extracting and refining those materials for reuse would likely be just as if not more expensive than just buying from china at higher prices.

Key point (specifically with regards to businesses passing the rising costs due to tariffs onto consumers): the power ALWAYS lies with the customers.
Businesses are faced with two options; raise the prices to pay tariffs, or move to the US. 
WE WANT THEM TO MOVE PRODUCTION TO THE US. NOT RAISE PRICES.
so how do we do it? DON'T BUY EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS. 
If you pay the higher prices you have nobody to blame but yourself for the higher costs. 
Don't blame the government, because tarrifs have the potential of being a FANTASTIC solution to fixing all the inflation that the democrats create through creating a greater divide between the poor and the wealthy. But it will never work if we keep giving these companies our money rather than forcing them to be better. 
We have the opportunity to help pay off all the debts, fix the money printing problem that the last administration plagued us with, which will in turn lower inflation. 
But we have to be vigilant.
If you don't buy from foreign companies that raise their prices, they will be forced to comply and help the economy, if you DO buy from them, you are giving into these greedy companies and you are the sole reason for your own higher cost of living. NOT the tariffs.
Tarrifs are great, it is us, the people, that are contributing to rising costs.
You don't need to our financial education to see that, just think about it simply. If you were a business and were faced with tariffs to import to the US, would you raise the prices so you didn't have to lose profit, or would you move your factories to the US? The answer is simple. Unless you are forced to do so, you're going to keep manufacturing over seas and save your bottom line. So its up to us to force them to move to USA to continue making profits. DON'T BUY PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES (until they eventually give in and move to US to remain competitive).
It's not an anti-foreginers thing, it's a pro-economy thing. If you want to be able to afford food, then force the supply chain to drop prices by only buying American. They will set up shop in USA, and create job opportunities and it will be a much better thing for the world then them trying to be as cheap as possible and passing those costs down to you thus draining the economy.

Perhaps im ignorant but its very clear why he put such strong tarrifs on Canada and Mexico. Its because they are the main foreign suppliers of crude oil for the U.S.A. Trump has always been about targeting energy back to the U.S. this will force America to reinvigorate the production of energy (oil) which is the basis for manufacturing. 

The energy price to operate far succeeds the wage difference. If manufacturing companies in the U.S save on energy then they will actually be able to afford the wages needed to pay the workers....at least this is what is hoped.

This isnt a battle about avacados, onions, and candian  alcholol this is about jumpstarting oil production in the USA.

Hope you guys don't need to pay for decades long policy to ""protect the infant industry"" like we do, spending more money for worse products and bootlegs of foreign goods.

Guys, u dont understand basic. Good will be cost 25% more, but this 25% of price goes to government budget! This is main reason.  Its working as tax for all non domestic goods, parts, and materials.

WTH difference does it make WHERE you pay the tax?   The point is that we will be paying more taxes, a LOT more, called instead, tariffs.  The selling country doesn't pay the tariffs, WE DO, as importers and consumers.  I had a couple  of expensive items I was going to buy that are now under tariffs.   Guess what, I won't be buying them, there, or here, until these farking tariffs disappear.

The graph you had about tariffs throughout the last 200 years shows an instant huge dip after each spike. This means it did work, for a very short time, resulting in prices of things just sky rocketing. Tariffs DO NOT WORK! it's a selfish way. It creates a constant rise in prices...

Were you being serious when you said that the market for American pickup trucks is not as competitive or innovative as it should be?  I have to assume that this perspective is because you are on the outside looking in, with your own biases looking at it through a lens colored by your own domestic market.  

Our domestic pickup truck market is fiercely competitive and when left alone it innovates to give our consumers what they want.  It is usually government intervention that causes it to ""innovate"" in ways that the market does not want, such as the recent regulatory push for EV pickups.

China sells lets say Tshirt to America for 10 dollars. 
America buys it for 10 dollars, sells it for 15 dollars 
America imposes 25% tax.
Now Tshirt costs 12.5 dollars to get from China
America buys it for 12.5 dollars and sells it for 17.5
China doesnt lose money at this point, its American consumers that losing the money.

It's hard to find a single case in history where tariffs worked. It was tried many times in USA by other presidents, but always let to economic downfall. So either people can believe, that one person somehow will make things work which never worked  before, or that his goal is different. It can't be proven, but during crisis rich people get richer, average and poor become more poor. While Trump and his friends as true businessman profit, poor people cheer for him, because he ""made america look strong"".

In a bottle, yes tariffs are bad for consumers. But please don't forget the opposite of tariffs: subsidies. I think the idea of today's tariffs, is to counteract the subsidies policy of China. Remember, companies in China are partially owned by the state. This onto itself is unfair competition. If you include the fact that a lot of companies are also getting subsidies from the state(for example the car industry in China gets advantageous energy prices, in comparison with other industries in China), you can see why tariffs could be a good idea to level the play field, to be able to compete. So yeah, in a 100% fair economy, tariffs are a bad thing. But we are not living in a fair world economy, are we?

The short-term issues with the tariffs are apparent; but the overarching problem here is that the US economy consistently operates at a massive deficit. Our prosperity is fake.

The only reason the us economy hasn't collapsed yet is because the USD is the world reserve currency (which is presently the case for a whole other list of reasons); effectively meaning the negative impacts of US economic policy are being distributed across most of the worlds population, rather than the US exclusively.

You might be able to argue that this status quo is preferable; but the reality is that the rest of the world will only tolerate so much more of this until they decide to leverage something else, like the Chinese Yuan, as the de facto reserve currency; at which point, it's game over.

The reality is that Americans are too comfortable and do not produce anywhere near enough value to afford their lifestyles; and Trump's tariffs appear to be the softest way to incentivize americans to take on risk and produce value; even if they do have a suite of temporal negative effects

The best way to bring more jobs to the USA is to bring more factories to US, and tariffs is no longer the right way for to do that. 

The best way is cut of the taxes to the companies, many companies will transfer their production to the USA, the right is it be zero taxes to the companies, it will force a good competition between countries to attract the companies, if cut the taxes to the companies it means the products will be cheaper, and the people will get a good benefit from that competition. 

This is basic, however, government just ignore that fact. 

Another thing is, cut of the federal income tax or it should be a little just to self defense only, as Israel does, the cost to be the cops on the world is to high for us US citizen, and today no-one wants to be those sponsors anymore.

I didn't vote for him, but the idea of tariffs didn't turn me off aside from the obvious hypocrisy of basing a campaign on complaining about higher prices while also championing an economic strategy that would further raise prices. I mean, tariffs, done right, could actually help the country in the long run.

However, the way he has gone about it has all the trappings of the exact wrong way to approach it. The problems aren't Mexico and Canada, they are China, the other Asian tigers, and the EU. If anything, Canada and Mexico are in a similar position to us. We could be partnering with them to achieve our goals, but instead we deeply antagonize them for so little gain.

The most important parts of the argument is missed:
1) Who does the ""counting""? We are also told that the US has the worst neonatal care in the western world. However, if one looks to see HOW baby deaths are counted, then you will see the US has the HIGHEST care. France. for instance, doesn't count any baby that is thought to have no chance of survival while the US counts EVERY baby regardless. The Friedman side is basically hoisted by their own petard. Tariffs and their effects are too complex to actually know exactly what the effects are. They are just estimations.
2) The poker problem. If you do not think tariffs have their place, then you must think you can play poker against a billionaire when you are just a normal person without betting limits. The US can't not compete against a world that has as much slavery as it does. And make no mistake about it. China uses slave labor.

I could go on, but why? If economic ideas would work, then this country wouldn't have been hollowed out by NAFTA.

The US has been on a slow march towards deglobalization for a long time. Or perhaps more clearly stated, the US has been pushing towards self-sufficient production, and keeping as much as possible to be an exporter. Food, energy, military, and tech has been the focus since the 90s. And now the focus is moving towards manufacturing.
And this isn't something new. It started with the new nafta treaties in 2018, trying to move manufacturing ""close to home"" even if ""at home"" didn't seem practical... But manufacturing didn't move much, as it was still cheaper to manufacture in Asia, and import to the US directly. It wasn't until the first set of terrifs and the pandemic's interruption of supply chains that traction started happening. And then Biden doubled down on many of the same policies, and actually enforced the policies put forward by trump that ended up being easy to skirt around. And now trump seems to be tripping down on it all.

The things to watch that is taking people by surprise are
1) it is no longer just cheap Asian imports being targeted. The scope has broadened to practically all imported goods, even from allies and partner countries with long standing beneficial relationships. And nobody really saw that coming.
2) that the focus is no longer around bringing manufacturing purely to north America to keep prices low importing from Canada and Mexico which seemed to be the plan with Trump 1.0 and Biden. Now the rhetoric is that Canada and Mexico should seek statehood if they want nafta-like treatment... Which would make Republicans never re-electable ever again, which is why I think it is rhetorical and not an honest suggestion.

The thing is... This is already the direction things were moving. Just much more aggressively than anyone's wildest expectations. It takes time to build a manufacturing base, and it was actively being worked on, so the rush and change of the goal posts seem a little bit crazy.
I think the other effect is just how much this will cause disruptions to manufacturing and supply side inflation in the short run. As well as manufacturer side inflation building out the infrastructure and hiring needed to make this practical. Until the transition completes, we will likely see 5-10% inflation be normal before things settle down... And that could be a decade or two, which would be rough.
I suspect that the thinking is that we have the lead on AI and robotics, which will allow a sort of jobless manufacturing revolution. If that proves out, then inflation effects could be greatly minimized by the deflationary effects of automation... But as someone to follows those fields quite a bit, I don't think we are there yet at a practical level. Great strides have been made, and it is coming in the next decade... But pushing this hard this fast is taking too much AI PR hype at face value and not understanding how immature the tech is right now. It will get there... But still 3-5 years before any real reliable deployment is ready with expected costs and procedures that can last more than a couple years before being redone. And doing double-work at that scale is expensive and inflationary, not cost savings and deflationary like tech often is.

Next 4 years are going to be weird... I don't know. The world lost its mind, and we are all turning into Russia now. And I'm pretty sure that Russia is the first to say that they don't want to be Russia, so I'm not sure what the game plan and motive is.

At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for Trump's insane ""strategy"" to even have a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products Americans buy today (or the components that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years; a lot of private and government investment; and lower cost labor (more legal immigration) to reverse the trend that drove the production of consumer products to China and Mexico in the late 90s and early 00s.

Very disappointed that this video is simply a more detailed version of a first-order analysis on tariffs.  You can't talk about tariffs in an economic vacuum without considering currency devaluations when tariffs are imposed, the level of government subsidies foreign goods may receive, and the usage of tariffs as a negotiating tactic to achieve geopolitical goals (i.e., with Mexico and Canada).  Any analysis that doesn't include political impacts as relates to foreign policy is misleading to viewers.

When another politician puts what is basically a tax on foreign companies, we all totally understand how to impacts prices, since those corporations just pass along the added cost of the tariff (tax).

""Where tariffs will be placed on things that never were and never can be made in the domestic economy.""
What a back asswards concept.   The point of tariffs is to encourage domestic manufacturing, not make more expensive things that never were and never can be made in the domestic economy. That's just ridiculous.  Tariff laws must include a clause that loophole avoidance (such as the flat pack example in the video) should be penalized appropriately.

I think many people are making the mistake of taking Trump/Musk at face value. It's definitely a mistake to think either of them is stupid and doesn't know how damaging things like blanket tariffs can be. It's Trump's version of ""gunboat diplomacy,"" where he gets what he really wants because everyone knows he is prepared to take action that everyone else would think insane. Getting Panama to leave the Chinese Belt and Road scheme being a good example.

The problem is there isn’t current movement back to the US besides the fear of the tariffs.
There is no reason to move to the US where the regulation on your business is so much higher.
China has us beat at grunt labor. I don’t think we can beat their sweatshop wages.
The idea was americans would get smarter and we would just do all the innovating and let the other countries do the work; however, a lot of dumb people here still need careers and so we need a certain amount of industry.
We only need a bit more and i believe our problems could be solved by by cutting regulations not by blanket tariffs.
I believe we actually don’t want to be the industrial powerhouse when we are and could remain the innovation powerhouse.
There are many other problems trump should focus on before this.

Trump has tariffed  everything, low value stuff as well as high value items that just might have been brought back

Man, I agree with Trump and Trumpers.  It is about time we showed the world what we can do.   No components,  none should be from a non-domestic source.  Every component, every single screw, every chip, everything, should be from the US.   Not only that, but all labor should be from the US - none of this near-shore, off-shore nonsense.  I mean everything, including all the raw materials, the silicon, the iron, the plastics, mined, refined by US companies.   The bulldozer used to get the raw materials?  Only use 100% US machinery.  Only US mines and domestic sources.  If the materials, machinery, or skills don't exist?  Then screw it, we will do without.  The Amish live just fine and so will we.

Considering only national security and business, disregarding ethical concerns.

I understand that this video is not entirely about this but is it at all possible that if trump were to put tarrifs on all imported goods and do away with income tax entirely that the two could cancel each other out? The individual products you purchase would cost more but you would be saving a lot of money by not having to pay income tax. As for a business owners perspective, I actually own a small construction company and pay around 30% on income tax, If I have to pay 25% more on materials but not pay income taxes I'm still up 5% on my net profit. I completely understand that a nations economy is a fickle thing and every change in policy can have unexpected results, but I believe that if it were done carefully, it could be done. I realize that there are and always will be companies that will use any chance they get to, lets be honest price gouge, but my customers can only afford to pay me so much for my services. So at least for myself in the above scenario I would lower my labor rate and pass the increased cost of goods onto the customer saving us both a little money and being able to outbid my more greedy compition on contracts. As for my now untaxed pay check, the amount would be a little higher, but all products would cost more, however I would essentially be ""paying taxes"" on only the products and services I actually use, making it easier to save money in the long run right?

Seeing how the peso is down against the USD by 20% year over year and the Canadian dollar is down about 10%, tariffs are a logical step to balance the devaluation of their currencies. Fast forward a day or two, and Mexico and Columbia agreed to meet the terms to avoid tariffs anyway.

I'm sorry but was this a joke? Bra are you really comparing today tariffs to the 1800s? Lewis and Clark just happened, the Mexican American war didn't happen until the tail end ️ just admit Trump isn't making zero sense. He can't come up with trillions in tariffs vs the income tax, stop it.

Trump needs to raise tax's on American workers to offset the renewing of the Corporate tax cut. So he cant raise income tax's so this is the 3 card trick. He is a con man always has been. This will cost American households about $2600 per year.

Its just possible the blanket ban shoes trump which tariffs to drop later. What price increases vs domestic manufacting at home hits his voters the most. What gets reported on fox news and can producers and retailers just say its tariffs without tariffs ever having that impact on them like the dryers.
In an ideal plan, you'd tariff high value imports like cars in mexico and Canada or expensive electronics (robots, precision engineering, dumped goods looking for any market sales even at a loss). He'd tariff chips but he need Taiwan and the chip act needs time and the intel saga to work out. 
The good news is that all those markets taiffed will look to export away from the US

Written by someone who clearly only thinks short term and is unable to fully comprehend the entirety of the tarrif system.
I would like anyone who thinks a tarrif based system cannot work to do something.  Go look at your last pay stub.  Look at exactly how much you lose to taxes and figure out exactly how much you would gain in a year if you didn't have to pay it.  Then add on your fees, if any, to file those taxes.
Now, with this number in mind, would you have more or less money per year if the prices of every day goods rose by 10%, which would be more than expected?
For most Americans, that is going to be a massive increase in savings, if they manage it properly.  After a few years, the market will adjust, raising employment costs or lowering everything from employment costs and prices.  In the end, when you see a job advertising XX per year, that is actually what it pays instead of half that.  People will be more capable of living within their means instead of relying on credit.
Tarrifs simplify so much if it were to replace income tax.  The world is complicated enough and moving so fast that most cannot keep up, even if they won't admit it.  Tarrifs will help overall.  The only people it would actually hurt are the super wealthy, which doesn't actually hurt them, or those who are unwilling to manage money properly, which they do to themselves.

Lets just say it.  Tariffs are a priori destructive.  No cases exist where they are economically beneficial because they eliminate competition and force consumers to buy goods they didnt want to voluntarily buy in the first place.  Tariffs raise prices and lower quality simultaneously while also picking individual winner and loser goods in the market.  Its honestly hard to think of a tax method that is more destructive and distorts the market forces more unfairly than tariffs.

Think the point is that the American Economy is strong enough to handle price increases right now if it means that geo-political missions are accomplished. China, Mexico and Canada can only hold on for so long without American's buying their exports. At some point they'll have to cave and give in to what the Americans want. Which I believe is for those countries to do a better job of policing their borders and drug traffickers. In my opinion, it's worth it.

Key takeaways:
1. Tariffs are paid by the importer and passed on to the consumer, but Trump has convinced MAGA that Mexico and China will pay for the tariffs.
2. Even if inflation worsens, MAGA will blame Democrats instead of looking into the mirror.
3. Expect dramatic increases in export from countries like Vietnam due to Chinese exports flowing through there.
4. Tariffs won't create factories in America out of thin air, the most likely outcome is importing everything from the next cheapest country. 
5. Even with tariffs in place, most goods made in Mexico and China will still be way cheaper than those made in the U.S

Too bad the Vlogger had to get into an anti-Trump screed. Tariffs never caused a single price increase, the increase of appliance prices were complex and varied. And it was never explained how tariffs are actually levied, which is on a first purchase price... he doesn't go into the supply chain, full of middle men, where the real price increases happen. This guy usually does a pretty good job, too bad he merely aggregated the establishment view and really didn't drill down into the mechanism of tariffs.

If you do the math, 1800 jobs at 815k per job, that's 1.467 billion. Pretty darn close to the 1.5 billion. Also you have to account for the dryers cost being raised as well as the taxed washing machine. Which is a relatively unique example of price increases, that inflates that 1.5 billion. Also in your example of steel, why didn't the domestic industries like auto, just buy domestic made steel? At 9:12  shouldn't that mean more domestic steel companies start popping up to meet the demand? I'm not quite convinced by this evidence you presented.

I'm in support of tariffs worldwide because we need to grow more localized industry (both for the purpose of wealth equality and climate reasons) but ironically they simply wont work in any positive manner unless you were to implement so called 'socialist' policies like taxing the 1% more (which solved the great depression) and dismantling the financial sector along with the myth of infinite growth. 

Otherwise countries like america are simply hastening their current path to mimic china more closely with a few ultra wealthy families paying slave wages to workers in unsafe conditions and hoarding the generated wealth to themselves (which is already their current situation, just not as extreme yet). Funnily enough Trump even wants to reintroduce children to factory work, just like china.

9,"Small business owner here: Tariffs on the things I buy (my cookbooks, and a few other things) are printed in China through a Chicago based company.

When I looked locally for printing services, the price was 3x. If the price had been 1.5x I would have considered it, but 3x is too much. Most people won't pay $50 for a cook book and I don't want to charge that.

I just got a notice from the company we work with that I'm being charged another 10% on my next shipment as a ""just in case"". I don't have a choice here, I just have to eat the cost.

21,"The biggest issue that wasn't addressed is that companies need to believe that the tariffs will be stable long term.

22,Once prices go up manufacturers and corporations selling the goods rarely lower them.

24,"Avocado trees grown from seed can take anywhere from 5 to 15 years—or even longer—to bear fruit, while grafted trees typically produce fruit within 2 to 3 years. However, some trees may never produce fruit at all. So, if you’re planning to grow your own, good luck with that.  

Now, let’s talk about something even more essential—coffee. The U.S. consumes a staggering 54 billion tons of coffee per year but produces only 11.2 billion tons, leaving a massive gap that must be filled through imports. The U.S. sources coffee from countries like Canada, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and Indonesia. I’m all for strengthening American industries, but we’re stepping into an economic battle without the necessary resources. In the short term, this is going to hurt—a lot. Hopefully, your job isn’t on the chopping block when the dust settles.  

Will this strategy pay off in the long run? That’s a tough call. Look at North Korea—we forced them into self-reliance, but at what cost? Russia tried to isolate itself from the global economy, yet after three years, they still haven’t managed to take over a much smaller neighboring country. And then there’s the UK—ask them how Brexit is going. The results of economic isolation aren’t exactly promising. Maybe this will work out, but we’re taking a huge gamble.  

Launching an economic war without the proper preparation—without the ""armor and weapons,"" so to speak—was reckless. There had to be a smarter way to approach this.  

The U.S. relies heavily on imports for essential goods, including fruits and vegetables. Mexico, for example, supplies a significant portion of our tomatoes, berries, and avocados. It’s easy to say, “We’ll just grow it ourselves,” but reality isn’t that simple. Growing food at scale requires the right climate, soil conditions, labor force, and infrastructure. Certain crops, like coffee and avocados, thrive in specific environments that the U.S. simply doesn’t have in abundance. Even if we could expand domestic production, the costs would be much higher, and the supply wouldn’t be able to meet demand overnight.  

It’s not just about whether we  grow it—it’s about whether we can do so efficiently, affordably, and at the scale needed to sustain the economy."
25,"Tariffs only work when the domestic labor is cheap and there is a need to protect developing domestic manufacturer.  That is how South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan developed their industry.  But, the U.S. labor is expensive and there is no need to protect already competitive American manufacturers.  The tariff will worsen the inflation and hurt the American people."
26,"If Trump is advocating for economic chaos, it could be part of a strategy in which market crashes are perceived as chances for the ultra-rich to acquire assets at reduced prices. Annually, those with substantial capital tend to benefit disproportionately during periods of volatility"
27,"Getting an ad for Economics Explained before an Economics Explained video was wild lol

Edit: make that the midroll ad too"
28,There's also this naive belief that large scale manufacturing in the U.S will create a bunch of new jobs. The reality is when building new facilities in the U.S the cost of labor makes mass automation far more attractive and the desire to make energy prices cheaper only motivates this even more.
29,We get 1.8 million tons of tomatoes from Mexico. We don’t have the infrastructure or labor to fill that gap our selves. So it’s not driving production anywhere. Just prices up. Substitute tomatoes for coffee or any number of things.
30,"8:46 Plates, sheets, strips, beams, bars, rods, pipes, billets, blooms and slabs

WE NEED A REMIX OF THIS!"
31,"This depends what the goal is. Tariffs do not work if the goal is to grow the economy and to make people richer. If the goal is national security with local supply chains, then they can work for that purpose."
32,"The claim about the 1890s cuts against the grain of research on those tariffs.  They benefited a few industries that were already doing well, but were incredibly harmful to consumers."
33,"Price increases, brought to you by the people who said prices were too high."
34,it’s like watching a slow-motion car crash where half the passengers are cheering it on because they think the wreckage will somehow only hit other people
35,"Great video! As an economics professor here in Brazil, I'm very familiarized with those consequences of tariffs. It's hard to impose a developmental program on tariffs these days, Brazil has many examples where it didn't work AND nowadays, we are suffering from one of those old days protections: coffee inflation, we are used to coffee surplus but last year we have a dramatic reduction in coffee production to internal market and import it is expensive because tariffs. Brazilians can't dispense coffee from our routine consumption (it is very inelastic), even breakfast here is called: ""café da manhã"" (""coffee of the morning"" in a literal translation)."
36,"I absolutely the shift in rhetoric from his voters. Going from ""everything's expensive, we want lower grocery bills"" to ""we'll happily pay way more for the stuff we buy for the off chance that our grandkids can work in a factory in the future where they'll still be unable to afford those now American-made goods.""

The Chinese are loving this."
37,Its not an economic tool when you put 25% on all import from one country.
38,"let me introduce you to the iphone 18
cost:$5000
made in USA by a minimum wage worker who was forced to work in a sweat shop for 14hours a day"
39,"10:54 ahh, the chicken tax - the reason why we're stuck with shitty trucks while the rest of the world can enjoy the immortal Hilux."
40,"Remember that the subsidies to 'farmers' that cost as much as the tariffs were bringing in went overwhelmingly to big agribusiness -- not to family farms.  It effectively taxed all Americans, resulting in higher consumer prices, while paying out billions to the richest Americans.  This was the plan all along -- tax all Americans and funnel that money to the richest Americans."
41,He slapped blanket tariffs (excluding oil) of 25% on two countries we import a ton of basic necessities from. 2024 will be a terrible year for consumers.
42,no. there are some cases where it can be good but like... a raw 25% increase across the board? that just incentivizes bad business
43,"Looks like we got the answer to this one pretty quickly. Yes, tariffs apparently work as a political bargaining chip to bring a foreign country to the table. I would say they work effectively, given that it took all of one day for Canada and Mexico to come to the table and agree to Trump's initial terms in order to get a temporary stay on the tariffs."
44,Tariffs will make life more expensive for americans
45,"One thing that never seems to be mentioned: soft power. All these tariffs, deportations, hissy fit withdrawal from international institutions and economic sabre rattling just introduces uncertainty, confusion and international enmity towards the U.S"
46,"when a bunch of countries focus another and put tariff on it? yes, it works

when your country starts aiming at every other country and apply tariff to them... isn't then YOUR country the one being aimed by the others?"
47,Thanks for the ad in the middle.
48,Tariff is an economic tool that is used to protect a sector which is important to national security of the country. Trump is betting that Canada and Mexico will capitulate under pressure from American tariff. Problem is that tariff will impact American consumers and industry as well. If Canada and Mexico resolve is strong and want to stand against America then Trump will taste a bitter defeat as his campaign promise was reduction of inflation.
49,"Classical economists figured this out since Ricardo. Tariffs only hurt consumers. Ricardo, Keynes, Friedman, and basically all other economists agree. This isn't a debate among economists."
50,"Being an American that actually understands tariffs and some impacts on prices we pay and back and forth cost with foreign tariffs, I still learned so much from your presentation. Especially why tariffs appeared to work more than a century ago and even in the 60's but possibly questionable now and the way in which they are being implemented. Unfortunately, we have elected a president with hammer. God bless all the screws that suffer!"
51,"This is exactly what I have been saying, and I've never taken an Econ class in my life. How a government could get it so wrong is just astounding. 

This leads me to the conclusion of an ulterior motive. What exactly that is though is speculation. However some options are politics/controlling culture, generating wealth for certain people, greater control of the masses through buying power,  militaristic expansion."
52,The question to ask is: who are these tariffs intended to benefit? The answer is not the american public
53,"There is a pattern to isolationist countries in contemporary times: they get poorer, sometimes much poorer.  The age of mercantilism is long gone: we don't have the stomach or means to  take and control enormous blocks of territory to make it work."
54,"As a South American. NOOOOO, THEY DONT WORK.
Every south american country followed the ""Industrialization by Substitution of Imports (ISI)"" system between the 50's and the 60's (basically puting tarifs on a lot of imported goods, with the objetive of growing our local industries)
To finish my story: Every country got poorer, THE END"
55,Amazing and to the point explanation!
56,My company recently built a factory in Mexico. Consequently all US manufacturing was shut down. During a town hall meeting someone asked the CEO if Biden's chips acts will reindustrialize America and he said until the govt can bridge the labor gap it will never be economical to manufacture in the US when it costs 6x less in other countries.
57,"I've seen what this type of blanket tariffs do to the market, consumers will be worse off. This protection causes the locals to be complacent and we ended with expensive quality import or marginally negligibly cheaper but worse local products."
58,"This went right over the most important thing. After WWI, in 1929, the Smoot-Hawley tariff act, preciptated the great depression, which lasted up to the rearmament for WWII."
59,Short answer: Yes
60,"Yeah man, who can forget that Trump's tariffs worked so well last time, he had to bail out farmers.
Edit: Seems like people don't know the difference between a subsidy and a bailout."
61,Also worth noting that the chips act and tariffs placed on China last time around meant that they had to be more innovative and resourceful which lead to Deepseek and $1 trillion getting ripped off the stock market.
62,"The problem is the economic effect is not the goal, the threats are geopolitical leverage meant to force concessions."
63,"A topic not covered, but extremely important is that the impact (the pain) on consumers is inversely proportional to their wealth. Meaning, the poorer will become poorer, and the increased price on the usual goods won't impact that much the rich => more inequality, more civil unrest, and just more overall unhappiness. It's yet another ""tax on the poor"" ..."
64,"Tariffs are an import tax paid by the importer when goods arrive at the port. Blanket tariffs do nothing but raise prices and, in turn, increase inflation. This will do the exact opposite of lowering prices for us as consumers."
65,"As an American expat living in Brazil, which has a lot of protectionist policies and tariffs, I can say as a consumer that I am left with poor quality yet expensive products from national brands for electronics.  Somehow Samsung and LG have an exception to be here in some categories, so we can get good TVs and washing machines, but small kitchen electronics and even things like fans are expensive and made of cheap plastic.  One thing I noticed when I first moved here was that protein powder was expensive.  It turns out protein powder was subject to a luxury tax lumped with things like jet skis to protect the local market.  A few years ago I think they were going to get rid of the tariff on protein powder and the local dairy industry protested because whey is a byproduct that provides a nice income stream and they wanted to keep the protections.  Also, the protein market is dominated by whey-- it is very hard to get soy or other types of protein powder, again because whey is a byproduct of a large dairy industry.   I think tariffs only work if it is tapered over a set period of time to give the local industry time to catch up.  If they are in place indefinitely, companies don't innovate and get efficient (and are incentivized to be greedy and keep prices high), and consumers get inferior products that are expensive."
66,"Imagine my shock over a complex subject with much nuance is boiled down to one-sentence insults on social media. 

I bet nobody saw that coming."
67,As it turns out the primary effect of a tariff is leverage.
68,"I could go back to expensive goods if they lasted. Unfortunately, goods such as furniture, and so many household appliances, don't hold up over time."
69,No politics. Just economics. All it takes is an Aussie to give you real unbiased solid information. I loved my semester abroad studying business there!
70,Kudos on navigating a neutral tone for this topic by optimistically framing the fact that tariffs might benefit decades down the road if done strategically and effectively.  That being said...the pros/cons side of things for this move is heavy on the cons side.
71,What a fantastic video. Excellent points using historical examples of how tariffs worked for and against. All in an easily digestible format. Thank you for making this!
72,"Tariffs only make sense to protect strategic industries like food or defense production. For everything else, they're nonesense."
73,"Here's a list of U.S. products that Canada has placed tariffs on, based on the information available:

Dairy Products:
Milk: 270%
Cheese: 245%
Butter: 298%
Yogurt: Included but percentage not specified
Sausages: 69.9%
Poultry:
Chicken: 238%"
74,Another thing to consider is that now manufacturing in first world economies is much more automated than it was when manufacturing left the US so even if tariffs brought back all of the production that has been sent offshore it will only benefit a relatively small portion of the population.
75,Excellent video! Very balanced and level headed approach to the subject.  I'm an immediate fan of this channel.
76,This was an informative and fair video! I live in Canada so it will be interesting to see how things go. I'm predicting poorly for all involved.
77,"Well, first things first. Putting tariffs on your  political and economical allies is just dumb.

The tariffs on computer chips from Taiwan (TSMC) without having a comparable chip manufacturing here in the states is just suicide.

Intel sucks. They sucked so much in their own fabs, they started to outsource to TSMC. And TSMC has plants being built in AZ, but they won't even be staffed until mid 2025 and won't start to produce until 2026. And even then, the fab is a fraction of what exists in Taiwan.

It's like quitting a job with no unemployment and no job lined up. It's just stupid. These tariffs are dumb but man, if you're gonna do it, you could at least wait to do it until we have it stateside."
78,I got an ad for your documentary on this video haha
79,Great video! Very educative and full of nuances
80,"O thank you, ive been waiting for this one, was searching your channel for it yesterday actually. Youre on of the only economists I trust. None of these politisized, big media companies."
81,"if someone in the admin would have a little education on the past history of such things, as the hawley-smoot act, they wouldn't have to  be going thru this..."
82,The tariffs placed on Mexico and Canada are foolish at best.
83,This is the kind of information the public needs. Objective education by educators with no political bias or skin in the game
84,"If there's the commensurate incentive to redevelop local industry to replace prohibitively expensive imports? Yes.

If it's still too hard to build local sourcing, no."
85,"Write your congressman to rescind the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The founding fathers kept the power to tax with congress for a good reason, they shouldn't have given it away."
86,"That point about income tax not existing until 1910 has A LOT MORE to do with the fact that US gov did not provide most services we associate it with today, they did a lot less so they needed a lot less hence no need for income tax. Nowadays tariffs could never be enough to provide everything you are used to, from public weather forecast, skilled firefighting and police forces, and the large subsidies on everything from corn, beef, apples to automotive industry. They sure did not have public airports and metro (first NYC metro actually opened in 1904 but it was private at the time) and they sure did not bail out their banks and carmakers time and time again. THAT is the real reson."
87,So far every tariff has lasted an average of 9 minutes before the imposed country caves so... I'm gonna go with yes.
88,"If tariffs cause potential rivals to create their own versions of industries they relied on you for that removes another barrier to conflict, increasing risks of conflict."
89,"For a long time, the U.S. got most of its money from tariffs, but as the country grew and needed more cash for things like infrastructure and social programs, tariffs weren’t cutting it anymore. By 1913, with the 16th Amendment, they introduced income tax, which made raising money way simpler and fairer—especially since it could target higher earners more. This move basically ended America’s heavy reliance on tariffs and opened up the door to a bigger government role in the economy. Going back to tariffs ONLY suits the richer people and would require a massive cut in government spending. Tariffs swapped in against lower progressive income tax are a flat tax rate which is particularly rough on the lower 80% of earners suiting only at best the top 20% and more likely the top 5% of earners."
90,All good points. Tax the rich. Tax companies. Regulate prices. Regulate profit growth. Enable ownership by the worker. Stop the growing inequality.
91,"If most Americans recognized that a tariff is a tax, I wonder if they would still be on board for it. ""My taxes are too high, they should be lower! Except when I buy groceries, appliances, gas and cars, then they should be higher!!!"""
92,what happened to being tough on China? You taxing China only 10% and our Mexican/Canadian friends 25%? How this make any sense
93,What was the root cause of all the tarrifs you mentioned?  Looks like lobbyists were holding down industry in areas we see for profits in areas we don't see.
94,Many people here have a lot of complaints about Tariffs before we even see what effects they have. Since many other countries use Tariffs we cannot complain that they extreme or somehow unfair. It is also glaringly clear that no one else has any plan of a better way to either repatriate industry or to ensure that companies that sell products in the US to follow US labor and environmental laws. I don't know if Tariffs will work but I see nothing from anyone else here. Saying it can't be done is defeatist and unhelpful. Come up with an alternative plan.
95,"It's just increased taxes ""Trump sales Tax"" was a good slogan"
96,"From the future here, they worked"
97,Short answer is ''No'' and the long answer is still ''No''.
98,"""Superbe vidéo ! Votre contenu est toujours aussi pertinent et bien expliqué. C'est un plaisir d'apprendre avec vous ! Continuez comme ça, vous apportez une vraie valeur à la communauté. "
99,Can we get the Economics of Economic Explained explained!?
100,"very timely video, but it's gonna be hard to follow stories with the frequency they are currently happening"
101,What about imposing tariffs that don't start for years to come in order to encourage long term divestment?
102,People need to understand the difference between short term impact and long term benefit.
103,"So far every country caved in days at most. Works great, used for negotiations."
104,From what I've heard the US tarriffs were in direct response to drug trafficking and Illegal migration from Canada and Mexico. It doesn't make sense to me that a sudden blanket tarriff on these countries would solve these seemingly unrelated issues...
105,Tariffs would only work if we are putting them on goods/services where we have a comparetive advantage in making
106,"There’s no need to overcomplicate things. The simplest explanation is that the cost of maintaining a global empire has begun to outweigh its benefits for the U.S., prompting it to retract its sphere of influence. To preserve as much of its original interests as possible during this retraction, it has resorted to imposing tariffs and maintaining the dollar’s dominance. In the foreseeable future, however, the era of dollar hegemony will inevitably end, and the U.S. will transition into a continental empire in the Americas."
107,It’s going to look expensive for everything…
108,And those American auto manufacturers are made in both Canada and America. And require back and forth between the countries multiple times. So the upcoming 25% Tarriffs are going to be charged multiple times. So the auto industry is going to die in both countries.
109,Mercedes doesn't have a plant in South Carolina. BMW has one there. The Mercedes plant is in Alabama.
110,"This is a much simpler way of looking at it:
Tariff → Higher Costs for Importers (Local companies buying international goods)
Enough Tariffs → Domestic Manufacturing Becomes More Competitive (Reduces imported goods)
Local Manufacturing Expansion → More Jobs & Higher Wages (Potentially)
Higher Wages → More Spending Power
More Money in the Economy → Higher Prices Become Manageable

Additionally, Tariffs hurt importing companies that are taking advantage of a much richer country and essentially draining their wealth.
As long as you are invested in the American economy or working in it, tariffs will not hurt you in the slightest."
111,They just did. Mexico just agreed to put 10000 soilders along the US border. The Tariff with Mexico is suspended.
112,Canada and Mexico folded..
113,Definitely worked as a negotiation tool
114,What a well thoughtout and well wxplained video. Thank you so much for your work. You won yourself a subscriber!
115,"You can't ""encourage entrepreneurs"" to grow certain food products in a part of the world where the plants are unable to grow. Unless we are going to turn Hawaii back into a series of plantations -- which was horribly unjust to the indigenous people already there -- or do the same to island territories that are part of the USA, we cannot grow coffee beans, cocoa beans, pineapple, etc. domestically . Yes, there are some areas in California and the south where we can grow avocados and citrus fruits, and what not -- but they are already pretty much spoken for. 

And until American companies are willing to pay American wages for manufacturing again, those jobs aren't coming back either, tariffs or not"
116,Ask Hoover. His similar tarif war lead to the great depression….but on the other hand great fortunes are built during economic turmoil…so it did work for the super rich.
117,"The rising rates can be attributed to increasing imports and decreasing exports, largely due to the Trump-era tariffs, which triggered retaliatory measures. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in the banking crisis, given its policies of quantitative tightening and higher interest rates. If these conditions persist, something will eventually give. With this in mind, is it really a good time to have savings invested in stocks?"
118,Once the prices are raised corporations can blame it on tariffs but once the tariffs are gone people are already used to paying the increased price so it never goes down
119,Why is everyone acting surprised that the guy they voted for is doing exactly what he said he would do 
120,Grabs popcorn and heads to the comments section
121,"I don't know about you, but I would much rather have the federal government funded by tariffs than income taxes. If you can buy American, you pay no federal taxes."
122,Good and mostly objective analysis. Thanks
123,"Considering Mexico has sent 10,000 troops to the U.S./Mexico border to help prevent flow of drugs (fentanyl) from crossing the border, I’d say we cannot simply rule tariffs out as a negotiating mechanism."
124,"You miss one important thing, which the main purpose of tariffs... its political.

Whether to just gain nationalist popularity like trump is doing.

Or on the other hand punish other states, just like trump is doing also ..

US may have lost money from tarrifing steel .. but the main purpose was getting leverage over others and delaying certains states development .. which is priceless, and the us is willing to pay the price for."
125,It would be interesting to hear your views on how tariffs could be used to address the cost of environmental damage from shipping goods. I.e. impose a tariffs to internalise that externality
126,"Honestly, where tariffs become most enticing is the idea that the income tax could be significantly reduced or eliminated at the federal level. 
Tariffs are by their nature for the average citizen a tax on how they want to live, you can avoid a tariff by not buying the product. Or (In some cases) buying domestic. A tax on income is a tax on producing something in the economy and is unavoidable, what's more, funding the government on tariffs would eliminates the need for income tax returns."
127,Looks like they worked
128,Unfortunately the expensive domestic labor isn’t expensive enough for many people to live comfortably without a large number of roommates.
129,"Mexico and Canada already caved to Trump's tariffs. They work. Of course, the caveat is that not every country has the same leverage as a production superpower like the US or China."
130,"What struck me about this is that timing and context means everything, tariffs worked when there was little industry in the country and it worked again when we had few competitors after WW2. So how do we get better higher paying jobs back in the country, when cheap manufacturing has become so dominant in other parts of the world? In this current context?"
131,"And just like that, the tariffs are gone, with guarantees from both Canada and Mexico to help guard the border. Can tariffs work? They did."
132,It is ironic that the ad read for Grammarly incorrectly used the word “less” when “fewer” should have been used.
133,God we live in the dumbest timeline
134,I love the sheer amount of fancy terms we’ve developed for “hidden tax on poorer people”
135,“Income tax will get whacked” *me who lives in nh where their already is no income tax  
136,"The quick answer is yes. Mexico this morning said they’re temporarily suspending tariffs to negotiate a deal that puts 10,000 Mexican troops on the southern border to help with the border crisis."
137,No. The baboon bancrupted a casino. Saved you 16 minutes.
138,"Here is one thing nobody is ever talking about: price control comes down to the consumers in the end. Everyone is complaining that prices are going to go up because businesses have higher costs now, however the only reason why the prices go up due to this is because of corporate greed who would rather destroy a family and their livelihoods than to decrease their yearly salary. you know 1 billion sounds much better than 900 million. If the customer refuses to purchase what these companies are selling, then now they are forced to drop prices. If they fire people to do it, it will come to a limit since they all have a minimum of employees needed to ensure the production of their goods. aka you can make a product without people to make it. finally leading them to decrease their costs in the only place left, their own pockets. Boycotting works. people today are just weak and comfortable. fighting each other instead of fighting the big boys."
139,Nice to watch something that’s not full of partisan bias
140,"Here I saved you watching the entire stupid video, we the people pay them."
141,"In short as far as Mexico and Canada, so far. Yes."
142,"Customs professional here - regarding the 25% steel imports. Whilst its true  a company simply importing steel (to for example sell) would be subject to 25% duty, most large corporations would take advantage of inward processing procedures, which would drastically reduce the tax burden of the finished product"
143,Tariffs should not be imposed on countries but on certain industries like semiconductors and automobiles.
144,"You're looking at it from a technical perspective. Trump is looking at tariffs as a bargaining tool to get what we wants from the country. For example, Mexico President just folded like a napkin and gave concessions to Trump for a 1 month delay in tariffs on Mexico."
145,🇨🇦🇨🇦 BUY CANADIAN 🇨🇦🇨🇦

149,You forgot to mention they can be used as leverage to negotiate. They worked.
150,"I love the way he uses Google Docs as his default word processing tool, same as me."
151,It’s fun reading all the comments after Trump made Canada & Mexico bend the knee.
152,"They do, Columbia et Mexico caved in in a matter of hours."
153,Working so far
154,"Tarrifs work when we actually produce more products than we export. We need to make more products here in the US (quality products) and and give those products better tax breaks. The better we make things we more people will buy them. Yet if outsourced products are better and cost less tarrifs just make good products more expensive.

I remember back in the 90s made in America was something that mattered. Heck back then I was a Walmart shopper because they promoted their made in America products. Today I avoid Walmart because almost everything is an import.

To regain our dominance in this world we need to produce products that the world want to buy."
155,"Let me get this straight; China, India and Brazil can and should use tariffs to protect their economy and industries, but the US can't? 
LOL! Ok..."
156,Y’all real quiet since his tariffs worked 
157,This is just another example of why the economy is too complicated and fragile to entrust to politicians to play with.
158,"Seems like the best idea would be to have tariffs on luxury items. I'd like to see lower cost of goods needed for daily life, energy, food and housing. Let those that have more money choose to spend it or not on things that are luxuries."
159,"Can tariffs work? Ask mexicos 10000 troops, making thier way to the Mexico border"
160,The tariffs for Canada and Mexico worked!
161,They just did
162,"It’s a common misunderstanding that Lincoln intended to end slavery before the civil war, but it was during the civil war that he decided to do so. He was mainly concerned with preserving the union and it didn’t matter whether or not that included slavery"
163,Just a reminder trump is getting his way with the threat of Tariffs.
164,Thanks Trump
165,"I think you've missed a major economic factor of unemployment rate. With the current US very low unemployment rate of 4.1% tariffs are more likely to backfire since there is very few people available to increase production, thus already high labor costs are likely to only increase. Tariffs make much more sense in an economy where there is lots of people looking for work."
166,Considering the Mexico tariffs have been suspended now that Mexico is deploying 10k soldiers to provide assistance with border security I would say they are definitely working
167,Yep just worked this day. Mexico capitulated and agreed with americas terms.
168,"Dude, were you born yesterday? Were you around Trump's 1st term?? Tariffs was one of the big factors as to why our economy skyrocketed and why we had more money in our pockets in between 2018 and 2020."
169,"This channel is one of the few that I can only watch on 1x speed. Most of the others I can easily speed up to 1.25x - 1.5x, but not this one. It's not a bad thing though, it's just the information density is very high in here."
170,"The thing that conversations tend to miss is that we actually need significant inflation at the moment to keep the Federal debt from snowballing. No one likes that, but in light of the fact that inflation is necessary and inevitable and complex supply chains are already breaking under international tension, tariffs make a lot of sense. The pain is inevitable, the question is if your local industry will be anywhere close to a position to pick up the slack."
171,One thing these comments are missing is if by passing tariffs the government can lower taxes by 25% it might just work. I am a farmer. I pay my taxes for the entire year on march 1. If the rest of the country had pay taxes the way I do there would be a revolution. There is taxes on everything. Everywhere. I am not excited about the uncertainty but the status quo isn’t working either. If we keep doing same thing things will continue to get worse. This is worth a shot in my opinion
172,It's simple. Move your company to the US to avoid the tariffs or stop complaining.
173,Excellent work cheers from London
174,This aged HORRIBLY . Within 24 hours counties are folding to Trumps tariffs.
175,Yet no country wants to be hit by them from The President. The negotiating tactic is working 
176,"So Canada and Mexico bent the knee within 24 hours and did exactly what Trump wanted. This proves my point, that Trump used tariffs (or the threat thereof) as a diplomatic tool, and your economic analysis was interesting but ... irrelevant."
177,"I work in a medical manufacturing and we import most of our things, recently we have started processes that would cause us to produce more of our imported parts in-house. We are prepping to manufacture our own PCBA boards. Thus creating new jobs. The downside I can see from this is that since it will cost us more to build these parts it will absolutely raise the prices of the finished goods."
178,"I know in the short term this will hurt low-income Americans, but in the long term I really do think this will help the lower and middle class of the US regain more control of our nations wealth. We've become addicted to having cheap labor and goods manufactured abroad at the expense of the average American worker. The only thing I'm somewhat hesitant about is tariffs on rare earth elements that we can't exactly mine within our own territory like Lithium or cobalt

Edited for spelling and clarity"
179,"Seems to me the tariffs are already working.  Ask Columbia, Mexico and Canada how it went for them."
180,"Panama folded.
Venezuela folded.
Columbia folded. 
Mexico folded. 
Canada folded. 

...yeah it works."
181,"many people don't like going through the hard times but they enjoy the good times. problem is, i don't know if this is one of those situations that we have to pull through for a better outcome."
182,Hello my favorite Aussie channel
183,"Mexico already agreed to Trump's demand on border protection and security. So yes, they worked."
184,"Bueller, Bueller! 

Ben explained it and MAGA looks just like his class."
185,"Some half truths were told in this video.
Steel temporarily went up in price. After a few months, the price of steel went down. This made products more affordable than before the tariffs."
186,oops they worked 
187,I know tariffs are mostly bad for economies unless used in a very specific and prudent ways. But I'm sure a man that bankrupted himself twice has it all figured out 
188,It worked lol
189,"I cannot tell you how much i despise economic thinking in this day and age. We act like we know everything and then immediately forget about it. This is simple. Tariffs do things, they have pressures, you have to account for those pressures for a tariff or literally any other thing to be accomplished adequately. There. Inflation is an upward pressure. Deflation is a downward pressure. There are steps to achieve either, but we act like we don't know how to do that. The truth is, everyone is a coward. Too scared to say sometimes growth isn't good if it doesn't map to two things. One, real growth, two, human well being."
190,"I was once in the OEM sales department of one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers, handling the sale of parts to some of the world's largest car makers' manufacturing operations in the EU. Although I only had very small pieces of some very big pies, I was dealing with tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers from about 15 different countries... Many of those parts had commonality with those OEM's models in the US. Also dealing with the logistics side of things, it was crazy to see, first hand, just how many different pieces from every corner of the world have to fall in place before a car even starts its journey on the assembly line. I saw Brexit kill some of my customers' operations, so I'm fearful about what happens in the US if these tariffs stay in long term (especially as I now work for a US-bases manufacturing concern)."
191,Your facts and science make my orange god king look dumb so I'm angry and hate this video and all of the factual information espoused in it. Grr rawr angry maga
192,"If you just waited a day, you would have the answer you need shortbus. yep they worked and you wasted a lot of time putting this video together. So close your mouth, open your ears, watch and learn."
193,Short answer: No.
194,"There are plenty of economists (probably a majority) who would confidently make the blanket statement that all tariffs are bad.  Some might walk that back a bit and say there are sometimes exceptional circumstances in which they don't do more harm than good.

Dunno if this says more about tariffs or economists, though."
195,They did.
196,Trump is already mentioning XAI308K in his latest interviews. This coin is going to be BITCOIN 2.0
197,"Around the 11-minute mark, EE starts to briefly go off the rails, saying 'well, we know that tariffs were horrible for the US the last time, but you never know....maybe there's some secret benefits we'll only see years later, based on zero evidence.' Him also talking about Stellantis as a positive automotive conglomerate is hilarious for multiple reasons: 1. It is not a domestic U.S. conglomerate, it was a merger w/ Dodge, Jeep, Chrystler, and several European automakers including Pugeaut. 2. Demand for their vehicles, especially Jeeps, has plummeted, as you can see from Dodges and Jeeps both being THE BOTTOM TWO slowest-selling cars off the lot, as a verifiable fact. 3. The first thing the Stellantis CEO did was announce sweeping pay cuts and layoffs to U.S. workers; More Perfect Union has a great video documenting this, and 4. The quality for Jeeps has cratered, but their MSRPs went up 15+%. He recovers soon after this, but I think he needs to do his due diligence and not make up a steel-man w/ no evidence to attempt to ""both-sides"" this. As an American, I can confirm we're pissed about these tariffs."
198,"12:33 Gotta give Mercedes Benz Vans credit. I worked there for 3 years, and during the pandemic. I can say with full confidence we didn't have shut down like the other automotive companies, We WORKED. They moved mountains so we can keep working. 
2018 MBV became a full production plant, still having to rely on VS20 vans to get to full capacity. When I left MBV in 2023 they were finishing their contract with USPS.
This was before Trump was elected, but because how successful MBV is doing in the US; Mercedes is investing to make their North Charleston plant their 2nd biggest van plant in the world!! 
It's cool to get a shout out, most people don't mention MBV."
199,"When I moved to South Korea in 2010, I was surprised that a Samsung TV was MUCH more expensive than it was in the USA, that's because the major companies here convinced the government to put tariffs on foreign products to ""protect"" them.  However, instead, Samsung just raised the prices for domestic products.  Now with the world based on global and online shipping, it seems their was enough outrage, that these policies were reversed."
200,"The main issue imo is that pay has not increased with the value of the dollar. The more people are able to spend, the better the economy does"
201,"Tariffs primarily impact consumers by leading to higher prices on imported goods, as companies often pass increased costs down the supply chain. While this can create financial strain for consumers in the short term, it may also encourage more mindful spending habits. The high rate of consumerism in the U.S., characterized by frequent purchases of items like new cars and smartphones, contributes to resource overuse and economic dependence on foreign manufacturing. Tariffs could potentially reduce this overconsumption by making imported goods more expensive, thereby promoting longer product lifecycles and supporting domestic industries."
202,Moral of the story: have no tariffs and promote a free world when you have no competitor of factories production like post-WWII
203,"In short: Maybe on the long road, however, in the short term? We'll have to face the economic recoil this will cost and maybe cost us."
204,"they say that theyre going to tax corporations less which will reduce prices of the items they sell because they’ll be able to sell stuff for less with the same profit margins, but they’re doing the exact opposite with tariffs by increasing the companies costs pushing the prices up, and at the end of it all, corporations dont lose any money, and we have to pay more because of the tariffs"
205,"Something that is often overlooked is the impact on currency. If the us dollar increases as a result of tarrifs and others decrease (as mexico and Canadas has  already) this helps US purchasing power of OS goods.

Companies in targetted country always eats some of the tarrif as well, particullarly when the market in the US is so lucrative."
206,Great explanation!
207,"Economists don’t differentiate between the economy and its workers. If stocks go up because jobs get exported, economists say that’s good. Tariffs are meant to protect domestic industry from external cheap labor and prevent jobs being exported."
208,"Running an appliance repair business. Those 2018 tariffs hurt our industry pretty bad. 
It wasn’t just China. South Korea as well. I’ve makers for LG frenchdoor fridges went from $60 to $240 in like one day. If those tariffs worked then lg would have seen a smaller market share in appliances, but their market share grew in the period following those tariffs. It did nothing, because we produce nothing to little to satisfy demand."
209,"I understand it is difficult to grasp, but tariffs are not there for their short-term effect. They are there to push change to the local industry and that can take decades to happen. Especially in western countries who have grown complacent and have forgotten how to manufacture basic products."
210,"yes, indeed, and we have seen them work within the last day. Both Mexico and Canada have acquiesced to Trump‘s recommendations and has lift for 30 days in order to see if these two countries were making progress with their agreements. One interesting point is with the agreement concerning Mexico, Trump needs to stop or significantly reducethe flow of high-powered weapons from the USA to the Mexican cartels. It will be interesting to see if he can get this done. Either way, this is all working out for the benefit of the American people."
211,Please do a video on the costs of tariffs vs increasing corporate taxes
212,"Tariffs are good for the people collecting the additional costs.
And bad for the consumer who is paying for the tariffs."
213,They already have by the day after this video released. They were a negotiation piece.
214,I just don’t want any taxes taken out of my check 
215,"Thanks for the video, very thorough explanation."
216,Perfect non-biased perspective on terrifs
217,"TLDR 
Tariffs great for the wealthy, and not for mid and lower income households. Businesses have never pass the savings on to their customers. It just means they get to keep more money if capital income taxes are removed."
218,The thing is. Tarifs only agect you if you buy the imported products... if you want to buy a Mercedes then you will be hit with the tarif but if you are happy with your Ford then not...
219,You may want to update your video. The tariffs worked as expected. It has always been about reducing the number of drug (including fentanyl) and other trafficking.
220,Nice work. Should be mandated viewing everyone. Especially the US.
221,Great video. One thing kinda glossed over was it matters what country is being impacted and what we import from them. In this case we are using tariffs as a strong arm move to give us negotiating power. Because the US can withstand the import losses where as Canada and Mexico will struggle. This is meant to push china out while putting pressure on mexico and canda for future relations and negotiations.
222,Very informative. Thanks.
223,excellent presentation
224,You forgot to mention that tariffs best help by lightening the pockets of the inhabitants of the country applying the tariff. so that the exporting country can indirectly add it to their inhabitants.
225,The problem that isn’t being talked about is the fact that tariffs on other countries = import prices go through the roof. The consumer is going to pay the price.
226,"Completely unrelated but I had mid roll ads, I’m paying YouTube for a ad free experience yet 80% of the content I consume run some time of mid roll ad."
227,"Another issue with regard to tariffs is the impact on labor alternatives.   The US economy is a highly diverse economy, with world leading service, information and finance sectors.  Unemployment in manufacturing intensive regions is low, particularly in newly industrialized areas with modernized facilities like the US Carolinas and in Texas.  In these areas, the biggest concern for manufacturers is the availability of workers, when a production worker can receive equivalent compensation in the service sector.   The fed has shown that the wage premium for production workers no longer exists.   So a raise in tariffs would raise the competition for production workers to meet increased demand.   This would drive up the price of workers in all sectors.   As Friedman noted: a tariff is a tax on the many for the benefit of the few."
228,The irony of doing an ad read for Grammarly and using less emails instead of fewer emails.
229,"This video gets all the right points. For the tariffs to work, local production must also be there are is competitive with imports after pricing adjustments.

The US currently lacks this, and any local manufacturing most likely still won't be competitive with imports after tariffs.

In short, this is just a tax on the public and little else."
230,very informative thank you !
231,"Good to see a proper take on tarrifs. What you said about domestic industry needing to be competitive if tarrifs are used is precisely why ""Trust busting"" was a thing. Monopolies and cartels are bad for a market and they develop far faster when a country's industry is protected. To maximize the benefits of tarrifs you need to combine it with anti trust legislation. Generally, tarrifs on raw materials for example are really bad for an economy as they're a major business input. They serve more industries than it would protect. This again means that if you actually look at what industries a tarrif protects (the taxed industry) and the industries that rely on that you can see pretty clearly if it'll be a net positive for the economy. Also for tariffs to work they need to blanket. The only countries not hit by the tarrif should not be hit because they are economically similar and directly coordinating with your country. Otherwise they'll just be circumvented and everyone loses."
232,"Before watching the video, I'm going to say no they don't work.
30 seconds in ""if it worked for the USA once"" ... It didn't. That's a big reason we had the great depression."
233,"Tariffs also play well to a domestic audience. Threaten a tariff, exact a minor concession, and then exalt the purported political gains at home. It’s naive to think that Trump doesn’t understand the inflationary impacts and, frankly, stupid to think that he would risk a politically disastrous inflationary outbreak. 

Take Mexico. He threatened tariffs, negotiated a “last minute” political accommodation from Mexico on border control, and will now claim that he achieved more in four days than Biden achieved in four years. This will play well politically."
234,"America is one of the most prosperous nations in the history of the world. Why people are so doubtful is astonishing to me, look at the tariffs we put on Mexico and Canada, they immediately slapped us with there own and what happened to there currency…tanked. We have some of the best products in the world and comment thread economists know best"
235,Great insights!
236,The only thing that I like about the tariffs is that it pushes the US away from the child labor and poor wages that China emposes.
237,"I don't know. People have been complaining about wage stagnation for a long time now. Tariffs should theoretically work in bringing jobs back domestically increasing the demand of domestic labor, theoretically increasing the cost of labor meaning wages should go up. Frankly even with all the issues outlined in the video this seems like a better angle than artificially increasing minimum wage which compresses the wages of jobs but doesn't necessarily raise them all. Min wage also reduces manufacturing in the US as well as almost all of economic history suggesting price floors are bad."
238,It takes some time to change over. I don't think even 7 years is a long enough term to really bring domestic competition up.
239,"So how do you rebalance tariffs between countries? If you have low import tariffs on foreign goods but that country has high tariffs on your goods they import to protect their local production. How can you rebalance that? 

Genuine question"
240,"Getting rid of the hassle of starting businesses would be good here, along with regulations that hurt the efficiency and profitability of us businesses"
241,"11:00 legislation was the major player over tarrifs for current light truck rules, since MOCA (I think that's how it's spelled) legislation means less innovation is done for light trucks, reducing design and manufacturing costs relative to other cars."
242,Do we have any examples of tariff use that dodge the short-term pains but still result in the long-term gains that are desired from imposing such measures?
243,One thing that you didn't address here: Tariffs used as a political tool.
244,I got an ad about Economics Explained guy right when i clicked on the video. Wow.
245,"That US tuck market is awesome! As soon as I find an extra 80k laying around, I'm gonna get one!"
246,"We can debate how the overall economy will be affected, there is no reality in which prices don't increase for consumers. It is essentially just a regressive sales tax on consumers."
247,"Short answer: Tariffs work on specific litigation like steel, oil, certain goods, etc. Tariffs wars have never worked since over 100 years because most economies are now integrated. Its always a lose lose process. Always.
Its in every economic literature you can consult."
248,I was told tariffs also drove us further into the great depression because it was used as a tool to generate tax revenue for the government. If this is true how does that factor into the discussion?
249,"Who will Trump blame for the down fall? 
A: DEI 
B: Immigrants 
C:Democrats 
D:Biden"
250,So how's it going?
251,"The issue is that these are long term solutions, not short term. This is about reorientating things away from global supply chains which disproprionately negatively affect the developed world."
252,"Blanket tarrifs do have a use... To prep an economy for a war or embargo or basically to prevent a ""cold turkey"" situation"
253,"I swear I'm going to need to make my kids do their homework on my old Win XP laptop with Office 2003, so they can learn how to use grammar and spelling before they get too used to crutches like Grammarly. They can start using Grammarly when they get to college."
254,"Industries are today highly specialized making it quite difficult to replace imported high quality industrial products. On would need a factory, tooling, automation, skilled workers etc. It just doesn’t happen overnight."
255,I got an ad for your documentary on this video 
256,Is the price to consumers offset by lower income taxes? How much?
257,The argument is that Tariffs will create more jobs in the USA for working class people. That is the point of Tarrifs. It isn't to make goods cheaper. Its to give people more opportunities in down run areas. As long as Economists keep ignoring the point they will continue to look like fools.
258,"If tariffs don’t work across the board, then why is Mexico and Canada threatening retaliatory tariffs? If it merely becomes a de facto tax passed onto its own citizens and has no effect on the target country, why respond at all?"
259,Answer: Yes.
260,Thank you !
261,"At 1:02 a picture of my hometown, Pittsburgh. Looking at downtown from across the Monongahela just past a brew pub called the Sly Fox on Great Allegheny Passage street. Thanks."
262,"Correction at 5:30.  The Southern aristocracy believed Lincoln wanted to end slavery.  Lincoln, however, made it perfectly clear through countless letters and discussions that he would NOT END slavery if that was going to cause the South to secede.  The Southern aristocrats WANTED to secede and they used him as their excuse."
263,Going the entire video without calling this a regressive tax is a crime
264,i hear audi and bmw are talking about building cars in usa to avoid tarriffs
265,"I'd pay a significant tax if it meant that no more fentanyl got into the US. I'm not sure if this will actually be the result, but it's a major reason behind these tariffs that is getting lost in all of this."
266,Thank YOU for giving us an informative breakdown of tariffs free of politically-charged BS
267,3:12 You can’t make one of these graphs without pointing out deadweight loss. They’re made to show it…
268,"The problem with these calculations is that almost everything ""made in the USA"" uses imported raw materials, components, or sub-assemblies. That means that tariffs make domestic goods less competitive and more expensive as well as imported goods. Global supply chains have become so interdependent that almost nothing is ""made in"" a single country."
269,Can you make a video on the benefits or not of a cyrpto reserve for a country?
270,You also miss the fact of big corporations like Apple and Meta moving their profits into Ireland for its low company tax rates. Which appears to be another way to get around tariffs anyway.  Fyi. Laurie. NZ. 
271,"If the tariffs apply for crude oil, it will show at the gas station, in 2022 the US did import nearly half of its oil from Canada."
272,"Better update the video after Trudeau's recent announcement.  Which begs the question, isn't it a leverage playing card to get what you want? Tarrifs is a negotiation process."
273,very well put video
274,"Mexico already came to an agreement that puts 10,000 Mexican troops on the border. Columbia came to the table real quick too. Id say yes they work."
275,"Right. So tell me why all of my ""USA"" products (DeWalt, Apple,) is actually ""made in China"" or. How comes when i try to buy something from the US where the prices are pretty competitive, but then the Shipping cost is so high it makes the whole purchase nonsense?"
276,"When a tariff is imposed, jobs are NOT magically created. In fact, according to Henry Hazzlitt and other economists, the jobs are simply redirected to the industries where the tariff is being imposed. Consumers must spend more money on the increased prices for that specific industry, thus decreasing the amount of money they can spend on other products. This means that businesses in other American industries suffer, decreasing the number of jobs there. In conclusion, tariffs don't create jobs, they simply move jobs from a more efficient domestic industry to a less efficient one."
277,"with the whole thing about annexing canada, mexico and greenland, the tariffs are meant to be as disruptive and hurtful as possible. and this won't be the end of it"
278,"I have some questions. Isn't the point of tariffs to encourage more companies to manufacture in the US, which would improve our industry, create jobs, and make us less dependent on foreign manufacturing? I'm not sure there's anyone arguing that tariffs are intended to drive consumer end prices down. Also, and we will have to wait and see what happens, but isnt the other intention of tariffs to replace our current federal funding mechanism? Like, reduce or eliminate income tax and revert back to pre 1913? I'm all for spending a little more on goods if i get to keep more of my income, assuming a net benefit. This would depend on your spending habits i assume but that comes down to personal choice. Im just not seeing the reason for debating a point no one disagrees with. Am i missing something?"
279,"Shipping products to a middleman country is actually illegal. The country of origin is where it's made, not where it ships from. Some do take the risk of interloading to avoid tariffs but if caught, there's some serious penalties and potentially jail time."
280,Domestic producers: yay perfect timing! we have an excuse to increase price to match the tariffs and get better revenue this year
281,"For me, I am just not seeing a large scale industrial policy wherein the tariffs can work as a tool to encourage the growth of good paying jobs here at home. Let's take something super mundane: drywall screws. A box of about 500 is going to cost you ~15 dollars or so, give or take depending on quality and brand. The profit margin per screw is stupidly small. No company that makes those screws is going to move stateside, even with tarrifs, because the baseline production cost at home is too high for such a low value-add product. 

Cars, of course, are very much a high value add and might be a good thing to have tariffs to discourage offshoring the production to some other nation, but, if it is still cheaper even with tariffs then the move will still happen. Tariffs, by themselves, won't be enough to convince companies to return to the states"
282,"So I feel that tariffs are going to be devastating. 1. What is to say Trump stops at China, Canada, and Mexico and not hit other important countries. 2. China pulling out and we lose a ton of objects that we depend on.
3. Other countries see this and start boycotting objects that they can make or get somewhere else cheaper (like the boycott of US liquor in some Canadian provinces).
I hope I am wrong...."
283,"Que raro es ver que USA se Peronice considerando que tiene la posibilidad de ver sus resultados. Igualmente, si esta dispuesto a bajar impuestos locales al mismo tiempo de aplica tarifas quizas funcione a medias su plan. Pero considerando que su primer idea para obtener competitividad fue aplicar tarifas en vez de reducir impuestos lo veo complicado. Al final el resultado sera que empeore su productividad. Para mi esto puede terminar como predijo Parravicini (ojala me equivoque)."
284,"The previous traiffs were relatively short term. Not long enough to bring production back home. Hopefully, this time they'll work. If not oh well, we cam change plans"
285,"And you haven’t mentioned a possibility (quite high in my opinion) that even if foreign investors are forced to manufacture in the US, the cost of US labour is so high that it justifies very high use of robots instead of humans. I heard from multiple sources that outside of significant reduction of income in the US, it is most likely that those manufacturing jobs will never return."
286,Try US shipbuilding industry. Jone's act did number on that one.
287,Tariff Is 'the Most Beautiful Word'
288,"Why isn't the extended benefit of those 1800 washing machine jobs ever explored? (taxes on those jobs [Income, sales], suppliers that make the parts for the dryers, local economy of those manufacturing plants). Your example is too simplistic. It's why economist will say tariffs are bad but then say they are not really sure what will happen."
289,Tariffs worked during Trimp's  first term
290,The formation of the USA was also about tarrifs between states. So why should nations should have tarrifs between themselves? Why should certain nations discriminate others?
291,"Just in case none of you know the U.S. can't use the oil it produces, it has to export oil it can't process and import processed oil."
292,We made the Mercedes packs in Alabama also. I was there doing it in 2012
293,Guess we're just going to have to learn to fix our broken washing machines... Luckily we have plenty of YouTube creators that can help with that!
294,"Uh… no… the only thing that’s gonna happen is that imported items are gonna increase in price, so then the local product increase their prices accordingly to match the imported competitors for an increase in revenue, then no one can afford eggs."
295,So swinging a wrench around aimlessly won’t help you fasten a nut or screw?
296,Youn skipped right over the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930 which of course had major impacts on the great depression not only in the US and Canada but world wide.

301,Watching American politics as a foreigner has turned from light comedy to slow burn horror.
302,"Tarriffs make products more expensive. Making them more expensive, they should just be a repellent for people to away from the products that are under the power. Therefore it should just decrease the amount of products being purchased"
303,Can anyone suggest me some books related to macro economics to get better understanding of it
304,"Also not every import or export is a consumer good. What happens to services US exports ? I think it will backfire heavily. More surgical tariffs on specific product categories may be reasonable, though"
305,Seems to me that there should be policy preventing US companies from raising costs as explained in the washing machine example
306,"Instead of just asking and theorising he's doing it to see if it can or not, so the best awnser is to just wait and see what happens. Because then it's been field tested."
307,I bet this youtuber is a proponent of trickle down economics
308,Can we just acknowledge how weird it is that the lower taxes party is supporting tariffs now while the higher taxes party is supporting taxes on everything except imports now?
309,"i think the part where it fucks it all up is when the domestic company raises to match the tariffed product.......if both washing machines start at $485, but then bc of the tariff, japan brand needs to go up to $675. By also going up to $675 all the american company is doing is forcing the entire market to consider if they really need a new washer and then making it unimportant to the consumer of where it came from. But if they would leave their price at $485, well now everyone is buying not only the cheaper option but the one MADE IN AMERICA. Now american production can grow, the company add jobs and now all that new money added to the market from those new employees goes on to raise sales and profits for other brands"
310,"Tariffs could work, over time, if we exempt raw materials and tools used in the manufacturing process itself, while eliminating income taxes or sales taxes on US goods."
311,We need to focus on driving the cost of living as low as possible. Which would drive labor cost down and bring in more jobs
312,"I remember back 60 years or so when electronics, appliances, cars, steel and a whole lot of other products were made in the USA. Suddenly we started seeing these same products start coming into the US from companies over seas, that were of very high quality but at significantly lower prices. People aren't dumb. When they have a choice, they will choose a lower priced high quality product over a higher priced lessor quality product most of the time. So what happens? American manufacturers start leaving America and moving over seas, taking with them all the jobs that were currently here. Sure, tariffs are going to hurt in the short term but maybe that is what it s going to take to start bringing jobs back to the US."
313,The only way I can see this benefiting United Statians is if there is a proportional reduction in income tax.. Which is a stated goal of the pres.. The reduced bureaucratic load on companies could also have a significant impact on United Statian's ability to focus on production/progress.  So hoping for our neighbors that the gov follows through with step 2 of that plan..
314,Ask Herbert Hoover.  He signed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs into existence at the start of the depression. I think everyone knows how that ended!
315,"Swapped out $8,000 to my XAI308K wallet. Thanks you guys see you at the summit."
316,"Tariffs, like all economic tools is incredibly complex. Certainly it has been demonstrated that the outcome is often unexpected. In the case of American tariffs, what is confusing is that they unusually benefited from it. Combine the dollar world order with the ""cheap"" imports. The American consuners were the winners. Work will not return. It will be automated, meaning a few people will get rich whike the rest will pay more and rven have less jobs available. Look luck America."
317,nice information but what solution do you offer
318,"He should be targeting American companies that go abroad for cheap labour and materials, but these companies are just going to move plants or relabel stuff as said in the video and thus avoiding the tariff, without however charging the end customer the tariff price."
319,"Great video! I know you are trying to just cover tariffs, but if you wanted to make an ACTUAL part 2 without the geo-politics, you could get into subsidies (the anti-tariff). This would be great to cover to highlight that another use of tariffs is to combat subsidies, and this is another thing the WTO has been working towards along side the reduction is tariffs and that's a reduction in subsidies."
320,Stephen Miran seems like a smart guy and a key advisor to Trump on tariffs.  It’s all above my head but he explains the main benefit as lowering the value of the dollar and making manipulating currencies against it harder.
321,"I can't help but notice this is literally just a re-write of the Wall Street Journal's video? Like, exactly the same? 
You have just copied and posted it now because it is relevant again."
322,Economic co-dependency between major power like China & USA is probably the only reason a war hasn't happened. There is probably more at risk here than more expensive washing machines.
323,Tarifs worked a century ago when globalization did not exist and the international exchange was very small... Which is not the case now
324,It’s about having those countries do what the big one wants. China does this as well
325,Guess we're about to find out.
326,"the VAST majority of government funding should come trough tariffs / vat and corporate taxation, plus a taxation on land. NOT trough income tax ... as it was intended .."
327,"I think a lot of this , or at least I'm hoping, this is to shine a light on the fact that nearly everyone tarriffs our exports but wants to import for free and that shouldnt be the case. Im also hopeful this increases anerican labor. I understand there are downsides but this can be played right so lets be hopeful that the outcome will be better for us. Bottom line is something has to change and im atleast hopeful now that someone is trying a change"
328,:57 intensification is an argument to determine and establish a tariff
329,Not a single Trump voter will watch this and they wouldn't even understand it. They're too busy losing money on the Trump meme coin.
330,Trump only had to levy tariffs on Canada and Mexico for five minutes…
331,"Gotta think about how tariffs impact a world where 3D printing, AI and robotics have taken over. What are the possibilities?"
332,Great video
333,"I thought tariffs are only applied against products and not countries. Can you explain the principle of ""Most favoured nation"" and how it applies to Trumps tariff strategy?"
334,You guys did a great analysis on XAI308K in your other video. I agree it will hit $100 by December this year.
335,Your other video mentioned XAI308K being the #1 investment this year. While i do agree can you provide insight on XRP and it's projections?
336,"Tariffs only work if you eliminate income tax at the same time. I'd rather offset income taxes with tariffs and choose what I buy and when I buy it. If income taxes don't get eliminated, then it'll be a horrible mistake."
337,I believe they can work one at a time but to many at once will be a major disruption.
338,"Tarriffs will make the citizens work hard and learn how to not rely everything from the outside, this is good way for citizens to build its own unique culture."
339,"I think 11:45 is a huge key here. Tariffs reduce international competition, so if there's enough competition in domestic industry then they can work. That requires restrictions on large corporations while allowing smaller ones to flourish.

The issue is trump is pro-corporation, and we have several domestic monopolies + tariffs. Plus trump has no idea what America's accessible natural resources are - those are the industries we should be targeting with tariffs. We're about to get much shittier, much more expensive products while the government and domestic CEOs get tons of money through ""indirect taxes""."
340,Smart move. Being that it's new XAI308K will probably hit $0.60 usd by Winter 2025 and next year will boom to like $25. Glad we got in early.
341,"People try to predict the economy not realizing it is not a capitalistic market, its a command economy, central planning! my concern is, instead of having much dollar in bank that could lose value to inflation, do I save in gold to reserve and grow wealth for now, or just hang on?"
342,"Yes it can, because Mexico just caved in and agreed to Trumps terms."
343,Tariffs worked great in the 60s and 70s we had All-American products American made cars no Chinese or Japanese junk . People in their forties and younger don't even understand how tariffs work
344,It works.
345,"Tarrifs are bad. That is why most people would never support tarrifs between villages in the same town, cities in a region or regions in a country."
346,"The case for tariffs in the 19th-century was not very convincing.  In fact, one could even argue that tariffs were to blame for the outbreak of the Civil War."
347,"Its about reshoring jobs, not dollars and cents. The benefit is down the road. Just like the issues with sending the jobs across the world took years to manifest, fixing it will too."
348,"India continues to be protectionist in key industries but I don’t know that local players have stepped up to compete, they just don’t have a need to. I don’t think the productivity increases from protectionism are guaranteed unless it’s a well thought out plan, and local companies don’t use them as an excuse to take their foot off the gas. It’s consumers that suffer in these cases. I’m thinking of high end electronics and computer parts,  EVs in India’s case…"
349,You may want to look at the Smoot-Hawley tariff act of 1930 and compare it to what DonOLD is doing today.
350,"You haven’t talked about outsourcing == brain drain. Anytime you outsource a job, the outsourcee gains the skill and experience, and the outsourceor gets rusty…. This multiplies over time… eventually, the outsourceor’s skills and tools are outdated, and the outsourcee’s skills and tools are at the bleeding edge of innovation. I’ve never heard this mentioned in economic theory, but I’ve seen it played out in the optics industry. Tariffs can be a tool to mitigate this brain drain. Tarrifs are an easy way to encourage local companies to not outsource. Especially for new and high tech individuals where a competitive advantage is beneficial."
351,"A secondary implication is the degradation of diplomatic relationships between countries.

 As long as ive been alive, canada and the US have been great allies and have had a gpod relationship. It's too bad that that's jeopardized now."
352,"13:59 ""cheap domestic labor"" is such a cowardly economist way of not saying slavery"
353,"The point isn't to reduce taxes, it's to make the current tax system less progressive, taking more money from the people that must spend the majority of their paychecks on consumer goods."
354,"Honestly, Mexico, Canada, the EU and whoever else should just deal with the tariffs, put on proportionate retaliatory ones and wait him out. He probably wouldn't keep them going four years if it meant sky-high inflation, but even if he did, the next president wouldn't. As painful as a recession is, I'm sure the concessions he's demanding are also awful and would last longer. In the meantime, like-minded countries should decouple and reduce reliance on the US."
355,Do a video on land value taxes please!
356,"By what basis can you say that the necessary tax surplus would not be created?  This also isn't being done to lower income tax, it is being done to ELEMINATE federal income taxation and that is a very big distinction.  Getting a 25-30% pay increase will offset a 10-15% increase in the price of SPECIFIC goods.  If you are dramatically impacted economically by that increase in goods prices even with increased pay then you are already in a terminal financial situation no matter what happens.  This also ignores the insane bloat and corruption of the federal budget.  Once that is reigned in the overall cost required to keep the federal government functioning will be dramatically reduced.  China is also an adversarial nation in rapid decline, who has basically declared war so decoupling from them economically is also an important strategy."
357,"when there is no competition the quality will drop, in Iran we have cars that you would die with 95% chance if you have a accident more than 80 km per hrs, 60 mph"
358,You have to consider the real motive of the tariffs. Its personal gains and power that comes with money. They want people to pay more.
359,"Weaken demand, weaken rates, weaken dollar, increase exports, increase debt, increase risk on assets. Rough 2 years, boom next 2 years."
360,You’re right we should just keep shipping all domestic production to foreign countries. Gotta make that graph go up no matter what.
361,What if you take the money made from the tariffs and use it to subsidize domestic manufacturing.
362,"To EVERY U.S. importer: Band together and ""Just Don't Pay"" any tariff, new or old, ever again. There is safety in numbers."
363,"It's egregious how, in the discussion of tariffs, raising the wages of U.S. citizens so they can maintain purchasing power is not even mentioned. 

This makes the Trump-imposed tariffs not only a global swindle, it also contributes to more ecological damage due to the middleman country tactic used to mitigate the tarrif price increase."
364,"Old news , they already worked."
365,"I think there maybe two things you did not take into consideration, I could be wrong. 
1: does this negatively effect China’s product dumping? 
2: is the hurt that American consumers feel less than what Chinese producers feel?"
366,"You missed out the benefit businesses would gain from lower energy prices, that would probably negate alot of what you talked about."
367,"Trump’s tariffs may create some feel-good moments in the short term, the lasting impact could be slower economic growth, higher costs for consumers, and job losses in industries that depend on international markets. It's the classic example of a policy that looks good on paper but might do more harm than good over time."
368,"I was hoping your video would be a little more in-depth. Unfortunately, you only focus on USA tariffs. It would have been nice if you included current cost of tariffs that all countries charge the USA."
369,Pretty obvious the threat of them can.
370,"So far colombia, panama and mexico had bend their knees. Looking good. For Trudeau, i dont know. Looks like he doesnt know what he’s doing, looking forward for polievre’s leadership."
371,"Yes, they can."
372,"Tariffing raw materials and energy seems like it’s always bad, since everything u make needs raw material and energy and u want to be able to buy those as cheap as possible"
373,Competition is needed and to gain more competition you need less regulation to entice people to start a business. Red tape detours competition.
374,"I got the weirdest add i have ever seen in YT an add about this very channel playing in this channel, never once seen an add well advertise about itself on its own channel "
375,Do you ha e references to The FED papper of washing machines?
376,"So far he's not using tariffs like that, he's using them as a punishment for not doing what he asks."
377,"""it would increase costs for the consumer with out bringing jobs back to America, which is the whole point"" no... the point is to justify income tax cuts which have a net negative for 90% of the population, pretty neutral effects for another 5-9% leaving the top 1% to maybe top 5% to save millions a year, each, while consumers pay a disproportionately high percentage of their income to the government, through tariffs."
378,"For me, the only real argument is national defense. Being cut off from something like semiconductors would be a disaster for the US so it would make sense in an industry like that. But blanket tariffs are just insane.

Another point, I heard Tim Cook explaining why Apple still produces in China, and it isn't because of cost but expertise and infrastructure. He claims the US has nowhere close to level of expertise than China has. This is something that takes years to cultivate. Idk, maybe you can make the argument it's better in 10 years but that's a big ""if"""
379,"With that many components involved, relying solely on US manufacturing just isn’t feasible. Global supply chains exist for a reason."
380,"Tariffs worked back in the 1800s, but supply chains are global right now. There are some things we simply cannot and never will be able to produce, mine, or grow at scale to satisfy even domestic demand (notably, much of our semiconductor business, which literally powers virtually every electronic product we own and use to live). I wouldn't be opposed to imposing tariffs on China - their state-sponsored companies can steal industry secrets, their goods are often priced to undercut competition, and they undermine US manufacturing as a result. However, there are certain things we simply cannot mine or produce at the scale of China, most importantly rare earth metals which are necessary for virtually every motorized or electric device we use. Even if we started a vast device recycling program, the price of actually extracting and refining those materials for reuse would likely be just as if not more expensive than just buying from china at higher prices."
381,I can't imagine people preferring to use grammarly rather than just learning how to write for themselves.
382,I don't think he inhaled or exhaled the entirety of explaining
383,Not sure how true.  You are I’ve been working in a steel mill for 25 years. And those tariffs really helps us out. China has been dumping. Steel  and many other products here for years.  99 percent of the time it’s poor quality. Compared to. What we make.
384,Economists don’t hate tariffs… it’s a study of economic activity
385,Canada and Mexico joining BRICS would be game over
386,"Short answer no, long answer noooooo!"
387,Why did Canada not build its own LNG plants and oil export facilities? Why did Canada tie itself to the USA for all its export routes?
388,"Key point (specifically with regards to businesses passing the rising costs due to tariffs onto consumers): the power ALWAYS lies with the customers.
Businesses are faced with two options; raise the prices to pay tariffs, or move to the US. 
WE WANT THEM TO MOVE PRODUCTION TO THE US. NOT RAISE PRICES.
so how do we do it? DON'T BUY EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS. 
If you pay the higher prices you have nobody to blame but yourself for the higher costs. 
Don't blame the government, because tarrifs have the potential of being a FANTASTIC solution to fixing all the inflation that the democrats create through creating a greater divide between the poor and the wealthy. But it will never work if we keep giving these companies our money rather than forcing them to be better. 
We have the opportunity to help pay off all the debts, fix the money printing problem that the last administration plagued us with, which will in turn lower inflation. 
But we have to be vigilant.
If you don't buy from foreign companies that raise their prices, they will be forced to comply and help the economy, if you DO buy from them, you are giving into these greedy companies and you are the sole reason for your own higher cost of living. NOT the tariffs.
Tarrifs are great, it is us, the people, that are contributing to rising costs.
You don't need to our financial education to see that, just think about it simply. If you were a business and were faced with tariffs to import to the US, would you raise the prices so you didn't have to lose profit, or would you move your factories to the US? The answer is simple. Unless you are forced to do so, you're going to keep manufacturing over seas and save your bottom line. So its up to us to force them to move to USA to continue making profits. DON'T BUY PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES (until they eventually give in and move to US to remain competitive).
It's not an anti-foreginers thing, it's a pro-economy thing. If you want to be able to afford food, then force the supply chain to drop prices by only buying American. They will set up shop in USA, and create job opportunities and it will be a much better thing for the world then them trying to be as cheap as possible and passing those costs down to you thus draining the economy."
389,MAGA will do the job.
390,"Phase 1: Tariffs
Phase 2: ????
Phase 3: Profit"
391,"If us put tariff on China alone us citizen can survive its after effects.. But its  3 countries, mainly 2 are neighboring"
392,"11:14 Light trucks have higher profit margins because they aren't held to the same standards as other vehicles.

That tariff is there because Europe put a tariff on our chickens."
393,"Tariff only burden customers if they purchase the good - the short term complication, but long term is more beneficial, it will reduce demands (mean it will get cheaper, it also balance the wealth as only rich will purchase it), it also in long term create necessity thus rising of domestic products..brace yourselves for the short term hiccup, save your money only for necessary items."
394,"The short of it: ""No""

The long of it: ""Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"""
395,At least this man is trying to fix our massive debt problem. Caused by being ripped off by everybody
396,"It's already working, 2 fast growing Canadian companies just announced they are moving to america"
397,"Short answer: No
Long answer:NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO"
398,"I'm super against paying for foreign made goods when they treat them like slaves. I much prefer to pay for products where the people in the supply chain are not stressed about money, whatever that amount is for them."
399,"5:45 Wait-wait-wait! Why do you fast forward through the Great Depression?
The Hawley–Smoot Tariff from a hundred y.a. that caused retaliatory tariffs from other countries and did nothing but worsen the depression? I wanted to see that since the situation now is somewhat similar."
400,"Let's hope Trump will be careful with his tariffs. However, something needed to be done about Mexico and especially Canada, so I get why we're here Today. Protect your country from criminals and dictators, important and warranted move from Trump there."
401,"Perhaps im ignorant but its very clear why he put such strong tarrifs on Canada and Mexico. Its because they are the main foreign suppliers of crude oil for the U.S.A. Trump has always been about targeting energy back to the U.S. this will force America to reinvigorate the production of energy (oil) which is the basis for manufacturing. 

The energy price to operate far succeeds the wage difference. If manufacturing companies in the U.S save on energy then they will actually be able to afford the wages needed to pay the workers....at least this is what is hoped.

This isnt a battle about avacados, onions, and candian  alcholol this is about jumpstarting oil production in the USA.

Good idea or bad? I have no clue...."
402,Of course they can work. They are how the U.S. financed the federal government from the beginning until 1913. Tariffs and excise taxes. What happened in 1913? The U.S. got its first federal income tax.
403,"I'm curious why this video was only from the USA perspective.  What happened in Europe or China?  If another country is ""playing"" unfairly, for example China subsidizing an industry to kill international competition, don't tariffs make sense in that case?  You can't compete if the other company gets free money from their government."
404,"Did tariff's actually work in the past for the U.S. , didn't tariffs make the great depression even worse than it already was ?"
405,But couldn’t many of those negative effects of the tariffs had also been from COVID and data is being miss represented in those studies? I would not be surprised if a necessary industry like steel would have kept going but I remember that on many sites our company was on building just stopped. You would also think most businesses using steel in factories that made non-essential goods would have experienced the same thing. And there was a huge squeeze on jobs then generally.
406,Tariffs cannot decrease purchasing power without extortion. This is a law of all trades and economies.
407,"And after all that, the Chinese products will still provide more value for consumers after price hike"
408,Every tariffs works but all of them is a two edged sword.
409,Making our own steel is more important than making dryers
410,People really exposing themselves confidently saying “tariffs don’t work”
411,"It only hurts consumers. Companies just push the extra cost ""tax"" to the consumers.. nothing changes besides consumers paying 3x for the same thing"
412,My opinion on XAI308K it will reach double digits heights may take time but the hand writing is on the wall
413,"We should place a tariff on internet traffic.
That'll show em!"
414,Make prices higher again!
415,"South American here - where inflation isn't just a concept, it's a way of life. Once prices go up, they never come back down, that's the new normal, even if inflation slows. Seems like a wake-up call for my American friends. Right now, the president here has a 49% disapproval rate despite record-high employment and inflation under 4%. Why? Because the cost of basic goods is still sky-high. Be careful what you wish for."
416,Tariffs could boost eco make foreign product prices rise and local products stay same.
417,But if something is produced in America with American materials then prices won’t increase right?
418,They already have.
419,YALL VOTED FOR THIS!!!
420,Calling it an indirect tax because costs go up is pretty distorted.
421,"depending on how much tariffs impact, i still might prefer them over income tax.
i have the freedom to choose not to buy the more expensive product. i do NOT have the freedom to avoid paying income taxes."
422,It is causing a stock market crash which is not a good thing right now.
423,"It depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to an across-the-board tax on your population to raise money so you can lower taxes on rich people, then yes, they work."
424,I got my XAI308K wallet setup and got in for $7500. Great video 
425,"Flat Tariffs are stupid, adaptive Tariffs are way better were you increase the price a little bit so then Domestic and oversea goods are closer in price so it's easier to chose local but the cheaper option is still there."
426,"Yikes, this went up like what 6 hours before they worked with mexico doing what the president wanted. So yes, to save people time of watching they do work."
427,"yeah but big companies can get even more recording record profits, record profits that have never been so record"
428,"Oh boy, those eggs are gonna be real cheap now. Thanks to MAGA's daddy Trump."
429,"Phase 1: collect underpants 
Phase 2:
Phase 3: profit"
430,I just found it weird how countries who have their own unfair tarrifs are now complaining about tariffs. Just seems hypocritical.
431,"Did you know that tariffs can bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for the US government in a short period of time? Although such money is paid by US import companies, it does bring in some revenue for the US government, taking money out of the pockets of ordinary people."
432,"Tariffs on luxurie goods a probably fine. Stuff like food, hygiene, healthproducts and so on should probably best left alone."
433,"I’m no economist, but didn’t the gilded age, where robber barons and monopolies ran amuck, end in the Great Depression?"
434,spoiler... it did... mexico will be sending troops to secure the border
435,"Tl:dr
The US industrial economy was boosted by two world wars, helping rebuild Europe & the booming car and home electronic industry.

Tariffs only ever helped as a stop gap for protectionistic industrial sectors."
436,Tariff may not be a good thing but it WORKS AND WORKS VERY WELL AND EFFECTIVE.
437,"Should tariffs be imposed by the EU, Canada and China on US goods to balance out the US imposed tariffs?"
438,You can’t grow bananas in Minnesota.
439,People should read von Mises more
440,"I laugh at the lack of critical thinking in society these days.  You can talk about complicated economic policy all day, but the elephant in the room is that the US consumer is the number one consumer on Earth.  If foreign companies have a large percentage of their revenue come from US consumer markets, and their product or service is not a necessity, they could be in big trouble.  Never underestimate your customer base and their ability to prioritize their needs."
441,I don’t think people realize how powerful the US is. This won’t last long.
442,"Im definitely not smarter than alot of these people, but as an everyday individual, its pretty obvious to me that companies that are slapped with a 25% hit to their margin, will increase prices by 25% as a base. Might as well tack on another 5% for extra profits. The world also mostly works with monopolies, so the competition is already dead. We will take on these tariffs."
443,Tldr: Drumf is just here to fill up the tank and cash out in 4 years.
444,Seeing AI generated videos and images interspersed with actual stock footage is unsettling.
445,Ya that graph at 3:16 paired with that explanation could get you sent too a prison. It does not do that. That is insanity.
446,"I don't think the argument of ""we need to exploit overseas slave labor and poor working conditions so we can have cheap stuff"" is a good one, personally."
447,"A few seconds into the video already gives the answer: tariffs are a policy heavily used by Brazil, this will go wrong for the group that really matters - the population.
Hope you guys don't need to pay for decades long policy to ""protect the infant industry"" like we do, spending more money for worse products and bootlegs of foreign goods."
448,"Guys, u dont understand basic. Good will be cost 25% more, but this 25% of price goes to government budget! This is main reason.  Its working as tax for all non domestic goods, parts, and materials."
449,"I don't think I have anything American made in my house, maybe some parts that were necessary for construction but even then"
450,"Inspired by the 19th century

451,"WTH difference does it make WHERE you pay the tax?   The point is that we will be paying more taxes, a LOT more, called instead, tariffs.  The selling country doesn't pay the tariffs, WE DO, as importers and consumers.  I had a couple  of expensive items I was going to buy that are now under tariffs.   Guess what, I won't be buying them, there, or here, until these farking tariffs disappear."
452,Can we please elect you to manage all this?
453,"Americans want to ""buy in America"" until they have to buy in America."
454,"Yes, saved you 16 minutes."
455,Tariffing Canada is like tariffing Michigan.  Same effect.
456,"But guess what, they worked"
457,"The graph you had about tariffs throughout the last 200 years shows an instant huge dip after each spike. This means it did work, for a very short time, resulting in prices of things just sky rocketing. Tariffs DO NOT WORK! it's a selfish way. It creates a constant rise in prices..."
458,"Were you being serious when you said that the market for American pickup trucks is not as competitive or innovative as it should be?  I have to assume that this perspective is because you are on the outside looking in, with your own biases looking at it through a lens colored by your own domestic market.  

Our domestic pickup truck market is fiercely competitive and when left alone it innovates to give our consumers what they want.  It is usually government intervention that causes it to ""innovate"" in ways that the market does not want, such as the recent regulatory push for EV pickups."
459,wasnt aware he planned to go 25% tariffs all around ... i don't think it is a good idea to go so high .. MAYBE 5 or 10% .. but not 25%
460,"So, Tariffs in today's economy translate to wealth redistribution from consumers to the federal government. Got it. 
I'm sure lowering the corporate tax rate again will also help families put food on the table..."
461,"Not the cherry-picked washing machine data again.  I am slow, but I am learning about biases in studying small samples.  Prices went up, started retreating down, and then COVID."
462,"If wages have stagnated, then why is domestic labor so expensive?"
463,"interesting, for a govt that claims it works based on 'commonsense', tarrifs increasing jobs is'nt really commonsense..it is much more nuanced..But you get what you voted for, enjoy the high costs"
464,"Tariffs are tax’s. 

Taxation is theft.

Hope this helps "
465,Americans are going to love paying higher prices for everything. Even after you take the tariffs away. There is no incentives to drop the prices again.
466,"I think the tariffs are great, they will greatly accelerate the ongoing fall of the US global hegemony."
467,Tariffs work at making consumers broke. There goes the consumer spending sector of the economy.
468,"Lets say tariffs do their job and companies will look to manufacture more in the US. With what labour? There is already a labour shortage in many ideas, many people are looking to leave, others are being removed."
469,"I don't think he's really going to do most of these Tariffs..  
He's just forcing people to the negotiating table from a place of leverage...  
If they don't give in to what he wants, then those Tariff threats will actually carry forward."
470,Why can’t we get this type of information from news organizations 🥹
471,"I think this video misses the point. It focuses on how tarriffs affect one industry, not a blanket application to a nation."
472,"Mexico buys a lot from the US. Steel for example. At least 45% of the steel used in cars assembled in Mexico is American. Auto parts, too, at least 50% of the parts of assembled cars in Mexico are manufactured in the US. The relationship is not the same as China."
473,"Tarrifs explained plain and simple
China sells lets say Tshirt to America for 10 dollars. 
America buys it for 10 dollars, sells it for 15 dollars 
America imposes 25% tax.
Now Tshirt costs 12.5 dollars to get from China
America buys it for 12.5 dollars and sells it for 17.5
China doesnt lose money at this point, its American consumers that losing the money."
474,In the end its a matter of if the American people are willing to suffer short term for long term benefit

484,The issue with the USA is greed.. companies are greedy. They want to make money at all cost.
485,"It's hard to find a single case in history where tariffs worked. It was tried many times in USA by other presidents, but always let to economic downfall. So either people can believe, that one person somehow will make things work which never worked  before, or that his goal is different. It can't be proven, but during crisis rich people get richer, average and poor become more poor. While Trump and his friends as true businessman profit, poor people cheer for him, because he ""made america look strong""."

494,"US could only tax the land and nothing else. It would be 6-7 cents per square meter per year, and they would have the same 6trillion$ budget.
Seems fair to me, you would be taxing the land since private property forbids anybody else to use it."
495,"I don't think people realize that most working class people in the US live paycheck to paycheck. This is very bad and very unstable. 

Asking poor people to tighten their belts for the coming storm that wont bother you at all is absolutely insane. 

Whats even more insane is the number of poor people who have actually been gaslit into supporting this catastrophe. 

The next couple years will open some eyes once and for all. Silver lining."
496,"Tariffs kept automotive ""jobs"" in the States. I could introduce you to a few hundred American auto workers pulling underpaid non-union 66 hr weeks today. But hey, they're ""employed"", right?"
497,"Taxing Canadians and Mexicans though is a stupid idea, especially 25%, if i was Canadian i would drive to the US, buy a shed load of iphones and sneakily get them back to Canada, loads of money to be made..."
498,"Tariffs = money to government 
Least efficient entity=governments n monopolies 
Who pays the tariffs = consumers in this case low n mid income households 
Who loses= companies that now have more red tape people who pay
Outcome= inflation poor poorer mid class worse off drug cartels happy- sales increase cause population can’t cope n do more drugs and cartels  do not pay tariffs"
499,"People seem to be missing the goal here. 
The tariffs are NOT THE END GOAL HERE Tariffs are a tool to force other governments to work on solutions to problems (like drugs) and change things up. 
Yesterday, tariffs on Canada and Mexico were halted because they stayed doing something about the border"
500,The people watching this arent the people who need to watch this.
501,the answer: yes
502,"I know the channel is about econimics but as a European I cannot help but worry about how Trump phrased it, like it's our fault for not buying stuff we don't need."
503,Short answer. No. They never worked
504,"1.6 million views, 40k likes... Yeah, that tells you how people feel about tariffs."
505,"If the forecast over 50% of jobs will be replaced either by AI, automation or a combination of both, which means income tax will drop by 50% and welfare payment will increase."
506,"The former chmn. of the Council on Econ. Advisers says tariffs will add 80-cents ($0.80) to a tank full of gas for your car. I'm willing that pay that to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl which is killing 100,000 of our teenagers and young people EVERY YEAR!"
507,"While you are all distracted with tariff bluffs, your rights are going bye bye.  Do not be distracted from the attack on every citizen."
508,Tariffs is the bulwark of mercantilism. It makes people poorer.
509,They did.
510,"Smoot Hawley act... oh, it had an effect all right"
511,They should lower taxes for companies who leave and tax companies who leave
512,"I don’t think tariffs can work well in the USA, because it will increase costs on the citizenry; tariffs would make sense if they were to lower taxes."
513,That’s why we don’t have better midsize trucks?  - I just want an aussie diesel ranger/colorado
514,🇧🇷 XAI308K going to hit record highs as soon as the presale is over. US investors rush to get into XAI308K.
515,"In a bottle, yes tariffs are bad for consumers. But please don't forget the opposite of tariffs: subsidies. I think the idea of today's tariffs, is to counteract the subsidies policy of China. Remember, companies in China are partially owned by the state. This onto itself is unfair competition. If you include the fact that a lot of companies are also getting subsidies from the state(for example the car industry in China gets advantageous energy prices, in comparison with other industries in China), you can see why tariffs could be a good idea to level the play field, to be able to compete. So yeah, in a 100% fair economy, tariffs are a bad thing. But we are not living in a fair world economy, are we?"
516,I like how suddenly everyone wants to talk about tariffs like we haven't always had them. Obama and Biden had tariffs. None of this is anything new.
517,In order to protect domestic industries those industries have to actually exist
518,I think these tariffs are to make American manufacturers stronger but not in a good way. They will only get stronger bc the foreign competition was removed not bc they got better.
519,"Tariffs can work great, when you target products you can source elsewhere, like canada is doing. They way umber grimace is doing things, he thinks he can make every country his enemy and still thrive. The problem is they didnt leave a better option to source things like lumber, and america can only meet about half its own needs, and that imdustry is heavily staffed by immigrants that he is chasing away, so how is that supposed to work?"
520,They are bad when inflation is already high!
521,Empires will be needed again.  Old colonies will not be developed and secured as before but “partnerships” will look more inhuman than our current situation. No money? No problem we have forced labor.
522,Looking forward paying $60k for a base model toyota corolla.
523,Let's all trust a guy who bankrupted a casino twice.  And was allowed to fail upwards because of his father's huge safety net.  Long point short.  Most tariffs will have a negative impact on the US consumer.
524,They already did!
525,You also neglected to mention the pollution and slave labor of a lot of these foreign companies.

530,"Idk I work for a European food distributor, it’s going to be good for us in Canada"
531,US governors should retake Economics 101
532,"While there are certain things I may agree with Trump on, tariffs on everyone is not one of them. They will take years to work, if they do at all, and will cause too much economic pain in the interim on lower income people."
533,"Without watching the video, yes, tariffs work. They’ve worked throughout American history, especially in our early years. Next question."
534,He called the wrench a spanner ;)
535,We are now a few months away from XAI308K launching - Elon Musk said the presale is over soon!! Get in while you can
536,Most people criticising Trump's use of tariffs don't even seem to know that the dems kept the majority of his tariffs in place.
537,"You have put an American flag on a Danish ship in the thumbnail. Kinda ironic, if Maersk stopped docking in the US they would really feel it. And it’s not far out of the realms of possibility if Trump doesn’t back off from Greenland."
538,"Depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. Pissing off the entire world and tanking your own economy, then, yes they work great!"
539,"No need to worry about consumers, just protect the domestic business conglomerates and further push the US into a true plutocracy."
540,Can someone explain this to me in Minecraft terms
541,"It's one thing to levy tarrifs on the likes of China, large countries with cheap manufacturing... It's another to use the US's size to bully smaller allies (who are already struggling FAR more than the US is atm) with tariffs.
The political and social fallout will be severe and long-lasting."
542,"I think everyone will just take on loans at decades high interest rates and rapidly start business to fulfill missing gaps, working for $5/h to keep price low"
543,"The short-term issues with the tariffs are apparent; but the overarching problem here is that the US economy consistently operates at a massive deficit. Our prosperity is fake.

The only reason the us economy hasn't collapsed yet is because the USD is the world reserve currency (which is presently the case for a whole other list of reasons); effectively meaning the negative impacts of US economic policy are being distributed across most of the worlds population, rather than the US exclusively.

You might be able to argue that this status quo is preferable; but the reality is that the rest of the world will only tolerate so much more of this until they decide to leverage something else, like the Chinese Yuan, as the de facto reserve currency; at which point, it's game over.

The reality is that Americans are too comfortable and do not produce anywhere near enough value to afford their lifestyles; and Trump's tariffs appear to be the softest way to incentivize americans to take on risk and produce value; even if they do have a suite of temporal negative effects"
544,Tariffs only work when you pair it with regulation mandating production of goods domestically. Japan does a lot of this
545,"The best way to bring more jobs to the USA is to bring more factories to US, and tariffs is no longer the right way for to do that. 

The best way is cut of the taxes to the companies, many companies will transfer their production to the USA, the right is it be zero taxes to the companies, it will force a good competition between countries to attract the companies, if cut the taxes to the companies it means the products will be cheaper, and the people will get a good benefit from that competition. 

This is basic, however, government just ignore that fact. 

Another thing is, cut of the federal income tax or it should be a little just to self defense only, as Israel does, the cost to be the cops on the world is to high for us US citizen, and today no-one wants to be those sponsors anymore."
546,The tariffs will definitely work to hurt the poor and middle class.
547,"Tariffs are a weapon and a means to a solution but no one is realizing this they just worry about their wallet. We have two nations that within 24 hours not even that with Mexico. Gave in to our demands and have already captured and started working at doing what it is they promised. It’s not a goal it’s a means to an end. Mexico took about 130 kilogrammes, or 286 pounds of fentanyl down the other day. Largest amount ever captured in Mexico history. They are doing work and all it took was one word."
548,"i am pretty sure that question was asked around 7 years ago, and the answer is gave 7 years later and it is; no, it doesn't work."
549,"If you want to ruin your own industry, yes."
550,"The biggest issue with the Trump tariffs, specifically, is that he doesn’t seem to understand what they’re for. His blanket “tariffs on everything” policy will be an economic disaster."
551,"The US has to choose between Financial Capitalism and Industrial Capitalism. One cancels the other, so we cannot do both!"
552,The abbreviation for billion is B.
553,"Looking purely at the economics while ignoring the politics somewhat misses the point. 

The tarrifs are blanket in some ways, but targeted in others. They aim not to improve the US economy, but rather to harm the Chinese economy. It's a political play, not an economic one. The ultimatums given to border states show this."
554,"I didn't vote for him, but the idea of tariffs didn't turn me off aside from the obvious hypocrisy of basing a campaign on complaining about higher prices while also championing an economic strategy that would further raise prices. I mean, tariffs, done right, could actually help the country in the long run.

However, the way he has gone about it has all the trappings of the exact wrong way to approach it. The problems aren't Mexico and Canada, they are China, the other Asian tigers, and the EU. If anything, Canada and Mexico are in a similar position to us. We could be partnering with them to achieve our goals, but instead we deeply antagonize them for so little gain."
555,you speak fast and swallow some words. hard to follow without subtitles
556,The fact that nobody sees this as a negotiation tool is hilarious. It's a salesman's tactic to get things at the price he wants. If people voted for him for how much better he had the economy let him do his job. The man is literally a business man that's what he specializes in. He negotiated himself to president he negotiated himself to a billionaire negotiated himself out of court cases I believe I would let him do the negotiations especially if you're not a billionaire or a business person I'm telling you if nothing else I can tell you he's got this part of it in the bag.
557,"Mexico just caved and will send 10,000 troops to the border with the U.S. THIS IS THE POWER TRUMP WIELDS WITH THE THREAT OF TARIFFS!"

561,"Companies will use this as a means to price gouge, even if they only last a few weeks. Wait until Tim and Cindy from Indiana who voted MAGA find out how much we depend on Can/Mex for food."
562,So why is it OK for other countries to tariff the US but it is not all right for the US to tariff other countries?
563,"The Billionaires will get a windfall as they increase prices 20% or more.
This will take America into a depression deeper than they caused last time they did this."
564,We should avoid tariffs on raw/refined materials
565,How about we just shrink big government spending instead of trying different ways to raise the money for corrupt government?
566,"If Tariffs only hurt the domestic economy, why has mexico and canada been tariffing us HUNDREDS of percentage points on products? Tariffs are good for thee, but not for me?

Other countries have been taking advantage of the US for DECADES. And the US has just taken it while our domestic manufacturing has been gutted and lives destroyed with fentanyl. NO MORE. BRING ON THE TARIFFS."
567,"Tariffs won't increase wages, so let capitalism destory itself."
568,but but but............he's playing 4D chess! You don't understand! lol!
569,Sure they'll work. They will work in making everything much much more expensive.
570,"The most important parts of the argument is missed:
1) Who does the ""counting""? We are also told that the US has the worst neonatal care in the western world. However, if one looks to see HOW baby deaths are counted, then you will see the US has the HIGHEST care. France. for instance, doesn't count any baby that is thought to have no chance of survival while the US counts EVERY baby regardless. The Friedman side is basically hoisted by their own petard. Tariffs and their effects are too complex to actually know exactly what the effects are. They are just estimations.
2) The poker problem. If you do not think tariffs have their place, then you must think you can play poker against a billionaire when you are just a normal person without betting limits. The US can't not compete against a world that has as much slavery as it does. And make no mistake about it. China uses slave labor.

I could go on, but why? If economic ideas would work, then this country wouldn't have been hollowed out by NAFTA."
571,I think  president should complete a 1 year economic certification before Running
572,"If I watch this video and the creator isn’t familiar with the Austrian school, imma be sad."
573,"why is this #36 trending and not #1, our priorities are all wrong."
574,Dramatic Tariffs threats in todays complex international trades are unwise. More damage than good and domestic consumers pay the price.
575,Sorry have to dislike for use of AI photos at 9:05
576,"The US has been on a slow march towards deglobalization for a long time. Or perhaps more clearly stated, the US has been pushing towards self-sufficient production, and keeping as much as possible to be an exporter. Food, energy, military, and tech has been the focus since the 90s. And now the focus is moving towards manufacturing.
And this isn't something new. It started with the new nafta treaties in 2018, trying to move manufacturing ""close to home"" even if ""at home"" didn't seem practical... But manufacturing didn't move much, as it was still cheaper to manufacture in Asia, and import to the US directly. It wasn't until the first set of terrifs and the pandemic's interruption of supply chains that traction started happening. And then Biden doubled down on many of the same policies, and actually enforced the policies put forward by trump that ended up being easy to skirt around. And now trump seems to be tripping down on it all.

The things to watch that is taking people by surprise are
1) it is no longer just cheap Asian imports being targeted. The scope has broadened to practically all imported goods, even from allies and partner countries with long standing beneficial relationships. And nobody really saw that coming.
2) that the focus is no longer around bringing manufacturing purely to north America to keep prices low importing from Canada and Mexico which seemed to be the plan with Trump 1.0 and Biden. Now the rhetoric is that Canada and Mexico should seek statehood if they want nafta-like treatment... Which would make Republicans never re-electable ever again, which is why I think it is rhetorical and not an honest suggestion.

The thing is... This is already the direction things were moving. Just much more aggressively than anyone's wildest expectations. It takes time to build a manufacturing base, and it was actively being worked on, so the rush and change of the goal posts seem a little bit crazy.
I think the other effect is just how much this will cause disruptions to manufacturing and supply side inflation in the short run. As well as manufacturer side inflation building out the infrastructure and hiring needed to make this practical. Until the transition completes, we will likely see 5-10% inflation be normal before things settle down... And that could be a decade or two, which would be rough.
I suspect that the thinking is that we have the lead on AI and robotics, which will allow a sort of jobless manufacturing revolution. If that proves out, then inflation effects could be greatly minimized by the deflationary effects of automation... But as someone to follows those fields quite a bit, I don't think we are there yet at a practical level. Great strides have been made, and it is coming in the next decade... But pushing this hard this fast is taking too much AI PR hype at face value and not understanding how immature the tech is right now. It will get there... But still 3-5 years before any real reliable deployment is ready with expected costs and procedures that can last more than a couple years before being redone. And doing double-work at that scale is expensive and inflationary, not cost savings and deflationary like tech often is.

Next 4 years are going to be weird... I don't know. The world lost its mind, and we are all turning into Russia now. And I'm pretty sure that Russia is the first to say that they don't want to be Russia, so I'm not sure what the game plan and motive is. "
577,Too bad that the current US President has the attention span of a three-year old and is not capable of watching a 16 minute video...
578,It's on the premise that other countries will give in and bow to Trump in return. He never meant to actually enforce the tariff.
579,"It's a national security issue, so simple economic calculus does not apply."
580,A sneaky way to tax the consumer? It's not sneaky at all lol.
581,"At minimum, there needs to be domestically manufactured (no tariff) product options for American consumers for Trump's insane ""strategy"" to even have a remote chance of succeeding.  In reality, most of the products Americans buy today (or the components that go inside them) are NOT MADE in the US.  It would take 5-10 years; a lot of private and government investment; and lower cost labor (more legal immigration) to reverse the trend that drove the production of consumer products to China and Mexico in the late 90s and early 00s."
582,"Very disappointed that this video is simply a more detailed version of a first-order analysis on tariffs.  You can't talk about tariffs in an economic vacuum without considering currency devaluations when tariffs are imposed, the level of government subsidies foreign goods may receive, and the usage of tariffs as a negotiating tactic to achieve geopolitical goals (i.e., with Mexico and Canada).  Any analysis that doesn't include political impacts as relates to foreign policy is misleading to viewers."
583,Some of these countries will send us blueberries that don't taste like blueberries. Enjoy your blueberries and other bad produce. WE'RE GOOD!
584,At least we're getting to buy XAI308K early before the general public hears it. Enjoy your millions 
585,"Step two: No tariffs, just kidding with step one."
586,“Donald Trump is pushing a plan to explicitly use revenue from higher tariffs on imported goods to help pay for extending billionaires tax cuts” - Reuters  It is all bout the money  for billionaires.
587,"Just to get this straight, when a political hopeful; Kamala Harris says she wants to raise taxes on American corporations. Thats not a bad thing, it doesn’t increase costs right? 

When another politician puts what is basically a tax on foreign companies, we all totally understand how to impacts prices, since those corporations just pass along the added cost of the tariff (tax). 

Is everyone this stupid?"
588,Fun Fact: Rarely impacts the rich! Definitely impacts the average people.
589,Even if useful... a sudden shock instead of gradually.. will not have the desired effect.
590,Man the Canadians are throwing a hissy fit 
591,"""Where tariffs will be placed on things that never were and never can be made in the domestic economy.""
What a back asswards concept.   The point of tariffs is to encourage domestic manufacturing, not make more expensive things that never were and never can be made in the domestic economy. That's just ridiculous.  Tariff laws must include a clause that loophole avoidance (such as the flat pack example in the video) should be penalized appropriately."
592,"I think many people are making the mistake of taking Trump/Musk at face value. It's definitely a mistake to think either of them is stupid and doesn't know how damaging things like blanket tariffs can be. It's Trump's version of ""gunboat diplomacy,"" where he gets what he really wants because everyone knows he is prepared to take action that everyone else would think insane. Getting Panama to leave the Chinese Belt and Road scheme being a good example."
593,"They voted for Trump because they were mad about high prices… So he goes and does something that all but guarantees prices will get even higher, and they cheer him on. Make it make sense ️"
594,I would be ok with tariffs if it can replace govt income and end income tax.
595,Maybe tarifs ilustrate the paradox of thrift
596,If tariff raises prices of goods because of the companies being tax more so does  taxing the rich wouldn't that also raise the prices because the rich pass the tax to the consumer's they are doing the same thing
597,"Can Tariffs work as a Boycott? Price goes up to buy from Said country, So American companies buy from other country.... defacto enforcing a boycott"
598,"I'm not a democrat, not even murrican, but republicans have stated in the topic of small government, but they always make it bigger."
599,"This all assumes corporations would act in good faith instead of going to other countries, putting the cost increase on consumers, or using work arounds to not pay the tariffs… But they NEVER will because they’re psychopathic monsters of greed… This video trying to be impartial is even acting on bad faith, even humoring like corporations won’t take advantage of everyone to make just a dollar more profit… ️"
600,"No. They don't work lol.

Love how us gives 25% to friends and 10% to enemies"
601,"The problem is there isn’t current movement back to the US besides the fear of the tariffs.
There is no reason to move to the US where the regulation on your business is so much higher.
China has us beat at grunt labor. I don’t think we can beat their sweatshop wages.
The idea was americans would get smarter and we would just do all the innovating and let the other countries do the work; however, a lot of dumb people here still need careers and so we need a certain amount of industry.
We only need a bit more and i believe our problems could be solved by by cutting regulations not by blanket tariffs.
I believe we actually don’t want to be the industrial powerhouse when we are and could remain the innovation powerhouse.
There are many other problems trump should focus on before this."
602,"I think this review is heavily biased. You are evaluating short term impact as if that is a valid measure of the tariff's effectiveness. The ""rust belt"" didn't form overnight, and it won't be rebuilt overnight."
603,How is tariff s eethnicnationalism??
604,Got in early because XAI308K is already predicted to pass $2 by June.
605,Why did you completely skip tariffs in the 1930s and how they made the Great Depression worse?
606,Alexander Hamilton of Broadway fame... really? 
607,Everyone is an economist in the comments 
608,"""Europe doesn't want our cars"" builds shitty cars and adds Tarrifs"
609,Murricans forgot the power of the dollar risides that it buys worth from goods and services from a piece a paper that worth nothing.
610,"I know they can target individual products. But can they target individual states and even individual companies? If so, impose heavy tariffs only on those products from deeply red states!"
611,"The depths of intention lying in this video is amazing but this entire argument agaisnt tarrifs boils down to one single thing it doesn't matter if a product is a dollar or a million dollars if you have no job you can't afford it. It doesn't matter if chinese goods are 99% cheaper than American made goods, if as in American you make no income due to that job being shipped overseas you can't afford either. It's pure ignorance to be agaisnt tarrifs"
612,"Can tariffs actually work? Yes, they can.
Will they work? Quite unlikely."
613,5:27 so what you're saying is.... The civil war wasn't JUST about slavery. Funny how that turned out when you're trying to argue against tariffs 
614,At least normal american can change from saying “they need to work two jobs to live” to “they need to work three to four jobs to live”. And trump and elon musk gets richer because tesla can jack up the price and still cheaper than imported cars. They can make another meme coin if they need a new gold plated toilet
615,Trumps plans are always based on him looking tough at the expense of sense.
616,Nice job 
617,Did Elon Musk just abandon Doge coin and make his own XAI308K coin? WOW this guys a genius lol
618,Last Trump term . . . When did a 20% tariff on imported steel . . . Domestic steel producers raised prices by 20% to match.  Domestic production learns profits come from federal government intervention . . . Not in innovation and efficiency and quality and customer care.
619,Trump's First 48 Hours and XAI308K coin is already BOOMING. 
620,No mention of time frame. 2 or 3 years is all that is needed till the next election.
621,Let's wait and see what Americans will call Trump at the end of his presidency: a superhero or a traitor
622,"Just look at the last tariffs Trump started. Solar panel production has not returned. Metal tariffs did curtail chinese steel dumping that did drive china to more easily close some over production. However alu production did not return and did more plants get built in the US when china holds much of the raw material supply. Trump has tariffed  everything, low value stuff as well as high value items that just might have been brought back"
623,Tarrifs can work if he abolishes the income taxes and regulations.
624,Greed ruins all
625,Yes
626,"As always, the US does not have an income problem. It has a spending problem."
627,"Man, I agree with Trump and Trumpers.  It is about time we showed the world what we can do.   No components,  none should be from a non-domestic source.  Every component, every single screw, every chip, everything, should be from the US.   Not only that, but all labor should be from the US - none of this near-shore, off-shore nonsense.  I mean everything, including all the raw materials, the silicon, the iron, the plastics, mined, refined by US companies.   The bulldozer used to get the raw materials?  Only use 100% US machinery.  Only US mines and domestic sources.  If the materials, machinery, or skills don't exist?  Then screw it, we will do without.  The Amish live just fine and so will we."
628,Yes.
629,"Do Americans really want to be taking factory jobs off the Chinese, though? Given the increasing risk of automation in many of these jobs (which is only amplified in higher wage countries), this just seems like going backwards..."
630,It's a shame that the people who need to understand this video are too dumb to understand it.
631,Nope. No logic in taxes. Except thieves logic.
632,"Oh, boy. This is going to be a hard sell to my fellow Americans. We are so used to cheap goods from the likes of Temu and even Amazon that having to pay extra for stuff will be a mountain from that oh-so-little molehill. Between tariffs and eliminating 'de minimis', it is time to see what Americans are made of..."
633,No.  They can’t.  Just hurts Americans.
634,This is Budweiser's chance to take the lead again as America's #1 beer again! Stop buying Mexican beer people!
635,"Now that Trump has signed in his tariffs, this video needs an update."
636,"Stop buying stuff yearly even though the market tells you too. Buy american or local anytime you can and you are better than most people in the US. 

Voting with your wallet isnt a joke. Do your part!"
637,This is just blatant low IQ slop. The national benefit of protecting and fostering domestic manufacturing is leagues more important than relative price hikes.
638,The answer is no and here’s why. Trump is not bases on some thing from the past. He also does not care about any economic problems they’re facing the general population he only cares about his rich buddies. That’s the truth until everyone realizes that they will continue this pointless arguing.
639,This aged like milk in less than 48 hours that's a new record
640,We have no other choice. Withiut tariffs nothing will change
641,Who pays for a 25% tariff on potash?

The rest of the world is talking about an unstable psychopath in charge of economic policy."
645,They’ve already worked Mexico is going to enforce their laws on their citizens and keep them out of our country

647,Time to drive American industry!
648,goods are not cheap nowadays at all
649,Yes.
650,Better tariffs than income tax. Tariffs aren’t progressive so lower income people have to pay a fair share.
651,"itd funny he claims he wants to ""lower taxes"" when tariffs are just a tax lol"
652,"Americans: things are expensive. 
Trump: hold my beer."
653,Doing it all that too improving the countries economy and then spending it all for military and to Israel

672,"No it wont work. It would only work if you wanted to protect your local production from a much more industrialized, much more powerful economy"
673,"No, tariffs are inherently EVIL."
674,"Please explain at 14:40 https://youtu.be/K0V8kZyl1T0?si=jntaNOAx-9N9KiBJ&t=881

Why should tarrifs be placed on things (from all countries) that is not produced domestically nor will ever be produced domestically (in a rich western country)?
Considering only national security and business, disregarding ethical concerns.

I just see stifling of innovation with this with terrible economic loss. (along with an infinite other downsides)



Thanks for one of your most interesting video to date, and perhaps most complicated to understand.. ;)"

689,"Tariff's will not work, American labor is too expensive, the cost of living is too high for Americans to accept low paying jobs (especially if he guts all social safety nets), it also takes years to close and build new factories and then they would have to find a US source for certain materials which the US may not even have"
690,"I understand that this video is not entirely about this but is it at all possible that if trump were to put tarrifs on all imported goods and do away with income tax entirely that the two could cancel each other out? The individual products you purchase would cost more but you would be saving a lot of money by not having to pay income tax. As for a business owners perspective, I actually own a small construction company and pay around 30% on income tax, If I have to pay 25% more on materials but not pay income taxes I'm still up 5% on my net profit. I completely understand that a nations economy is a fickle thing and every change in policy can have unexpected results, but I believe that if it were done carefully, it could be done. I realize that there are and always will be companies that will use any chance they get to, lets be honest price gouge, but my customers can only afford to pay me so much for my services. So at least for myself in the above scenario I would lower my labor rate and pass the increased cost of goods onto the customer saving us both a little money and being able to outbid my more greedy compition on contracts. As for my now untaxed pay check, the amount would be a little higher, but all products would cost more, however I would essentially be ""paying taxes"" on only the products and services I actually use, making it easier to save money in the long run right?"
691,"Seeing how the peso is down against the USD by 20% year over year and the Canadian dollar is down about 10%, tariffs are a logical step to balance the devaluation of their currencies. Fast forward a day or two, and Mexico and Columbia agreed to meet the terms to avoid tariffs anyway."
692,It can work if you don't get abusive with them. But its not the tariffs im concerned about. Its the danger as warmonger trump wants to invade his own allies.
693,This is SO BORING to watch.. and the information isn't worth it.
694,He's forgetting we taxed the top 10% wealthy
695,Its worth it
696,There's a reason Trumps businesses have all failed.
697,So tariffs increases product prices
698,You skipped the Gilded Age in the 1890s through to the Crash in 1929: the closest approximation in the past of MAGA institutional corruption . Tarifs played a key role in triggering the Great Depression. How convenient of you to overlook that.

703,"Great content, but when talking about Trump's tariffs, IMHO it misses an important nuance.  Trump seems to often use them as bargaining tools.  See Canada and Mexico's response to his threat as a perfect example."

I looked at some goods we use where prices have doubled in the last 8 years...has our pay doubled?  no... this will make it even worse.  maybe save a few bucks from lower taxes but then prices you have to spend even more than you save...not going to work.  if Trump sees this as us forcing us to make more goods here etc. sure, but guess what.  the cost here is a lot more than 10% or 25% so these tariffs just increase prices and do little to increase production in the USA."

715,"why the option to charge more taxes to the rich i never in the table, in china the rich pay 40% taxes Denmark, 67% taxes, USA 1% , the taboo about the open market is over, so why dont borke another taboo and increase the taxes to the rich."

746,"Its just possible the blanket ban shoes trump which tariffs to drop later. What price increases vs domestic manufacting at home hits his voters the most. What gets reported on fox news and can producers and retailers just say its tariffs without tariffs ever having that impact on them like the dryers.
In an ideal plan, you'd tariff high value imports like cars in mexico and Canada or expensive electronics (robots, precision engineering, dumped goods looking for any market sales even at a loss). He'd tariff chips but he need Taiwan and the chip act needs time and the intel saga to work out. 
The good news is that all those markets taiffed will look to export away from the US"
747,"Written by someone who clearly only thinks short term and is unable to fully comprehend the entirety of the tarrif system.
I would like anyone who thinks a tarrif based system cannot work to do something.  Go look at your last pay stub.  Look at exactly how much you lose to taxes and figure out exactly how much you would gain in a year if you didn't have to pay it.  Then add on your fees, if any, to file those taxes.
Now, with this number in mind, would you have more or less money per year if the prices of every day goods rose by 10%, which would be more than expected?
For most Americans, that is going to be a massive increase in savings, if they manage it properly.  After a few years, the market will adjust, raising employment costs or lowering everything from employment costs and prices.  In the end, when you see a job advertising XX per year, that is actually what it pays instead of half that.  People will be more capable of living within their means instead of relying on credit.
Tarrifs simplify so much if it were to replace income tax.  The world is complicated enough and moving so fast that most cannot keep up, even if they won't admit it.  Tarrifs will help overall.  The only people it would actually hurt are the super wealthy, which doesn't actually hurt them, or those who are unwilling to manage money properly, which they do to themselves."

792,No. I saved you 15 mins & 55 seconds.
793,Answer: No
794,Let me sum this up: no.
795,"The problem with these tarifs is that will hurt the consumers’s economy. The local products will not lower its prices. In practice, the local products will get pricy cuz u dont produc every raw material in your country."
796,No.  No they won't
797,there is NOTHING good about tariffs
798,But hey Trump can just release a new coin  pump that sht and sell everything
799,Spoiler: no
800,Two words:  Smoot Hawley
801,"TLDR: Tariffs can be beneficial to the country, especially to promote (protect) domestic markets. In today's world they don't work because you can't enforce a law with countless loopholes, causing issues domestically and internationally"

810,Cut the power
811,No. Next question.
812,I wonder who funds this channel
813,"""CHINA, CHINA, CHINA"""
814,"Sorry, but not agree."
815,Lets just say it.  Tariffs are a priori destructive.  No cases exist where they are economically beneficial because they eliminate competition and force consumers to buy goods they didnt want to voluntarily buy in the first place.  Tariffs raise prices and lower quality simultaneously while also picking individual winner and loser goods in the market.  Its honestly hard to think of a tax method that is more destructive and distorts the market forces more unfairly than tariffs.
816,"In short, no."
817,No
818,I hope more republicans find this video.
819,no
820,"Think the point is that the American Economy is strong enough to handle price increases right now if it means that geo-political missions are accomplished. China, Mexico and Canada can only hold on for so long without American's buying their exports. At some point they'll have to cave and give in to what the Americans want. Which I believe is for those countries to do a better job of policing their borders and drug traffickers. In my opinion, it's worth it."
821,SLOW DOWN!!
822,"Brazilian here: tariffs don't work, all they do is make the domestic industry behind in relation to other countries in the world, because without external competition and with protectionism industries produce worse and more expensive products for consumers, not to mention the corruption generated in the bureaucratic import process and greater state intervention in the economy which leads to economic estagnation. ask me how I know this."
823,NO!!!!!!
824,"Key takeaways:
1. Tariffs are paid by the importer and passed on to the consumer, but Trump has convinced MAGA that Mexico and China will pay for the tariffs.
2. Even if inflation worsens, MAGA will blame Democrats instead of looking into the mirror.
3. Expect dramatic increases in export from countries like Vietnam due to Chinese exports flowing through there.
4. Tariffs won't create factories in America out of thin air, the most likely outcome is importing everything from the next cheapest country. 
5. Even with tariffs in place, most goods made in Mexico and China will still be way cheaper than those made in the U.S"

853,I got a dislike your video for the built-in ads.
854,"Tariffs has been, historically speaking, pretty effective. 

At degrading the american economy that is."
855,"Too bad the Vlogger had to get into an anti-Trump screed. Tariffs never caused a single price increase, the increase of appliance prices were complex and varied. And it was never explained how tariffs are actually levied, which is on a first purchase price... he doesn't go into the supply chain, full of middle men, where the real price increases happen. This guy usually does a pretty good job, too bad he merely aggregated the establishment view and really didn't drill down into the mechanism of tariffs."
856,MAGA fell for it again
857,Tarrif is just a way of squeezing more money from people
858,History shows the answer is no. Look up how tariffs worked during the depression.
859,Correct me if I’m wrong but tarifa worked back than because of slavery
860,"History shows that In the 1930s we had the great depression and how did that come about, Have the Americans learnt nothing. Mmmmmuppets!!"
861,Too bad DEI has made it so Gen Z refuse to work hard factory jobs in order to bring manufacturing back to the US.
862,The whole idea is to get more made in the US domestically to stimulate the economy. However what happens is it just drives prices up and MORE IMPORTANTLY IT JUST SHUFFLES AROUND WHERE DOMESTIC SELLERS BUY THOSE ITEMS FROM. Tariffs are beyond dumb and if you fell for trumps idiotic plan.......Need to go back to school....
863,"This is 100% an innocent question that my fellow Americans will surely answer but... why is Trump beefing with Europe? I mean, I know there's some tension because of the war on Ukraine, especially because most european countries are slacking on their defense budgets, but why tariffs?"
864,No it didn’t work once for the USA which I think is why they changed to income taxes etc.    Laurie. NZ. 
865,you do great explainers but stop calling people mate
866,"If you do the math, 1800 jobs at 815k per job, that's 1.467 billion. Pretty darn close to the 1.5 billion. Also you have to account for the dryers cost being raised as well as the taxed washing machine. Which is a relatively unique example of price increases, that inflates that 1.5 billion. Also in your example of steel, why didn't the domestic industries like auto, just buy domestic made steel? At 9:12  shouldn't that mean more domestic steel companies start popping up to meet the demand? I'm not quite convinced by this evidence you presented."
867,Beers
868,No serious economist across the political spectrum likes tariffs. Especially as a way to generate income. Replacing income tax with tariffs is literally trying to fit  a square peg in a round hole.
869,"Rule 1: Buy American. Rule 2: If product not available, build/grow in America. Rule 3: See rule 1."
870,Tldw; no
871,"I'm in support of tariffs worldwide because we need to grow more localized industry (both for the purpose of wealth equality and climate reasons) but ironically they simply wont work in any positive manner unless you were to implement so called 'socialist' policies like taxing the 1% more (which solved the great depression) and dismantling the financial sector along with the myth of infinite growth. 

Otherwise countries like america are simply hastening their current path to mimic china more closely with a few ultra wealthy families paying slave wages to workers in unsafe conditions and hoarding the generated wealth to themselves (which is already their current situation, just not as extreme yet). Funnily enough Trump even wants to reintroduce children to factory work, just like china."

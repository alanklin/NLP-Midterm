Trump will never back down on tariffs. He promised them. Even reducing them would show immense weakness and prove that he is a liar and a con. Let's keep watching.

The world is golf-clapping at you,America. Enjoy paying more for your goods with your tariffs. Imagine, for a moment, that Canada decides to retaliate with 25% tarrif on electricity supplied to the US? That would make America great again. What happened to the Jan 6ers? Is this not worth going down to the capital for a rally?

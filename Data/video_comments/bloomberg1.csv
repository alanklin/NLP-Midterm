Since President Donald Trump first threatened to impose sweeping tariffs against China and US trading partners during his election campaign, companies and businesses have been bracing for impact. While his inaugural address stopped short of imposing tariffs on day one, Trump has issued fresh threats to Mexico, Canada and China, forcing investors and businesses to navigate an uncertai …

I retired with 26 years of tariff administration experience in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (formerly U.S. Customs Service). My job was to review/process the paperwork and collect the duties (tariffs) due on imported goods. When imported goods enter the Customs territory of the United States, duties are paid by the Importer of Record (IOR), which may be a corporation or an individual. NOTHING is paid by any foreign entity (manufacurer, shipper, or nation).

This guy is going to be the final nail in the coffin for us, fellow Americans. Whenever he forces a country to do what he says, and they refuse, he immediately bombards them with tarrifs as punishment. But in reality, the ones who will be paying for those ridiculous tarrifs are you and me. Every day, he's only making himself a target.

Looking at the US Bureau of Statistics, under the Consumer Price Index, one can notice that in the last quarter of last year, stocks are not really doing well, especially energy stocks as they seem to be below the zero point. However, I don't know if stocks will quickly rebound as I have no clue the direction of the market. Can I get an advice on any other stocks that I can acquire to diversify my reserve of $300k across multiple markets while creating a comprehensive portfolio.

The tarriff plan will evidently lead to high inflation, the high inflation is a significant reason why most retirees have sleepless nights. The increase in prices of everyday items puts them at risk of running out of money. As prices rise, the amount of money retirees can withdraw from their retirement savings also increases.

What happens if products arrive at the border in parts to be assembled in the US by a small Chinese business with mainly robots for the last 5% of the work? No tariffs and no American jobs? Or.. new jobs for all those extra civil servants (paid by the American tax payers) who will have to check all these creative ways to avoid tariffs. Trump is the best example of someone who  avoided paying taxes his whole life.  I don't think other countries can't be as creative.

It's a complex world and if the US puts tariffs like these on products, then those countries are going to route around the United States like they routed around russia. 
And then 4 years when Trump is gone, those countries supply chains won't need the United States anymore. 
It will be a painful transition, but it will be a semi-permanent transition.

Countries just shrug their shoulders at the word tariff.
They don't care because the consumer ultimately pays the tax, not the exporting company.

>The United States used to be a manufacturing country. Since the end of the Second World War this changed from a manufacturing center to a consumer center. All governments since the end of that conflict have been increasing the national debt, all of which has devalued the US dollar to the point where, today, a US dollar is worth about three cents, yes three cents, compared with a 1971 US dollar. So, today all the consuming US public is consuming with devalued dollars, hence, the increase in the sticker price of all goods and services. We simply need more of these devalued dollars to buy anything.
>The plan by the current US government to install these tariffs is a distraction from the real problem which is the US debt and the devalued US dollar. Currently, the US debt to GDP ratio is well over 100% and so the only way to get this ratio down is either to pay down the debt or to increase the productivity of the nation. The former is out of the question; the second option will take maybe twenty to thirty years. The latter is not unrealistic since it really took over forty years to create this problem in the first place. 
>With regard to the stated deficit in trade with Canada this is a complete falsehood. If one were to include services as well as goods, then the deficit would be dramatically altered. In addition, the US imports over four million barrels of oil each day. This oil is shipped at deep discounts which allows the US refineries to sell the finished product on the open market generating huge profits. The statements by the US President are misleading, incomplete and false. We are living in dangerous times. The last thing a leader ought to be doing is turning on its trusted and reliable ally. He will pay for this and so will the American people. Just wait until they go the grocery store or the gas station.
>This whole charade will not end well. Canada should immediately reform the inter-provincial trade barriers and should continue to forge new alliances around the world, including with China, India and the other BRICS nations. The US is in decline. The Americans do not appreciate what we, Canada, represent. Once the trust is broken it will never be restored. Canada should turn away from the whole misconception that the US is our friend and ally. 
It is not!

Canada has about 20% of the world's surface freshwater, but only about 7% of the world's renewable freshwater. By 2030 fresh water will be a commodity treated like gold and oil. Not to mention our minerals like Nickel, which is used in electric vehicles (EVs). It's a key component in the cathode material of lithium-ion batteries, which power EVs.... Who has a company for EVs???? ELON / Tesla!!!! Who is in bed with Trump. It is NOT about the border, and if it was, he wouldn't be joking about making us the 51st state. He WANTS OUR RESOURCES

Ever since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, companies have moved manufacturing to Mexico with the aim of exporting goods to the US. When you reimpose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, you're going to see less of that. Some companies will find it cheaper to manufacture in the US while others will find it cheaper to simply pay the tariff. Either way it lessens the loophole.

I don’t know if ppl pretend to be dumb when it comes down to Trump’s tariffs strategy or they are actually dumb, I mean you can’t see the forest for the trees, it’s not simply about making stuff more expensive but about changing the entire system on how to trade with countries getting richer and richer at the expense of the crazy consumption of USA citizens, so if things are done properly the only winner will be USA and subsequently other economies globally and moreover it plays an important role in geopolitical strength. China got so crazy rich by putting strict rules on foreign investors wanting to do business in their country for instance car manufacturers, they had to become allies with a local car manufacturer in order to produce their cars in china, now china sells more EVs than tesla, because they managed to get ahold of intel, let’s not talk about electronics or  even AI.

Like him or not Trump is based. America has gone far and beyond to provide the infrastructure for global service economies that placed the West amongst developed nations, most prominently post-WW2. But since the '70s/80s, a new economic philosophy democratised value chains through new capital markets that allowed unforeseen economies to take over all aspects of competencies gained through outsourcing. If you're short sighted you'd view it as a tax on ""you"", but the reality is Trump's saying buckle your boots we're opening up our own shop. Its ironic and scary to see because as Clinton said, ""no country can escape the global economy,"" an economy in which America is the centre. I need a popcorn bucket and bunker to last 4 years.

Stop gaslighting. You just said that when ww2 came in , US tarriffs dropped significantly.  So they were high and the US was one of the most prosperous countries on earth. Then you said ""Canada's automobile manufacturing"" ... Canada doesn't make cars. Those are American companies. So if you point or view need to lie to have a chance of making sense , drop it. Stop lying and start telling the truth.

Why do you have to make this way of propaganda ? Bloomberg has some of the most sophisticated economists in the world and they come up with this simple narrow minded report ? Educate the people instead of washing their brain and they will love you again; isolate the other narrative more and it will even gain more supporters. What a world I am living in ...

This is not completely true. American companies that are complaining about their cost of production going up were the main beneficiaries of cheap labor across the pacific. The imposing of tariffs will be a new scope on the economy in terms of adaptability. The possibility of a second term was arising long before November 2024. Smart companies could have adapted and started manufacturing in the US. Now those who didn't are the ones complaining. If you are eager to stay in business, you'll gonna have to adapt fast. This is what Trump aims to do. Reduce unemployment by punishing those who are against it. Besides the guy in the video is obv complaining because his already low sales will be slashed and his low quality products will see the low quality products fate: Insolvency. This video is too anti-trump but that's just my opinion.

US has endemic trade deficit, an unemployment . Simply, it tells that American consume more than what they consume! Putting tariffs will not solve the problem, since nearshoring and re-industrializing needs workers, which are not there. US do not needs to reduce it's import, it needs to increase the value of what it export!  This tells that US manufacturing is not that productive if it cannot compete against most other nations in its own battleground... Furthermore, if US has been capable to sustain protracted trade deficit without impoverishing itseld, it is because the deficit is counterbalanced by the influx of capitals from foreign countries. And this is where US outperform anybody else, and shall focus on.

I will be back here to smile when you guys start regretting these tariffs. For me it’s common sense I’m just amazed at how many people do not recognize this. 

Say, You impose tariff on drinking water, international drinking water goes up to $20 per bottle local manufacturers can and will increase their prices from $2 to anywhere between $5-$18 because it will still be cheaper than the imported water. And customers have no better alternative. Also the “tariffs” will be paid by the Final consumer as the cost is PASSED ON to them. Do you really think the manufacturer or producer will pay for the tariffs? It’s the importer who pays and then adds that amount to the price of the goods. Which will then be paid by you the consumer. 
And I haven’t even talked about retaliatory tariffs by the foreign countries which will shrink your exports so you lose export jobs and pay more for your domestic goods how is that a gain? ️

I understand that tariffs cause prices to go up. What I don't understand is why a country would retaliate by causing the prices to go up on their own people. What Canada should do is an embargo. Choose a product like Jack Daniels for example, from a Trump friendly state, and completely embargo that product. Coordinate with other countries to target specific products and shut them down one by one. That would hurt. Also, tariffs are used to try to cause people to stop buying products outside of their country and make it less expensive (comparably) to buy from within. Look at the labor force available in the US. It's pretty low and soon to get lower. That means companies will have to pay more to draw workers away and other companies will have to pay more to retain workers. This causes inflation within a country, which is how we got where we are now. Break the cycle and use the embargo instead. At least take a vote and let the people decide.

The Canadian dollar fell immdiately after the news about 25% tariffs came out and is expected to fall by up to 20% in the coming weeks or months. This means the net increase for the American importers is only 5% to 10% which may be absorbed resulting in negligble increase for the American consumers. US government gains 25% in tarrifs, importers win in terms of currency exchange and minimum impact to the American consumers.

No, not all products American pay the tariffs. There are lots dosmestically produced products, if the imported ones don't win the market--whether due to the domestic ones offer lower prices, higher quality, other any reasons--then only the foriegn importer/exporters pay tariffs without be able to resell them to the end users.

Or.. new jobs for all those extra civil servants (paid by the American tax payers) who will have to check all these creative ways to avoid tariffs. Trump is the best example of someone who  avoided paying taxes his whole life.  I don't think other countries can't be as creative.

64,fantastic documentary. praying that we won’t go under
65,Hahahahaha  Americans will pay more for their imported goods..  Basic knowledge.   Ignorence is bliss.
66,">The United States used to be a manufacturing country. Since the end of the Second World War this changed from a manufacturing center to a consumer center. All governments since the end of that conflict have been increasing the national debt, all of which has devalued the US dollar to the point where, today, a US dollar is worth about three cents, yes three cents, compared with a 1971 US dollar. So, today all the consuming US public is consuming with devalued dollars, hence, the increase in the sticker price of all goods and services. We simply need more of these devalued dollars to buy anything.
>The plan by the current US government to install these tariffs is a distraction from the real problem which is the US debt and the devalued US dollar. Currently, the US debt to GDP ratio is well over 100% and so the only way to get this ratio down is either to pay down the debt or to increase the productivity of the nation. The former is out of the question; the second option will take maybe twenty to thirty years. The latter is not unrealistic since it really took over forty years to create this problem in the first place. 
>With regard to the stated deficit in trade with Canada this is a complete falsehood. If one were to include services as well as goods, then the deficit would be dramatically altered. In addition, the US imports over four million barrels of oil each day. This oil is shipped at deep discounts which allows the US refineries to sell the finished product on the open market generating huge profits. The statements by the US President are misleading, incomplete and false. We are living in dangerous times. The last thing a leader ought to be doing is turning on its trusted and reliable ally. He will pay for this and so will the American people. Just wait until they go the grocery store or the gas station.
>This whole charade will not end well. Canada should immediately reform the inter-provincial trade barriers and should continue to forge new alliances around the world, including with China, India and the other BRICS nations. The US is in decline. The Americans do not appreciate what we, Canada, represent. Once the trust is broken it will never be restored. Canada should turn away from the whole misconception that the US is our friend and ally. 
It is not!

China got so crazy rich by putting strict rules on foreign investors wanting to do business in their country for instance car manufacturers, they had to become allies with a local car manufacturer in order to produce their cars in china, now china sells more EVs than tesla, because they managed to get ahold of intel, let’s not talk about electronics or  even AI."

America has gone far and beyond to provide the infrastructure for global service economies that placed the West amongst developed nations, most prominently post-WW2. But since the '70s/80s, a new economic philosophy democratised value chains through new capital markets that allowed unforeseen economies to take over all aspects of competencies gained through outsourcing. If you're short sighted you'd view it as a tax on ""you"", but the reality is Trump's saying buckle your boots we're opening up our own shop. Its ironic and scary to see because as Clinton said, ""no country can escape the global economy,"" an economy in which America is the centre. I need a popcorn bucket and bunker to last 4 years."

The imposing of tariffs will be a new scope on the economy in terms of adaptability. The possibility of a second term was arising long before November 2024. Smart companies could have adapted and started manufacturing in the US. Now those who didn't are the ones complaining. If you are eager to stay in business, you'll gonna have to adapt fast. This is what Trump aims to do. Reduce unemployment by punishing those who are against it. Besides the guy in the video is obv complaining because his already low sales will be slashed and his low quality products will see the low quality products fate: Insolvency.

Putting tariffs will not solve the problem, since nearshoring and re-industrializing needs workers, which are not there. US do not needs to reduce it's import, it needs to increase the value of what it export!  This tells that US manufacturing is not that productive if it cannot compete against most other nations in its own battleground... Furthermore, if US has been capable to sustain protracted trade deficit without impoverishing itseld, it is because the deficit is counterbalanced by the influx of capitals from foreign countries. And this is where US outperform anybody else, and shall focus on."

178,"I will be back here to smile when you guys start regretting these tariffs. For me it’s common sense I’m just amazed at how many people do not recognize this. 

Say, You impose tariff on drinking water, international drinking water goes up to $20 per bottle local manufacturers can and will increase their prices from $2 to anywhere between $5-$18 because it will still be cheaper than the imported water. And customers have no better alternative. Also the “tariffs” will be paid by the Final consumer as the cost is PASSED ON to them. Do you really think the manufacturer or producer will pay for the tariffs? It’s the importer who pays and then adds that amount to the price of the goods. Which will then be paid by you the consumer. 
And I haven’t even talked about retaliatory tariffs by the foreign countries which will shrink your exports so you lose export jobs and pay more for your domestic goods how is that a gain? ️"

195,"I understand that tariffs cause prices to go up. What I don't understand is why a country would retaliate by causing the prices to go up on their own people. What Canada should do is an embargo. Choose a product like Jack Daniels for example, from a Trump friendly state, and completely embargo that product. Coordinate with other countries to target specific products and shut them down one by one. That would hurt. Also, tariffs are used to try to cause people to stop buying products outside of their country and make it less expensive (comparably) to buy from within. Look at the labor force available in the US. It's pretty low and soon to get lower. That means companies will have to pay more to draw workers away and other companies will have to pay more to retain workers. This causes inflation within a country, which is how we got where we are now. Break the cycle and use the embargo instead. At least take a vote and let the people decide."

215,"Just become a mega cultists then you’ll have nothing to worry about, except for how to spend all this new money you’ll be getting from the government of Trump"
216,BOHICA. Here comes Season 2 folks.
217,I wonder if there is an app that auto mutes his voice?

241,It will bite him back
242,We could have the supply chain right here in America like it used to be
243,Just make it in America then! That’s the whole point!
244,“This is not a tax on other countries. This is a tax on you.” WRONG. This is a tax on foreign made goods. If baldey made his products in the US and employed US workers and manufacturing he would not have this problem. That's exactly the point of these Tariffs too: MAKE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING GREAT AGAIN.

252,Maybe i wasn't paying enough attention but when did the narrator mention that Biden kept all of Trump's tariffs and then added some? Or was it okay when the other guy did it?

259,"Tariff, then why not produce made in USA"
260,That guy from Jlabs should make his products in a country that is Not our enemy.

262,"The Canadian dollar fell immdiately after the news about 25% tariffs came out and is expected to fall by up to 20% in the coming weeks or months. This means the net increase for the American importers is only 5% to 10% which may be absorbed resulting in negligble increase for the American consumers. US government gains 25% in tarrifs, importers win in terms of currency exchange and minimum impact to the American consumers."
263,"No, not all products American pay the tariffs. There are lots dosmestically produced products, if the imported ones don't win the market--whether due to the domestic ones offer lower prices, higher quality, other any reasons--then only the foriegn importer/exporters pay tariffs without be able to resell them to the end users."

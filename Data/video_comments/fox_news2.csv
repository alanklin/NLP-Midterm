Tariffs are a tax on you, retaliation by us will cost you and us.

Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..

""When inventor Frederick Banting discovered insulin in 1923, he refused to put his name on the patent. He felt it was unethical for a doctor to profit from a discovery that would save lives. Banting‚Äôs co-inventors, James Collip and Charles Best, sold the insulin patent to the University of Toronto for a mere $1. They wanted everyone who needed their medication to be able to afford it.""

That's why the insulin is very cheap in Canada and a fortune in the USA. Mentality!

You're probably only going to pay more for the same products from china for example. It takes years to set-up any kind of infrastructure to manufacture things back in america and consumers will still end up paying more for american labour. Here's an example, I have a business that currently buys a product for 3 dollars and now having to pay 5 for the same fue to tariffs. After another 5 years when and if at all american manufacturing is set-up, it will probably cost me 7 dollars to buy the same product in an american made factory as compared to a chinese made factory due to labour. What do you think businesses are going to choose? 

I'm not anti-trump but for anyone to not think this is stupid is beyond me.

American middle class will suffer fast with 25% tariffs on Canadian imports.  Be prepared to lose money and prepare to spend $3,000 per month per household in addition to what you are already spending on... Don't celebrate too fast America. This will be a road of suffering up ahead for you all,  and yes for us too Canadians.  Probably a lot worse than you think it'd hit for both countries.  The world, including us Canadians won't forget this and hope you won't too.

Dr. Kelley, who also had vast experience as a business consultant, was the author of a then-widely used textbook called Marketing Intelligence -- The Management of Marketing Information (originally published by P. Staples, London, 1968).  Dr. Kelley taught marketing management to both undergraduate and graduate students at Wharton.  Trump was an undergraduate student at Wharton for the latter two of his college years, having been graduated in 1968.

Federal investigators in Canada just recently took down the largest most sophisticated drug super lab in Canada. The combined fentanyl and precursors seized at this facility could have amounted to over 95,500,000 potentially lethal doses of fentanyl that would have entered Canada and exported abroad to the USA (approximately 1/3 the population of the US). How is this ""miniscule"" as this facility has been running successfully for quite some time. This never made much media coverage in Canada because it was an embarrassment that this lab was running at all, and even less media coverage in the US.

Here are potential flaws with the argument that tariffs cost Americans $1,000 to $1,200 per year:

Economic Assumptions: Estimates depend on certain economic assumptions which may not be accurate.

Redistribution Effects: Doesn't account for how tariff revenues are used.

Consumer Behavior: Assumes consumers will continue to buy the same goods at higher prices without adjusting behavior.

Short-Term vs. Long-Term Impact: Focuses on short-term effects, ignoring potential long-term benefits.

Generalization: The average cost may not reflect the actual impact on individual households.

Countermeasures: Businesses may take measures to reduce the impact on consumers.

Where were all you tariff soliders when biden not only extended the tariffs trump put on china in 2016 but added more tariffs on china in sep 2024? We are going to be fine people. Tariffs are a negotiating tool that works but Canada,Mexico and many other countries are going to have to trade  fairly if they want to keep trading with us or we can just make our own products here but  either way, they  trade fairly with us or dont trade at all but we need a level playing field.

As a Canadian, I use to look at the labels and try to buy items that said ""Made in Canada"" or ""Made in USA"" because even if it cost more, I was putting my dollars behind North American made goods.  ""Made in USA"" IMHO stood for quality.  Unfortunately over the years, there are fewer goods made in North America so sometimes my hands are tied.  These tariffs are a slap in the face.  Will still buy ""Made in Canada"" but actively look to boycot US made goods.  I'm only one voice but I'm certain many of my fellow Canadians feel the same.

Listen, this technological competition between us and China/others is basically national security issue. We need US products, manufacturing and rely on Chinese good made by slaves. Tariffs can replace tax on goods and Trump sees tariffs as a good solution for Americans and our country.

Interesting fact, Canada imports 1.64 million cars a year from the USA, while Canada only exports 254,000 cars to the USA each year.

The US is in 30 plus trillion dollars of debt while countries like Canada have close to no debt, the US foots the bill for world stability and is the most generous country on the planet yet they have the nerve to complain when asked to contribute more. Its actually sickening to hear their responses. We don't want to hear the B.S. but we are friends crap. If the US doesn't reduce its debt the world will suffer so start contributing and throw out that friend card.

Tariffs like this haven‚Äôt been seen in decades because they aren‚Äôt helpful. The reason we do some things and no longer do other things is because we feel the things we do are better than the things we formerly did. Things that are no longer done have been stopped for a reason. We even have sayings about the wisdom of the idea of Adopting Best Practices

Trade tariffs may seem like a tool for economic protection, but in reality, they create challenges for both Canada and the U.S. For American consumers, tariffs mean higher prices on goods, disrupted supply chains, and economic strain on industries reliant on Canadian imports. For Canada, retaliatory measures can impact key sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and energy, leading to job losses and economic instability. Despite these challenges, Canada has always been resilient. We have weathered trade disputes before and will continue to protect our economy and sovereignty. Let‚Äôs be clear‚ÄîCanada is not the 51st state. We are a strong, independent nation that values fair trade and economic cooperation. Tariffs only hurt both sides, and history has shown that collaboration, not division, is the path to long-term prosperity for both countries. A strong U.S.-Canada partnership benefits us all.

If you like avocados but don‚Äôt want to pay an exhoberant price on it, DON‚ÄôT BUY IT  it‚Äôs as simple as that. If you like a Canadian syrup but don‚Äôt want to break your bank then buy the American one that you don‚Äôt like but don‚Äôt hate either. There‚Äôs choices in our capitalist economy, nobody is forcing you to buy avocados, buy Canadian syrup, buy anything. It‚Äôs always about preferences. If for some reason you need to buy that Canadian syrup or buy that avocado well then buy it knowing that it will be expensive and might help you in asking ‚Äúwhere can we look for cheaper alternatives‚Äù. Buy shifting preferences you‚Äôll also tell Canada and Mexico that they better change their economic practices because then the USA market will then no longer demand as much product out of them and other countries may or may not take in that extra products then forcing them to lobby their government which is what trump is counting on. They depend on American consumers in buying their products. We can save by not buying from them while they will definitely loose if we buy them or not either way. There‚Äôs no need to spend 2-3 dollars more on Canadian syrup or .75 to 1.15 extra on just one avocado if you don‚Äôt want to

If Trump and MAGA paid attention in history class, the word Tariffs will never be in their vocabulary. Any of these geniuses know what happened on June 17th, 1930 when Republican led Congress passed and Herbert Hoover signed the Hawley-Smoot Tariffs Act into the law? Maybe these geniuses never heard of the Great Depression that followed.

Market capitalism will naturally drive prices down.  Competition for customers will drive prices down.  Plus when Trump gets rid of federal income tax, your paycheck will get fatter.  Tariffs on American products don't seem to bother them.

The largest thing US imports from Canada is oil. Buys 300 billion then refines it and sells a bunch back to canada and the rest wherever for 500 billion. If these tarrifs continue for to long canada will finish there pipeline to the west coast and build their own western refinery for heavy crude. US will lose their 200 billion proffit. Plus canada will no longer have to sell at about 10% below market value as they will have alternative markets

Trumps idea of how Tariffs work..
Eggs are $3,87 a dozen in Canada. 
Canada decides to export eggs to the US for that price. 
Trumps tariff on Canadian imports is 100% 
Therefore Canada pays America $3,77 tax for every dozen eggs in exports to the US at $3,77 per dozen. .
Should work

So prices are set in America by the cost of American manufacturing, even if the price to manufacture in China is pennies on the dollar.  The Chinese make it for 50 cents and sell it for $10 but the American product cost $4 to make and is sold at $12.  These tariffs just will make the corporations less money because if they raise the price to the made in American price then no one will buy the Chinese version.

What does picking a fight with my closest neighbor and ally say about me to the world? Whichever trade and political deal I made in the past was bilateral, and as such can never be the ""fault"" of just one participant. But picking a fight over nonsensical lies with my closest neighbor and ally tells the rest of the world that I should not be picked as a friend. Of course I can coerce and bully all over the place, but at some point that will not work. But do I really want to live like that while all this is going on? Am i really happy and capable of being alone? Maybe, but maybe not. History tells me that I'll fight a lot and die at the end. I could be special though and change all that history thought me.

For all of those arguing with the tariffs. 

Yes both country citizens will hurt in the short term but imo will be better for long term. For Americans, go to the government census website on trade between US and these countries. We import BILLIONs more than they import from the US and have for years. We are supporting their economy significantly more than they are helping ours. Evening out the balance sheet has to be done at some point. 

You can‚Äôt argue with the discrepancy although I do wish he didn‚Äôt take such a harsh action.

I think in the end with Tariffs we can get rid of personal income taxes and make America more competitive bringing more industry back to America and exporting more.

This is an incredible business opportunity for entrepreneurs. All these goods that are manufactured or produced in other countries because they have cheap labor, can now be produced in the US. There is going to be a big void that can be filled by enterprising Americans. This will create thousands of jobs. Does anyone want a coat, a pair of shoes, an avocado, a cell phone, or a car, so badly that they are willing to have people work in slave like conditions to produce that for them, so they can get it cheaper than an American made product? Yes, prices may go up, but so will income, and our national security will stronger. Does anyone remember the 1973 oil embargo? When OPEC stopped producing oil so they could raise the price, it almost crippled America because we were so dependent on them for energy. We can not let the fate of this country be controlled by other nations that produce products we rely on, that could suddenly cut us off. That is not national security.

Or you can tell your boss to pay you less, so the cost of production is less and therefore the selling price might be less. Fingers crossed.

I just want to point out a lot of my fellow farmers made more money in subsides than they lost in tariffs during DJT's  first administration. Guess those of us who voted for him wanted another four years off?? Who's the ""welfare queens"" now?? 

People don't understand that something like 77% of our fresh and frozen vegetables come from Mexico., for example. These price hikes hit our elderly, poor, children and other vulnerable people first and hardest. So much for a ""Christian"" nation. Because if you support this,band claim to be Christian YOU are at ofds with your savior. 
 In the US less than 2% of us are farming. We're on average 65 years old!!!!!! It's almost impossible to stay in farming, even if we're born into it. We can't just spring more farmers out of the ground it's a SKILLED TRADE.  As is ALL of the other tradesmen and our laborers who support the industry. 
If the feed trucks stop coming, cities will be out of food in 72 HOURS. 
Get a grip people, or enjoy eating your money. Because know what? I raise food, fuel and fiber. Me, mine, my peers, neighbors and friends will be fine. As far the rest? Enjoy your breadlines.

Who the hell advised him that this would be a good idea. not only has it made your country look ridiculous it‚Äôs also made everything literally everything more expensive because of globalisations, it‚Äôs not the 1950s. Why do you think there‚Äôs free trade agreements exist? you clowns that think tariffs were a good ideas.

Wonder if Trump knows how the oil development takes. I worked in the oil industry for years and it takes years to put energy production on line. Drill baby drill sounds good but it takes capital,planning,iron,production equipment and expertise at all stages. Scaling up overnight is not realistic.

13,"It's not about left VS right,  it's all about rich VS poor and working class Americans especially now."
14,Putin just sitting back sipping his tea- ‚Äú never interrupt your enemy when they are making a mistake ‚Äú
15,Can anyone tell me why we would tariff our friends (Canada) 25% but our enemy (China) only 10%. Is that common sense???
16,"If you have advanced financing, thank you Jesus, a beneficiary of $32,000, sourced from an economical situation."
17,Tariff hurts the average American plian and simple
18,"THIS IS A TAX ON AMERICANS! WAKE UP, PEOPLE!"
19,"Trump with just 2 weeks in office has destroyed  over 100 years of frienship between two great countries.
I as a  Canadian am sad to see this happen.
I have friends and family married and living in the US, for decades my parents lived 6 months of the year in Florida and had many American friends.
Tariffs are a tax on you, retaliation by us will cost you and us.
I haven't heard a single economist say this a good idea.
A bully never wins.
Trump is a reckless bully."
20,"When your trade deficit is driven by ENERGY provided at a DISCOUNT by a NEIGHBOR , this seems disrespectful."
21,"Sorry Canada and Mexico, we havee a stupid president "
22,Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..
23,'Brave New World' I think we moved past the dystopian novel phase into the horror genre when planes started falling out of the sky.
24,Henry Kissinger: ‚ÄúBeing an enemy of America is dangerous. Being a friend of America can be fatal‚Äù.
25,"""When inventor Frederick Banting discovered insulin in 1923, he refused to put his name on the patent. He felt it was unethical for a doctor to profit from a discovery that would save lives. Banting‚Äôs co-inventors, James Collip and Charles Best, sold the insulin patent to the University of Toronto for a mere $1. They wanted everyone who needed their medication to be able to afford it.""

That's why the insulin is very cheap in Canada and a fortune in the USA. Mentality!"
26,"Trump is Billionaire. When egg prices hit $50 a piece, he'll still be able to buy. What about you? Tarrifs are terrible tactics, especially on your immediate neighbors. Very dumb move."
27,Every country VS. USA - whats the worst that can happen‚Ä¶. Right?
28,"The whole world is perplexed, not just Canada."
29,The joke is when manufacturing comes back its the robots that will be doing the work lol
30,This makes me so sad I thought he said less wars why r we fighting Canada?
31,"Prices are going to skyrocket.  Remember conservatives, YOU voted for this.  YOU were pissed because you though that prices got higher under President Biden (they didn't).  YOU are going to reap the rewards of your votes."
32,He went from ‚ÄúIm going to lower prices‚Äù to ‚Äúshort term pain‚Äù man he tricked you guys 
33,"America has a surplus with canada , Your president is dumb."
34,"Americans before the election: ""prices are too high!""
Americans after the election: ""I don't mind paying higher prices as long as it is made in USA.""

What if all those companies American people think will start producing in USA simply decide not to?

More: if these companies decide to start to open plants across USA how do you find employees with such a low unemployment rate?"
35,"When you go grocery shopping, you will see what you did to all us....."
36,Wow none of you understand how international relations and commerce works...
37,How much coke did Jonathan do before this interview?
38,"Do you mean the USMCA fixed nothing and wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgreat deal, the best most beautiful deal anyone has ever made‚Äù. Who was the clown who negotiated that, they should be removed from government."
39,America is responsible for securing its border not Canada. Tariff war has to be the most stupid thing I've ever hear of especially with your biggest trading partners.Theres a huge deficit with Canada because there is 330million people in USA and 40 in Canada
40,Yall already can't afford groceries 
41,Tariffs made the great depression great.
42,"Which country has the highest debt?
United States."
43,They should outlaw ‚Äúlobbyists‚Äù
44,Let‚Äôs go CANADA üá®üá¶ let‚Äôs stand TOGETHER!!
45,"You're probably only going to pay more for the same products from china for example. It takes years to set-up any kind of infrastructure to manufacture things back in america and consumers will still end up paying more for american labour. Here's an example, I have a business that currently buys a product for 3 dollars and now having to pay 5 for the same fue to tariffs. After another 5 years when and if at all american manufacturing is set-up, it will probably cost me 7 dollars to buy the same product in an american made factory as compared to a chinese made factory due to labour. What do you think businesses are going to choose? 

I'm not anti-trump but for anyone to not think this is stupid is beyond me."
46,"33 states rank Canada as their main receiver of exports, for 7 more, Canada is in the top 3. Everything the USA produces can be gotten elsewhere."
47,"American middle class will suffer fast with 25% tariffs on Canadian imports.  Be prepared to lose money and prepare to spend $3,000 per month per household in addition to what you are already spending on... Don't celebrate too fast America. This will be a road of suffering up ahead for you all,  and yes for us too Canadians.  Probably a lot worse than you think it'd hit for both countries.  The world, including us Canadians won't forget this and hope you won't too."
48,"WFT???    I'm sorry but this ' Brave New World "" talk is just nothing more in trusting our financial future to a guy who bankrupt a casino...."
49,"The last time we had tariffs this extreme was during Hoover's presidency, which drastically worsened the great depression. Thanks Trump!"
50,The Trump administration tariffs does it make no sense is not going to help the economy
51,"China responded with 75% tariffs,  and of course Canada, Mexico and Colombia but thank you ahead patriots for paying for Trump's  tax breaks for us millionaires!"
52,"""It doesn't matter if the stone hits the pitcher or the pitcher hits the stone; in either case, it will be bad for the pitcher."" Don Quixote"
53,Let‚Äôs call a spade a spade. Trump is trying to annex Canada using economic force.
54,"Let me educate you.  Cars built in Detroit are made up of parts, pieces, metals from Canada, Mexico and China.  You just raised the price of American vehicles for Americans.  How stupid is that!  Watch the layoffs"
55,Farmers are going to be thrilled when Canada puts an export tariff on potash
56,"Guess who is paying the tariffs ‚Ä¶. WE 

Build first and then have tariffs"
57,Most manufacturers aren't going to move their operations out of a world economy just to save American customers 25%.
58,I think he should stop the wars and NOT put tarrifs on neighboring countires.
59,I thought trump was to drain the swamp not hurt Canada
60,"Im a factory worker in Elkhart, Indiana. I make RVs. The line i work on sends 90% of our RVs to Canada.....we have been informed just now that layoffs are coming....make america great again..."
61,Enjoy the inflation passed onto the consumers.
62,This makes me do glad. Bout time America took a stand and not get crapped on.
63,"Good job Mexico and Canada, tariff things made in red states. Love from real Americans üá∫üá∏üá®üá¶ üá≤üáΩ"
64,Tariffs caused the Great Depression of the 1930 ‚Äòs
65,"Things have been great the past four years why change, can't afford food, can't buy a house, crime in the streets what's the problem?"
66,"Late Professor William T. Kelley taught Marketing at Wharton School of Business and Finance, University of Pennsylvania, for 31 years, ending with his retirement in 1982.  Dr. Kelley, who also had vast experience as a business consultant, was the author of a then-widely used textbook called Marketing Intelligence -- The Management of Marketing Information (originally published by P. Staples, London, 1968).  Dr. Kelley taught marketing management to both undergraduate and graduate students at Wharton.  Trump was an undergraduate student at Wharton for the latter two of his college years, having been graduated in 1968. 
Dr. Kelley  ""Donald Trump Was the Dumbest Goddam Student I Ever Had."""
67,Nothing good from tariff.
68,"BUT after the tariff on washing machines, 2 Korean companies opened plants in the USA. Now washing machines are cheaper than before the tariffs. SO, it takes time for benefits to appear."
69,"Federal investigators in Canada just recently took down the largest most sophisticated drug super lab in Canada. The combined fentanyl and precursors seized at this facility could have amounted to over 95,500,000 potentially lethal doses of fentanyl that would have entered Canada and exported abroad to the USA (approximately 1/3 the population of the US). How is this ""miniscule"" as this facility has been running successfully for quite some time. This never made much media coverage in Canada because it was an embarrassment that this lab was running at all, and even less media coverage in the US."
70,If you voted for lower prices you lost.
71,Isn't it about time trump was impeached again
72,"Make it IN America...This is not hard. Do that and it creates rock solid stability, which the markets love. President Trump is right again!"
73,"I like the fact that tariffs will cause more damage to red states,"
74,America needs to start building what we need here instead of relaying on other countries.
75,"Yes. We can grow  everything in the USA. Coffee in Kentucky. Avocados in North Dakota, bananas in Idaho, Pineapples in Nebraska...... "
76,Friends pay back their debts. Canada wake up!
77,"Ultimately, the US consumers will suffer,  especially the poor ones. China produces fentanyl and only 10% tariff has been imposed on them, and 25% tariff has been imposed on Canadian goods,  utterly ridiculous."
78,Tariff Mexico with landmines on our southern border.
79,Trump confirmed Canada is calling him tomorrow 
80,Canadas economy is smaller than texas
81,"As an American let me apologize for the utter economic stupidity of the U.S. government for initiating these tariffs and violating the USMCA that Trump negotiated and signed with you ‚Ä¶ and also for  the sheer ignorance of most Americans who are commenting on here that know nothing about economics, trade or tariffs. I support Trumps border policies  but I didn‚Äôt sign up for this utter tariff nonsense that is damaging both our countries ‚Ä¶"
82,Im getting a dog and nameing it Tarriff
83,"If it looks and acts like a duck then it has to be Methamphetamine.....If you say my comment makes no sense, well it's because us attacking US consumers pockets to hurt our allies and friends makes even less sense."
84,Trump's golden age will be as fake as his golden toilet.
85,"America wants hydro, crude, gasoline all cut off. Sounds like an amazing plan to me. Let's do it"
86,Worth it. America 1st
87,"Here are potential flaws with the argument that tariffs cost Americans $1,000 to $1,200 per year:

Economic Assumptions: Estimates depend on certain economic assumptions which may not be accurate.

Redistribution Effects: Doesn't account for how tariff revenues are used.

Consumer Behavior: Assumes consumers will continue to buy the same goods at higher prices without adjusting behavior.

Short-Term vs. Long-Term Impact: Focuses on short-term effects, ignoring potential long-term benefits.

Generalization: The average cost may not reflect the actual impact on individual households.

Countermeasures: Businesses may take measures to reduce the impact on consumers."
88,"Where were all you tariff soliders when biden not only extended the tariffs trump put on china in 2016 but added more tariffs on china in sep 2024? We are going to be fine people. Tariffs are a negotiating tool that works but Canada,Mexico and many other countries are going to have to trade  fairly if they want to keep trading with us or we can just make our own products here but  either way, they  trade fairly with us or dont trade at all but we need a level playing field."
89,"Just like Canada, you Americans kept buying cheap China junk. Not made in America! I told my friends, yes its great paying a lot less until they close ""your"" plant down. Well guess what? We the consumers are our own worst enemy. Don't blame anyone but yourself! Now we see two decent hard working economies taking it out on each other. Quite sad actually!"
90,"As a Canadian, I use to look at the labels and try to buy items that said ""Made in Canada"" or ""Made in USA"" because even if it cost more, I was putting my dollars behind North American made goods.  ""Made in USA"" IMHO stood for quality.  Unfortunately over the years, there are fewer goods made in North America so sometimes my hands are tied.  These tariffs are a slap in the face.  Will still buy ""Made in Canada"" but actively look to boycot US made goods.  I'm only one voice but I'm certain many of my fellow Canadians feel the same."
91,Tariffs won't change the fact that in most Democrat run cities they let you shoplift up to $900.00 per incident without consequences.
92,I thought we voted for trump to bring our bills down. I can‚Äôt afford to keep paying these high bills. Why did we do this?
93,"OK friends, keep your cheap beer and avocados.   We got all the best here in the US.  It's about time we support ours.

it's about time we support ours.  Buy US will keep more income here not outside."
94,1200.00 per year to keep fentanyl out of our country ? I‚Äôll spend a few cents per day for my fellow Americans.
95,Call them what they are - the Trump Tax. They weren't there before him. Glad Fox is finally reporting on this.
96,"Goods prices are increased, Americans do not buy or buying slows, company loses money, buying stays stagnant, companies continue to lose money, company lowers price to adjust for new market. Tariffs work if we do our part and buy American goods!"
97,They should make their products in the USA.
98,All these so called experts. One says this and another says the opposite!!
99,"Im not sure if you remember but it has been decades since our countries and industry were functional.  

We are hardly better off with what we have today compared to decades ago."
100,I'll gladly pay $90 more for a washing machine made by my fellow Americans!
101,It‚Äôs time to bring the manufacturing back to the US!
102,Do it!!!
103,"Major import is curde oil. It will hurt here in a little bit, once we start drilling, we wont need them. They need us more than we need them"
104,Canada and Mexico chose Tariffs over Boarder Security...
105,"Friendly countries don‚Äôt allow illegal aliens and fentanyl to cross the border.

Being friends is more than just speaking with a nice accent.  You have to actually act friendly!"
106,Not if we buy American products.
107,"Go, President Trump! There will always be unpopular but we NEED TO DO THIS! Suck it up!"
108,Trump should Leave hulio and the CARTELS Families Alone.....they Dont Play
109,"Our ""closest friends"" are robing us blind."
110,Mexico has nothing that i want. So good deal
111,"Where were all these economic experts during Biden, and we are here, economically?"
112,"25% tariff is nothing compared to how much companies save by manufacturing in Mexico, China Vs in Us"
113,"Just walk into WalMart or any other store and see how many products come from China and other countries.  This includes food. The difference is we can manufacture or grow these products here if needed, unlike others countries - we can take care of ourselves which creates more jobs."
114,"If i want to hear a liberals criticism, I will watch CNN"
115,No Pain No Gain
116,"Remember when America was tax free, tariffs did that. There ALL about patience!!"
117,1980 is when the wealth gap started getting bigger
118,"As a Canadian, I approve of the tariffs. We need to do what trump is doing, bring back industry so we won't be dependent on other countries. Brings jobs back to Canada. Also, like trump is trying to do, scrap the income tax and go to a tariff system. We need a doge as well. So much money wasted by this liberal government."
119,Last I checked auto industry was drying up cuz of electric car crap. So exactly what kind of crap cars will be impacted. Prices were already out of control. So will see.
120,This is retaliation for celebrating LUIGI. The rich hate your guts
121,It's about time we deal with this. It's gone on too long
122,"Listen, this technological competition between us and China/others is basically national security issue. We need US products, manufacturing and rely on Chinese good made by slaves. Tariffs can replace tax on goods and Trump sees tariffs as a good solution for Americans and our country."
123,"Interesting fact, Canada imports 1.64 million cars a year from the USA, while Canada only exports 254,000 cars to the USA each year."
124,"The US is in 30 plus trillion dollars of debt while countries like Canada have close to no debt, the US foots the bill for world stability and is the most generous country on the planet yet they have the nerve to complain when asked to contribute more. Its actually sickening to hear their responses. We don't want to hear the B.S. but we are friends crap. If the US doesn't reduce its debt the world will suffer so start contributing and throw out that friend card."
125,We will overcome
126,We need to start manufacturing again to create quality jobs ! All our companies have left !
127,"Great , now we have an explanation for how the egg prices are not going to drop after all"
128,"It appeared, Biden was a SHORT TERM economics man.
Trump is a LONG TERM economics man.
And in the long run, Trump is right to make the needed changes."
129,"They do set back, take a deep breath and just see what happens.Good things are gonna come from it.Take a deep breath"
130,"All US markets are down significantly this morning. US oil prices are well up and his buddy Musk. Tesla stock is down 7.5%. 

Off to a great start.. what a clown. "
131,We tried to tell you tariffs are taxes.   The Trump voters who were complaining about the price of eggs did not listen.

136,"Tariffs like this haven‚Äôt been seen in decades because they aren‚Äôt helpful. The reason we do some things and no longer do other things is because we feel the things we do are better than the things we formerly did. Things that are no longer done have been stopped for a reason. We even have sayings about the wisdom of the idea of Adopting Best Practices
Why repeat mistakes?"
137,I would not mind to pay more if it is made in American.
138,I went to target and everything in there was made in china. I so frustrated. I was looking for plates made in the USA.

148,"My friend who always needs money also calls me his best friend.

149,The best way to rejuvenate an economy is by cutting red tape and taxes as well as government spending. Tariffs are an indirect tax on consumers and they generate unefficiencies.
150,PLEASE LEARN SOME ECONOMICS!! Tariffs are actually good for Israel. Israel will benefit a lot with reduced competition. The much needed money circulation between Israel and US will be restored

155,Jonathan's spray tan is on point!
156,"Americans cannot afford products made in America, by Americans!!! It will take a while to get there, not just a ""little pain"""
157,Tariff everyone and if it's to expensive don't buy it. That's how Tariffs work then they come to the table or go out of business.
158,Tariffs got nothing to do with friendship or being alies.  Boycott?  good we can have our own here in the United States.   We make the best of products in the world.
159,President Trump knows what he‚Äôs doing. Let‚Äôs give him a chance. It can‚Äôt be worse than the last 4 years.

174,Buy American made‚Ä¶
175,"I've made a statue of Dirty Harry in my pottery class.  Go ahead, bake my clay. "
176,But wait didn't trump say he was going to lower prices.
177,Jonathan: don‚Äôt let the door hit you on the way out
178,We've been paying tariffs for years and it‚Äôs OK the second we start charging the world goes nuts. Tired of the US having to pay for everything but when we ask for equal treatment its a crime
179,It's a pity that the markets don't like people who go back on their word
180,"One thing critics don't understand - yes these tarifs will cause some pain to americans, prices will increase but for targeted countries it wont be just pain, for them it will be devastation. Retaliatory tarifs wont work, the only thing that would work is to comply with demands of America or go bancrupt"
181,"Finally our US GOVERNMENT is being put on a Budget and Now finally charging other countries to sell in our Beautiful country. I‚Äôm all for Tariffs for the Long term benefit, and I understand that‚Äôs going to raise prices on foreign products."

190,"Two hours in and Trump is already making progress, the guy is an amazing negotiator."
191,"Canada and Mexico place a 25%tariff Tuesday morning, we should place an additional 50% tariff on their goods Tuesday afternoon."
192,If my food bill goes up any more I will have to cut out a couple of meals each week. I can't believe I voted for this guy. I am such a fool. I can't afford this...
193,"""In Fiscal Year 2024, USCBP seized 21,148 pounds of fentanyl at the southwest border, mostly smuggled from Mexico. In contrast, only 43 pounds were intercepted at the northern border. This means that less than 1% of all fentanyl seizures occurred at the U.S.-Canada border."" Source Forbes."
194,Jonathan looks like Tucker from There‚Äôs Something About Mary
195,Tariffs are a leverage tool. But they can be  permanent tax collectors to replace the IRS.
196,No pain No Gain  President Trump has my support
197,The CCP is loving this high five everywhere
198,"We are a dying nation‚Ä¶ like a dying animal grasping for air, 
Very erratic and unpredictable"
199,They're literally enthusiastically talking through smiles while they're saying  the U.S. stock market going to tank along with rising prices for U.S. consumers.
200,Now fox has to convince the minions its good to pay more.
201,Why did he back down on the tariffs ? In exchange for the meaningless promise that they'd send a handful of symbolic security guards to the border? What a joke.
202,"‚ÄôWe should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends‚Äîweakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world‚Äîall while cynically waving the American flag.‚Äô - Ronald Reagan"
203,"With the president being a huge fan of McDonalds, Trump imposing 25% on a country where we get a lot of our fruits/vegetables from doesn‚Äôt surprise me."
204,Americans have no idea how this will hurt them
205,"Tariff is good, US being import heavy is upside down. Tariffs will help build that corpus. If the world boycotts petro dollar then its another thing"
206,"Logic:

If you raise taxes on businesses, they just pass those costs on to the consumer.

If you lower taxes on businesses, they just pocket the extra money.

There sure are a lot of economists in the comment section."
207,I'm all for it.  I wish it would be more. I like to stop doing business with them all together.  If there's American companies down their i would give them 6 months to close all their plants.  For both countries.  They knew what they were doing change their environment drastically.
208,Go Trump USA USA USA Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
209,"These kinds of people said, oooh i can't afford groceries anymore because of Biden, yet now they're saying, sure we voted for tarrifs to make groceries a lot more expensive "
210,Canada is a friend but a bottom low T type friend.
211,Sometimes it is good to shake things up a bit.!!
212,Mexico and Canada already charge tariffs on American products.
213,"Don't worry, the pain will be short term. Just give Donald 2 weeks to flatten the curve."
214,This is such an idiotic strategy‚Ä¶ market has already tanked. Income taxes better be minimal
215,Canada imposing tariff is like me seing mushroom price go up. Who hell needs mushroom in daily life? 
216,Now that Trump is in office MAGA will happily pay more for food and goods.
217,Do orders already given being cancelled by the Tariffs? I fear Companies will need to pay 25% on goods they have Contracts on already. But Car sale will get on hold. Nobody is paying 25%-50% more for a new Car if they are NOT in dire need of a NEW Car.
218,looks like I will be getting a 25% Cola Increase in my Social Security in 2026.. haha.. YAH RIGHT !!!  
219,"People in the comments probably have never negotiated their salary. It's a word game, a bluff game "
220,He should have increased his energy production before getting close to Bering shut off from Canada
221,"No exemptions , they either open their markets to our products or we keep doubling tariffs every month"
222,"I love how nobody knows how the hell this will play out ‚Ä¶. The experts on twitter sure have their say , but we won‚Äôt know until we are personally impacted by this . FYI I‚Äôm in Mexico , people here aren‚Äôt in any panic."
223,This is very sad for Americans. Regardless of party preference (or apathy).
224,"If Canadians are perplexed about the tariffs, try working with us on fentanyl and the border like we asked. I mean, wouldn't that be the neighborly thing to do?"
225,Difference is only Canada and the US might actually sustain enough through it all.
226,"The prices will rise
But the drilling of the oil will drop them"
227,"$1200 additionally a year?  That's 3.28 additionally a day! Seriously, that's leas than a cup of coffee these days. Buy alternatives, if available, or don't buy at all if $3.28 a day will hurt your wallet. People are overreacting right now, just calm down and see how it all plays out. It's only been a couple days and everyone is throwing up their arms, screaming that the end is near! Holy moly people, take it easy, don't give yourselves a heart attack. $3.28 a DAY. NOT THE END OF THE WORLD!"
228,"Trade tariffs may seem like a tool for economic protection, but in reality, they create challenges for both Canada and the U.S. For American consumers, tariffs mean higher prices on goods, disrupted supply chains, and economic strain on industries reliant on Canadian imports. For Canada, retaliatory measures can impact key sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and energy, leading to job losses and economic instability. Despite these challenges, Canada has always been resilient. We have weathered trade disputes before and will continue to protect our economy and sovereignty. Let‚Äôs be clear‚ÄîCanada is not the 51st state. We are a strong, independent nation that values fair trade and economic cooperation. Tariffs only hurt both sides, and history has shown that collaboration, not division, is the path to long-term prosperity for both countries. A strong U.S.-Canada partnership benefits us all."
229,And Mexico already came to the table and has come to an agreement to postpone the tariffs. Looks like its working to me.
230,Just like that the orange man has folded no tariffs.
231,"""During every single day of the Trump Administration, I will very simply put America first."" ~President Donald J. Trump, Jan 20th 2025"
232,Importation is the problem. Build it here or be gone.
233,"Wow! Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in 2014, .was .96.  Now it is, .69.    What have the Canadians been over spending their money on?"
234,This is what you get when you elect someone so dumb and insecure that all they do is throw their weight around at every opportunity.
235,Trump is gonna regret this
236,No problem with $1200/yr to get manufacturing back in the US!
237,"If we are to endure this unprecedented reaction to the USA s unfair treatment then Pres.Trump must give us some stimulas,please!!!!!!!"
238,No pain we will not gain later. 100% support tariff to protect American businesses here.
239,"What I don‚Äôt understand is if the tariffs hurt us American citizens and not the country they‚Äôre being put on, why do they care so much about having the tariffs on them? If we‚Äôre paying them"
240,"3:48 for God sakes. Where were all these ‚Äúeconomists‚Äù since 2021 when prices went up 40%? They never scurried around freaking out then.  Oh, but Trump‚Ä¶ "
241,3/4 of 1 tenth of a percent of our gdp vs. 77% of theirs....... Who's going to feel it worse?
242,"Thank you Canada for your response to a bully. Waiting for Mexico!!! Humbleness and diplomacy are words that our leader Trump doesn‚Äôt recognize. We must be humble, we don‚Äôt know when we will need our allies friends."
243,"Wow, this guy is way too animated. The good news is I probably burn extra calories just watching him."
244,Bring your manufacturing into the USA and the tariff won't apply to you.  Hellllooooo!? 
245,"What I hate is the absolutenesss of the economists about ‚Äúthe American consumer will be affected‚Äù when in reality yes but there‚Äôs a catch. If you like avocados but don‚Äôt want to pay an exhoberant price on it, DON‚ÄôT BUY IT  it‚Äôs as simple as that. If you like a Canadian syrup but don‚Äôt want to break your bank then buy the American one that you don‚Äôt like but don‚Äôt hate either. There‚Äôs choices in our capitalist economy, nobody is forcing you to buy avocados, buy Canadian syrup, buy anything. It‚Äôs always about preferences. If for some reason you need to buy that Canadian syrup or buy that avocado well then buy it knowing that it will be expensive and might help you in asking ‚Äúwhere can we look for cheaper alternatives‚Äù. Buy shifting preferences you‚Äôll also tell Canada and Mexico that they better change their economic practices because then the USA market will then no longer demand as much product out of them and other countries may or may not take in that extra products then forcing them to lobby their government which is what trump is counting on. They depend on American consumers in buying their products. We can save by not buying from them while they will definitely loose if we buy them or not either way. There‚Äôs no need to spend 2-3 dollars more on Canadian syrup or .75 to 1.15 extra on just one avocado if you don‚Äôt want to"
246,Tariffs are such a dumb idea im starting to think Trump was lying this whole time
247,"Always build in your own home. Do not rely on others. If you do, they have the upper hand. Make it in the USA. Better product."
248,"The pain people will feel in a short term he says 
Me sitting down looking how America burns"
249,"We Americans will die on this hill, Tariffs are the new thing. 
Get used to it world."
250,We should be making these items here in USA.
251,Or maybe the other countries could just comply with reasonable requests to stop migration and drug trafficking.
252,"A good neighbor or partner would never let the US pay 900 Billion Dollars a year for defense while they pay 26 Billion. In that way each and every tax payer (half of America) is paying for Canadas security and defense worldwide all while Canada says the US owes them money. That's Ludacris, Canada needs to start being the Partner to the US that they claim to be."
253,"Every year we have a deficit with other countries. It's draining. Trickling and pouring money out of our country which the end thereof is destruction for us as American people. Yes, we might feel feel the hurt but it's necessary for the future of our descendants."
254,Insane. All these people here are in a sinking ship but they refuse to bail because their jackets may get wet while bailing. Self serving traitors. Go Trump and right this sinking ship.
255,"Mexico came to the table, Trudeau hasn‚Äôt clued in yet"
256,Trump is about to find out how nice Canadians can be.
257,It's the same thing with lobbyists! Instead of Lobbying for Income tax deductions and credits. Corporations will lobby  for tariffs waivers.
258,I‚Äôm fine changing my spending habits and buying American made products
259,Why are we importing these things. Just make it here.
260,"Lady from Canada.....""We are your closest friend, neighbor"".....yes, and you have been ripping us off for years."
261,I don't remember this being part of his campaign. Why are goods from Canada going to cost more than goods coming from China?
262,Bring it back home! American made quality that lasts! 
263,If America is your partner or allies ‚Ä¶.. then imports should be fair to both sides‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
264,These politicians are ignorant of economics.
265,We need look to the long term future. Oil prices come down & a strong policy to keep these other companies bringing down their prices over drop of fuel prices & not price gouging the public we will be OK
266,These tarrifs would be good if the economy was superb and everything wasnt almost too expensive
267,"CONSUME PRODUCTS MADE IN THE USA. SUPERIOR QUALITY.
AMERICA FIRSTüá∫üá∏Ô∏èüá∫üá∏Ô∏è"
268,Which = USA been taken advantage of for DECADES
269,"""There will be pain."" But trump in his ivory tower won't feel a thing."
270,I trust President Trump.  It‚Äôs gonna take time to undo the damage from Biden administration
271,"""SPECTACULAR!"" indeed: spectacularly stupid. A new world record."
272,"I don‚Äôt think the tariffs will impact US products that much.  US is the main market for Canada, Mexico, and China."
273,"For the record, during election campaing, Kamala said it was necessary to increase taxes.  What is the problem?"
274,"All of this is why Putin wanted Trump in office in the first place, and over 77 million of you complied.  

I didn‚Äôt see this coming, said absolutely no one with any sense."
275,NOT SURE WHAT ITEMS WE GET FROM CANADA OR MEXICO BUT I GUESS I DON'T NEED THEM.
276,"All Canada, China and Mexico had to say was, we will try to stop the smuggling of fentynl into U.S."
277,I'll take it more seriously when Canada replaces there government fleet vehicles from suburbans to Range Rovers
278,Any Trump voters want to explain how this is helping make 1 thing you buy any cheaper ?
279,It's a sneaky way to use the working class to finance tax breaks for his billionaire friends who invested so heavily in his inauguration. The money they spent wasn't just for a historic photo op
280,"For everyone that blathered like an idiot here, say it with me.  TRUMP WAS RIGHT."
281,"If Trump and MAGA paid attention in history class, the word Tariffs will never be in their vocabulary. Any of these geniuses know what happened on June 17th, 1930 when Republican led Congress passed and Herbert Hoover signed the Hawley-Smoot Tariffs Act into the law? Maybe these geniuses never heard of the Great Depression that followed."
282,Canada thinks we care..I don't really because look who they pick as leaders!  
283,Welcome to the age of billionaires conning everyone else. ( oligarchy )
284,Let me figure out this Trump logic if we put a 25% tax on Canada Canada has to pay that tax but if Canada puts 100% tariff on us we Canada still has to pay that tax how does that work
285,"Market capitalism will naturally drive prices down.  Competition for customers will drive prices down.  Plus when Trump gets rid of federal income tax, your paycheck will get fatter.  Tariffs on American products don't seem to bother them."
286,The U.S. provides military power and a lot of money to Canada and Mexico. Everything these 2 produce is pretty much attainable elsewhere.
287,"His Tariffs crashed markets....
Typical Dictator move with out understanding the repercussions and consequences.  
Cleary embarrassed himself to his rich friends......"
288,"For change always requires patience and strength .U.S  Democrats only talk but stagnate, no change."
289,Someone tell the Canadians to put their creoles back in because Dominic LeBlanc isn't up to the task.
290,Need that ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù üá∫üá∏ GOLDEN ERA BABY!
291,Mexico and Canada had their chance to control their borders
292,Everybody that wanted trump in the office that‚Äôs what you get
293,"The penny‚Äôs starting to drop that Trump has no idea about economics. All expert economists say it‚Äôs a bad idea, so why is he continuing with this plan? Tariffs were a major cause of the Great Depression in the U.S."
294,Ronald Regan is trying to possess a new body and save Republicans.  How can the president not understand what subsidies are?
295,Now how about offering incentives for Americans to buy American?
296,4 years of complaining about egg prices and now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Silence

322,Anti-tarrif narrative is surface level thinking.
323,Wow this is fun to watch‚Ä¶it‚Äôs called a global economy and it‚Äôs a little late to go back. If it was cheaper to do it in the USA do you not think they‚Äôd be doing it already or are Americans just that bad at business 
324,Tariffs are great! Don't buy foreign goods period. Buy American goods only!
325,I say let‚Äôs see what happens‚Ä¶shake the swamp up and shake up globalism‚Ä¶I‚Äôm for it even if initially things become a little uncomfortable but ultimately lead to long term American prosperity. I‚Äôm for thinking ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù approaches.

Of course we are gonna retaliate and people who criticize us for retaliating should look in the mirror and ask yourself ""wouldn't you if you were Canada""?       So glad you had your back in every war no questions asked.     Helped get your hostages out of Iran.   Always lend a helping hand during any of your disasters?    We're ripping you off lol.

344,"I don't care about the ""culture wars"" or being ""woke"" or any of that stuff heck there's some truth to the backlash against that, but this right here is why I voted against Trump. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of economics could tell that throwing blanket tariffs around is a great way to make consumer prices go up. We already went through the highest inflation in most peoples lifetimes, I'm not in the mood to go through it again."
345,"There is not brand new world, wake up."
346,"Once they go into play the will never go away, and we will pay every bit of it , made in America companies will never lower their prices, the on made in America  washing machines and dryer go up in price supply  and demand , this shows our education system failed to teach people basic economics, Karma"

354,We don't have a problem with the people in either country. Our beef is with the crooked leaders in those countries. Now tell me how many washing machine I need to buy in my life.?  We also need to buy made in U.S whenever possible..These tariffs will replace taxation. The proposals to our northern and southern borders is a good offer. Canada is broke and outraged and Mexico have stopped dancing on their hats.
355,The largest thing US imports from Canada is oil. Buys 300 billion then refines it and sells a bunch back to canada and the rest wherever for 500 billion. If these tarrifs continue for to long canada will finish there pipeline to the west coast and build their own western refinery for heavy crude. US will lose their 200 billion proffit. Plus canada will no longer have to sell at about 10% below market value as they will have alternative markets
356,Love president Donald trump save Americans made in all USA number 1 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
357,"Trumps idea of how Tariffs work..
Eggs are $3,87 a dozen in Canada. 
Canada decides to export eggs to the US for that price. 
Trumps tariff on Canadian imports is 100% 
Therefore Canada pays America $3,77 tax for every dozen eggs in exports to the US at $3,77 per dozen. .
Should work"
358,We‚Äôre in decline and trump is making it worse. He is such a liar.
359,Canada loves spending our money so they can offer dental cleanings. Start following Pierre Poilievre and Danielle Smith to understand what is really going on in Canada
360,Car dealers have a glut of cars on the lot right now and could use a pulse in production to eliminate the back volume anyways.
361,"What is corruption? Yeah, don‚Äôt see it."
362,The cartel marauders are having a field at at the US Mexico border and the Mexican govt is doin nothin.
363,"Well, if you think about it, the first two years of the last administration, what it was like, thirty five forty five hundred dollars a year, so a thousand five hundred more year is better than what we were getting"
364,"When I was young, my fellow Filipinos are so proud to buy and own American products esp clothings and shoes even if it is very expensive. Chinese poor quality imitations destroyed the quality of the original US products."
365,"So prices are set in America by the cost of American manufacturing, even if the price to manufacture in China is pennies on the dollar.  The Chinese make it for 50 cents and sell it for $10 but the American product cost $4 to make and is sold at $12.  These tariffs just will make the corporations less money because if they raise the price to the made in American price then no one will buy the Chinese version."
366,And so the intellectual wars are starting to steamroll regardless!
367,Tariffs will raise goods.. I dont care i won't buy them at all. Make them here or deal with Americans not buying them. These companies make things over seas strictly for profit margins.
368,Market crashing. Inflation back up 10% and more. It's pain but anticipated. We are strong enough to endure this.
369,Vietnam  has so many Avocados for so cheap and good taste
370,"Ok, why cry when you are doing the same thing you counter with your own tariffs? Let's see what would happen "
371,"Wow, criticism from Fox News of Trump ? You know it‚Äôs really bad when they do that."
372,Once coin reigns supreme this cycle and it's XAI308K.. can't wait to see the look on people's faces who didn't invest
373,Big difference we can endure this. It might get worse before it gets better but better as later this year. Not like a lying democrat where it never happens. Be patient people.
374,Oh this poor host is trying so hard to carry water for Trump.  It‚Äôs simply a terrible idea. 
375,These countries already tariff the US heavily. 
376,Trump has been standing up for Americans in the rigut way. Other countries shouldnt be freeloading off America and the generosity of the American taxpayers
377,Tariffs 25%i for 25% ‚Ä¶ $ for $ a powerful move by Canada
378,"Lol, drugs are cheaper. What Canadian or Mexican pharmaceuticals companies are to blame?"
379,"Bring the companies back to the US, there many American companies in Mexico and the people are happy to work for them also Mexico benefits a lot by travelers, Mexico has a lot to lose, why is so hard for them to control the border, simple they don‚Äôt want to do it same with Canada "
380,Buy in USA I don‚Äôt buy nothing from Canada or Mexico so idc America First
381,"More Talkin' Head non-think. The USA imports much of its fuels. Yes, the US has many refineries, BUT those refineries are designed for heavy crude, while much of US production is sweat crude. So, our sweat crude is exported, refined outside the US then imported back. Again, more know nothin' Talkin' Heads."
382,Let MAGA have all the tariff they want please. More tariff. Even the EU.
383,This can be resolved by closing the northern border for a week or two.  See who gives first.
384,I suggest you people watch Reagan's video talking about the damage tariffs cause to the economy and the importance of free trade 
385,This guest is definitely not America first He's money first America way down the list
386,"Made in USA is EXPENSIVE !!!  That is why importing is a business for both parties.
Installing and opening plants and factories last YEARS. And require specialized workers.  You don't have people for that!  You Americans can only work in Walmart and McDonald's. Sorry!"
387,"The only one superpower country in the world, so..with great power comes great responsibility.Then you are  still remain in power for a long time."
388,MAGA: Have the day you deserve!
389,"What does picking a fight with my closest neighbor and ally say about me to the world? Whichever trade and political deal I made in the past was bilateral, and as such can never be the ""fault"" of just one participant. But picking a fight over nonsensical lies with my closest neighbor and ally tells the rest of the world that I should not be picked as a friend. Of course I can coerce and bully all over the place, but at some point that will not work. But do I really want to live like that while all this is going on? Am i really happy and capable of being alone? Maybe, but maybe not. History tells me that I'll fight a lot and die at the end. I could be special though and change all that history thought me. Am I that special?"
390,Why are we picking on our Allies? These things are stupid. So much for cheaper cost of living. And yes he said there WOULD be pain.
391,Yeah baby!  Start buying at our farmers market  USA üá∫üá∏ 
392,"The question should be, who needs who the most. These countries will fail before USA. They are hoping Trump gives up, but they already should know, he won't."
393,Trump!!!! Thank you!

396,beginning of 'golden age' starts now.
397,I have a lot of seeds for vegetables that I could growth in my backyard. Do not need mexico or chinese products. Cars we have enough cars in this country to last an eternity.
398,"For all of those arguing with the tariffs. 

Yes both country citizens will hurt in the short term but imo will be better for long term. For Americans, go to the government census website on trade between US and these countries. We import BILLIONs more than they import from the US and have for years. We are supporting their economy significantly more than they are helping ours. Evening out the balance sheet has to be done at some point. 

You can‚Äôt argue with the discrepancy although I do wish he didn‚Äôt take such a harsh action."

417,"I don't hear very much from Trump‚Äôs ""uneducated followers""! I am sure that if you look at the word ARMAGEDDON I am sure there is are a few letters in that word you might recognise!! "
418,Trade relationships make us stronger not weaker. Short term gains long term losses.

423,"Here we are again - LOSING LOSING LOSING. don is handing the modern world as if it were the early 1800s. Big, blind actions to compensate for a little man..."
424,I think in the end with Tariffs we can get rid of personal income taxes and make America more competitive bringing more industry back to America and exporting more.
425,gotta love how Fox puts lipstick on a pig
426,"Slightly dishonest to blanket the pain , if you need to buy an import a tax may be a pain, buy American and you may pay a higher price and have a better product the pain of security can be rewarding"

467,Impeach & Convict the prezidunce!
468,And he is laughing!
469,That what America was built on
470,"Sure they have, but just against US goods"

472,Does it means that energy exported in the US from Canada to the US will be taxes by 25%. Trudeau will be happy about that. And they want to reopen keystone pipeline
473,No more free trade. Start a new world trade.
474,So trump is president for less then 2 weeks and now produce will cost 25% more and many more items‚Ä¶awesome
475,"Investing is all about the long game. People who want positive results now immediately at this time are fooling themselves. A w2 employee gets paid every 2 weeks and stays broke...someone who works for themselves may not get paid for over a month, but makes way more in the long run. It's same thing here with the tarrifs...it's the long game guys for the much larger pay off"

479,Parody with a chance of goofballs  without such clowns there is no comedy lads
480,Walmart will help us.
481,Make boat loads of money and leave the country is the goal
482,"This is an incredible business opportunity for entrepreneurs. All these goods that are manufactured or produced in other countries because they have cheap labor, can now be produced in the US. There is going to be a big void that can be filled by enterprising Americans. This will create thousands of jobs. Does anyone want a coat, a pair of shoes, an avocado, a cell phone, or a car, so badly that they are willing to have people work in slave like conditions to produce that for them, so they can get it cheaper than an American made product? Yes, prices may go up, but so will income, and our national security will stronger. Does anyone remember the 1973 oil embargo? When OPEC stopped producing oil so they could raise the price, it almost crippled America because we were so dependent on them for energy. We can not let the fate of this country be controlled by other nations that produce products we rely on, that could suddenly cut us off. That is not national security."
483,its ok . il pay more . in the beginning it will be disruption prices will sky rocket . in the end it will level out . GO GET EM MR. TRUMP

494,The people are angry FOX. Very very angry. 
495,"Make things in the usa, buy U.S products...so how much is the average USA employee salary? Unless it is dirt cheap, things wont cost less, but more even in the long run. Or you can tell your boss to pay you less, so the cost of production is less and therefore the selling price might be less. Fingers crossed.

But hey, maybe we'll save in personal taxes"
496,"The US is the paying party here. canada mexico and china are dependent on US imports. if this goes fair and square, US has to win. my money on US"
497,"Here's something crazy... Trump enforces tariffs, paid for by the average Americans, so the billionaires can get a tax cut "
498,"If prices go up people won't buy it, so who suffers? The producers who can't sell thier product that's who.  The money is irrelevant , the industry is important."
499,Hoenig is gaslighting.
500,There's certain regulations that were put in place for these big companies to dispose of their waste rather r it's in the air or water more properly but it cost those companies more money Trump is trying to cut those regulations for them. Even if you don't believe in climate change how does that help the average American they're not going to make products cheaper because they don't have to pay for regulations there just going to make more money

505,Pr√©sident Trump is the smartest for taxes and tariffs ... I mean sure he himself don't pay those things but you all should pay more for quality stuff made in Canada and Mexico

513,Chickens lay eggs and beans grow out back.....get real folks...if you learned how to live you wouldn't have anything to whine about.
514,"I guess if you want us to USA, we Canadians can let China lease military bases in Canada. We may not be very militarily strong, but we're not taking this lying down.

542,"I just want to point out a lot of my fellow farmers made more money in subsides than they lost in tariffs during DJT's  first administration. Guess those of us who voted for him wanted another four years off?? Who's the ""welfare queens"" now?? 

People don't understand that something like 77% of our fresh and frozen vegetables come from Mexico., for example. These price hikes hit our elderly, poor, children and other vulnerable people first and hardest. So much for a ""Christian"" nation. Because if you support this,band claim to be Christian YOU are at ofds with your savior. 
 In the US less than 2% of us are farming. We're on average 65 years old!!!!!! It's almost impossible to stay in farming, even if we're born into it. We can't just spring more farmers out of the ground it's a SKILLED TRADE.  As is ALL of the other tradesmen and our laborers who support the industry. 
If the feed trucks stop coming, cities will be out of food in 72 HOURS.

I am European and I could be scared by such duty increase program, however I do understand the reasons that stand behind it and, most of all, I realize that the old continent has made and keeps making plenty of childish mistakes. I am in the freight forwarding, hence the thermometer of economy: Europe keeps adding mistakes under that respect, mainly based on a self-confident behaviour."
604,Who CARES?
605,Great video guys. I do have one suggestion. Telling the public about XAI308K being best possible crypto project might not be the best idea.

649,It‚Äôs truly insane that anyone still tries to act like Trump is doing a good job. People are literally dying because of his incompetence and now our struggling working class is going to struggle much more. I knew he was going to do horrible things but he‚Äôs far surpassing the level of stupidity I ever thought possible.

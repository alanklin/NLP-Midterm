These mutual tariffs between countries are basically just an extra tax for the consumer btw. You'll pay more for your goods because of the tariffs and the tariff money goes in the government pockets.

Reciprocal negotiated tariffs are called fair trade.  A trade war entails escalating tariffs in an aggressive fashion.  Negotiated trade and a trade war are NOT the same thing.

Tariffs are a tax on American businesses that import goods from foreign nations, collected by the U.S. government, with the revenue going to the U.S. Treasury. The cost of tariffs are passed on to the American consumer in the form of inflation.

‚ÄúWe charge them, they charge us. Very fair. Nobody loses‚Äù.
The people that lose are the ones that need to purchase things that have tariffs put on them.
But, then again, does Trump care about the people who have to pay more?
If even retaliatory tariffs cancel each other, why does Trump feel the need to bully countries with tariffs. Could it be that Trump is counting on using the tariffs revenue that ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù will be paying to cover the tax breaks he‚Äôs giving his rich friends/corporations? Trump is on record saying ‚Äútariffs will pay to lower taxes‚Äù. 
I realize that Trump‚Äôs supporters don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to know that that‚Äôs what is happening. But, what‚Äôs wrong with those who understand what‚Äôs happening but don‚Äôt have the balls to stand up to Trump.  Is everyone waiting for someone else to do something? That‚Äôs what happened in Germany. No one had the balls to stop Hitler and then it was too late.

One of the things that runs counterintuitively is the use of tariffs and how they can improve market efficiency. We are generally taught that tariffs increase costs. Consequently, if one side imposes a tariff, the other side should avoid it altogether. Maybe not. Reciprocal tariffs can encourage equity and, in the long run, lead to a reduction of tariffs altogether.

For example, if I make Product A less well than you and need tariffs to protect my market share, I am overall depriving my society of a better/cheaper version of Product A. If my government protects me via tariffs, the government is essentially abetting this deprivation. A reciprocal tariff can encourage open competition by putting a cost on this undesirable behavior.

Tariffs are not the only means of trade distortion.  For example:  When Japan exports cars to the US, the US will test and certify the class as meeting US standards.  When the US ships cars to Japan, each individual car has to be tested so that it meets Japan's standards.  This adds approximately $10,000 to each vehicle. I could be even more now because I am citing old data.

As a Navy veteran who was stationed in Japan for 2 years, the important and necessity of US-Japan's relation cannot be understated. 

Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines are our biggest allies when in comes to dealing with China and North Korea in that side of the hemisphere.

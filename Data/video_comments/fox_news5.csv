The only reason the US has a trade deficit with Canada is because of oil, which Canada sells to America at a price $15 per barrel less than market value.  This oil helps fuel (pun intended) the US economy at a below market rate.  Removing the value of oil Canada is subsidizing for America’s benefit, 40 million Canadians buy more from America than the 340 million Americans buy from Canada.  Canada’s 40 million also buys more from America than the combined 1,665 million population of China, Mexico, France, and England.  Canada is a huge ally and supporter of the USA.  As for the drugs issue?  There are more illegal drugs flowing into Canada from the US, than the other way around.  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.

Trump has claimed that the U.S. has a “US$200 or $250 billion” trade deficit with Canada. The American government’s own data show that the trade in goods deficit with Canada in 2024 was US$55 billion.
But when you factor in services (in technology or finance), an area in which the U.S. currently enjoys a trade surplus, the annual U.S.-Canada annual trade deficit falls to US$45 billion. And if you exclude energy exports, sold to the U.S. at a discount, the trade scales tip decidedly in favour of the U.S.
Then we also have Trump’s claim that tariffs are needed to penalize Canada for allowing an “invasion” of drugs (mainly fentanyl) and undocumented migrants into the U.S.
But once again, figures from his own government agencies show that only 1.5 per cent of migrants apprehended in 2024, and a mere 0.2 per cent of all fentanyl impounded at U.S. borders in 2024, originated in Canada.  As for Canada not allowing American banks in their country, that's another outright lie. Canada has 16 American banks and their branches operating in Canada.

We are absolutely worried that SSI will no longer be funded under Trump. we'll have to rely on his pension, a 403 (b) and a very prolific lnvestment account with Julie Parisio Roy Services my FA. Our national debt is bloating and expanding every month. Our government needs to get spending under control and cut the federal budget.

Trump inherited a strong economy, with the last years of Obama’s presidency averaging higher GDP growth (2.5%) than Trump’s first three years (2.3%). His major economic moves—imposing tariffs on China and renegotiating trade deals—led to unintended consequences. The tariffs triggered retaliatory measures that hurt American farmers, requiring $28 billion in government bailouts. Meanwhile, his renegotiated trade deals, like the USMCA, ended up being agreements he later criticized. These facts show he didn’t build or significantly grow the economy, but rather disrupted it.

The United States dollar was established as the world's foremost reserve currency by the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. It claimed this status from sterling after the devastation of two world wars and the massive spending of the United Kingdom's gold reserves. Despite all links to gold being severed in 1971, the dollar continues to be the world's foremost reserve currency. Furthermore, the Bretton Woods Agreement also set up the global post-war monetary system by setting up rules, institutions and procedures for conducting international trade and accessing the global capital markets using the U.S. dollar.

I’ve been criticized for questioning tariffs and Gaza policies, but now that even Fox is talking about the risks of tariffs, it tells me something big is coming—and my suspicions weren’t far off. The bigger question is: are we repeating history with these economic moves? We’ve seen it before with Smoot-Hawley in 1929, and history has a way of rhyming. If this keeps up, the fallout could be bigger than most expect. What do you all think—is this the start of something bigger?

Every single economist has called these tariffs completely unnecessary and damaging for everyone, especially America. A US car dealership was interviewed on Fox and he said that an $80K Dodge has now increased in price due to the tariffs, to $100K and it won't sell. Maria Bartiromo who was fronting the show tried to mitigate it by saying that if you go to Europe you won't see people driving Dodge Rams alluding that we are to blame for refusing to buy American cars. She forgot to mention that they a: they won't fit on our roads, b: We can't afford to run them, c: They are poorly made, d: Europe has better quality, cheaper and more fuel efficient vehicles already so why would we buy worse. This is the type of stupid that the rest of the world sees of the current US administration and circus media.

The reason jobs have left this country is because of labor costs.  Its a lot cheaper to make products when you are paying people $2 an hour.

It'll most likely get a little worse before it starts getting better. Imported steel and lumber may go up in price, however local steel mills and lumber companies will begin to ramp up production to fill the demand. This will create jobs here in the U.S. and help our economy. I remember when you could buy many things that were ""Made in the U.S.A."" before all the manufacturing went overseas to Japan.. then Japanese products got more expensive and China became a competitor and took the market.  Fact is that if we don't have the capabilities to produce things here in the U.S., we are vulnerable to supply chain issues and dependent on others. We can look at how much other nations are paying on the joint efforts we're in together and tell how few we can really count on.

I work in fencing. These increases in lumber and steel costs will undoubtedly affect the prices we are able to offer. If this makes customers a bit squeamish at the same time it could be a major issue. That being said the only way to fix the issue over the long term and to close the gap between foreign and American production is to cut the cost of compliance. It’s the cost we impose on ourselves that makes us “uncompetitive”.  So then why the question is, are those other countries able to hold out longer than us. How will this affect them, will they be able to hold steady and force us to change tactics? I know it’s gonna hurt me, it’s gonna hurt us, but what will it do to them and do they have the stomach for it?

no no, I disagree. We will have a lot of choices to pick products which we would like to buy. Of course, no body will be willing to spend more money to buy  expensive stuffs. People will start to buy domestic products for a cheaper price or buy from traders that can provide cheaper options.  The Exporters will have to lower their product prices to equal to the pre=tariffs to find buyers.

If the median house costs 500k the materials should come from the USA. 80k cars should be made in the USA. Recession is necessary to reverse inflation but the government keeps the prices high with stimulus money. Big government is the issue not the solution.

Don't forget the costs of food.  Triple hits, tariff wars, war on migrants, and cut to federal programs supporting agriculture.  Expect inflation to food costs in the 10 to 15 percent.  This will eliminate disposable income for a large part of the American consumers thanks to trickle down economics.  Cuts in consumer spending will tank yhe economy along with the increased costs of all other goods and the.rise in unemployment.

The reason the U.S. economy is struggling is due to the collapse of its manufacturing industry. Factories that formed the backbone of manufacturing, such as those in the automobile, shipbuilding, and heavy chemical industries, were relocated to China. As a result, China became known as the ""world's factory"" and established itself as a manufacturing powerhouse, while the U.S. experienced economic difficulties and rising unemployment due to the decline of its manufacturing sector.

During the 2008 global financial crisis, when the U.S., European countries, and many other nations faced economic turmoil, China emerged as a key player in stabilizing the global economy. As a manufacturing giant, China suffered less damage from the financial crisis compared to other countries. Similarly, Germany, the most economically prosperous and industrially developed country in Europe, also experienced relatively minor setbacks.

As the U.S. economy continued to struggle, nationalist and protectionist sentiments grew stronger, and former President Trump's campaign promise to ""Make America Great Again"" resonated with many Americans.

Btw. When Trump say there’s a trade deficit against EU, it’s incredible narrow way to look at it. If you look at it in isolation then yea, that’s how it is… but there’s a whole tapestry going into it. 

I’d invite everyone to research the service deals and agreements going into it as well, plus the sale of weaponry and arsenal, and you will realize that it’s about more even. Then you’ve to add in all the workforces that it creates all the education it creates and the taxes collected from that. All the stability that it creates and economy really wants stability not uncertainty. So yea.. and Trump probably knows that, but he see that as an easy way to get leverage.. it’s the American people that’s going to pay for it.

There is an increasing demand for the unskilled and highly skilled. That almost eliminates the middle skilled which produced a middle class in America. Big businesses like the big box stores don't need many highly skilled nor middle skilled. Their huge need is for the unskilled and low paying jobs. They have no need for the middle skilled who work in jobs like manufacturing. When manufacturing comes back then the middle skilled jobs will increase and so will the cost of the products they produce. When there were many middle skilled jobs most Americans worked in middle skilled jobs. When those were eliminated Americans went down or they got more training so they could work at higher paying jobs.

Why the U.S. Economy is Struggling: The Collapse of Manufacturing

1. The Decline of Manufacturing and Global Outsourcing

Since the 1980s, the U.S. has increasingly shifted toward a service-based economy, relocating major manufacturing industries like automobiles, shipbuilding, and heavy chemicals to countries such as China and Mexico. This led to job losses and economic stagnation in many industrial regions.

2. The Impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis

The financial crisis, driven by the housing bubble and excessive risk-taking in the financial sector, severely impacted the U.S. economy. In contrast, manufacturing powerhouses like China and Germany suffered less damage, as their economies were more resilient to financial turmoil.

3. China's Rise and America's Relative Decline

China became the ""world’s factory"", gaining economic dominance over global supply chains. With strong industrial policies and technological advancements, China now competes with the U.S. in key sectors such as semiconductors, batteries, and artificial intelligence.

4. The Return of Protectionism and America-First Policies

As economic hardship grew, many Americans felt that their jobs were being outsourced, fueling support for Trump’s ""America First"" agenda. His policies focused on protectionism, anti-China measures, and reshoring manufacturing jobs, which resonated with struggling workers.

5. Efforts to Revive Manufacturing, but Challenges Remain

The Trump administration is also pushing to rebuild key industries like semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy within the U.S. However, high production costs and labor shortages make a full manufacturing revival difficult.

Ultimately, the decline of U.S. manufacturing and China’s rise have created long-term structural challenges for the American economy, leading to growing nationalism and protectionist policies.

Tariffs will cause people to buy US made goods. Keeping that money in the US will greatly help the US economy much more than the increased cost. Buying US will give people jobs here, which will enable them to buy a house, a car, pay more taxes and save for their future. Sending our money to foreign countries will cause US workers to be on welfare - a drain on our economy. It is not all a loss for the US, that is incorrect.

U Americans have no idea how good president Trump is. Remember the golden rules for a great economy: 1.everybody has to work. 2.Low taxes, u can spend ur money waaaaay better than any government official! 3.low amounts of red tape. 4.Selected trade, definitely not ""free"" trade! 5.Balanced government budgets! ps. now Trump has not implemented tariffs like i would: give a year and a half's notice that tariffs are going to be implemented then again i dont have a 36 trillion dollar problem staring at me and i need taxes to pay the money back! American jobs are being lost to overseas because of local taxes(all: environmental, sales, rates etc) pushing local prices above imported prices. Why are overseas prices cheaper than local, look at local taxes, less taxes overseas & overseas subsidies, maybe stolen intellectual property that that they are not paying for.....huge amount of reasons. The point being is that u want fair competition. Tariffs are to be used long term with the aim of equalizing local tax obligations. Unfortunately tariffs also need to be used to ""fine"" other countries, this is very disruptive, and all other avenues need to be considered.

Your ""economic expert"" does not seem to know much about economics.  He refers to ""inflation"" - Milton Friedman said: ""Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,"" meaning it is caused by money supply increase and not simply as price increases of goods and services.  Trump's tariffs are not a monetary issue.
Trump's tariffs will cause price increases but these will not disappear over a few months as the expert seems to indicate.  Factors that cause price increases are lower productivity, higher inventory levels, greater margin demanded for taking business risk, etc.  All of these factors are currently in play, not just in the post tariff US economy ..
These higher prices are now likely to be a permanent feature of the US economy even if the tariffs are reversed.  Business under Trump is riskier than under Biden.  Contraction of the US federal spending will shrink the US economy; foreign demand for US goods will reduce, domestic demand will reduce.  If the federal spending reduction continues at the current pace (Medicare and Medicaid reductions, for example) ... the Elon Musk ""pandemic"" could trigger a global depression.

If you look at Fox News daily reporting, almost nothing is on the front page about the tariffs. This kind of reporting critical of what Trump has done is the rare exception, which most Fox viewers never see and fewer believe (or understand).

I believe that US is not ready for tariffs because it will hurt the consumers in US and outside.  Sounds good but for me is not.  I think US change the regulation for the investors or corporations, so.... to bring back US products and invite to other investors into the country.  As US president or a father in this country ... the people who lost jobs they should have another jobs available for them, so the economy keep going. If many investors invest in US probably US  needs more workers. the hire workers other countries as contract workers.  .

Finally the cheering section at Fox is muted somewhat by a bucket of cold reality. Trump's trade policies have never been a good idea and sadly, he seems unaware of how the economy functions. Hint: it's very complex and interwined with the US's largest partners built up over decades. Simplistic black and white solutions, which seem to dazzle the administration, won't work.

Everybody is worried about the tariffs, quickly forgetting what the president said that there will be a brief period of pain that will be followed by a large influx of American companies coming back here and thus bringing a huge lift to the economy..  .. Have some faith in him. He's done wonderfully so far, in an amazingly short time.

Most people can't afford these over priced new cars anyway! I don't see how it's going to effect that many middle class people! If these manufacturers already have record profit from building in Mexico and still price the cars way to high! Time for the big 3 to start losing some profits and maybe they will learn!

you know  things are bad when fox news reports anything bad about trump
Is it me or is this the first time that Fox is actually criticising Trump's actions?
"""If the Dow drops 1,000 points in two days the President should be impeached"" - Donald J. Trump, November 2012. It's down 1,300 points since Monday."
I'm really surprised that FOX didn't blame Obama for this.
"No matter what party you support Democrat or Republican these tariffs will impact all of  us the consumers, you and your family, not the wealthy politicians, millionaires, or billionaires."
I’m really surprised to see Fox News airing something like this .. an actual real observation that many other economists have stated will be the result of Trumps tariffs
I want to congratulate Fox on not being blind to Trump's trade fiascos
"The only reason the US has a trade deficit with Canada is because of oil, which Canada sells to America at a price $15 per barrel less than market value.  This oil helps fuel (pun intended) the US economy at a below market rate.  Removing the value of oil Canada is subsidizing for America’s benefit, 40 million Canadians buy more from America than the 340 million Americans buy from Canada.  Canada’s 40 million also buys more from America than the combined 1,665 million population of China, Mexico, France, and England.  Canada is a huge ally and supporter of the USA.  As for the drugs issue?  There are more illegal drugs flowing into Canada from the US, than the other way around.  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black."
"If fox is saying this, it should be worrier than we expected"
"P.S. When someone tells you it will get worse before it gets better, and it's just ""short term pain"", remind them that Hoover's ""short term pain"" lasted 25 YEARS until Eisenhower's massive infrastructure and health care spending got us out of the mess."
Finally Fox starts to admit what Trumps does makes no sense.
"Wow someone on Fox telling the Truth. Things must suck,Thanks MAGATS."
"Trump has claimed that the U.S. has a “US$200 or $250 billion” trade deficit with Canada. The American government’s own data show that the trade in goods deficit with Canada in 2024 was US$55 billion.
But when you factor in services (in technology or finance), an area in which the U.S. currently enjoys a trade surplus, the annual U.S.-Canada annual trade deficit falls to US$45 billion. And if you exclude energy exports, sold to the U.S. at a discount, the trade scales tip decidedly in favour of the U.S.
Then we also have Trump’s claim that tariffs are needed to penalize Canada for allowing an “invasion” of drugs (mainly fentanyl) and undocumented migrants into the U.S.
But once again, figures from his own government agencies show that only 1.5 per cent of migrants apprehended in 2024, and a mere 0.2 per cent of all fentanyl impounded at U.S. borders in 2024, originated in Canada.  As for Canada not allowing American banks in their country, that's another outright lie. Canada has 16 American banks and their branches operating in Canada."
"They went from ""We will lower egg prices on Day 1"" to ""build your own chicken coop"" without blinking an eye "
There is no spin on how dumb these tariffs are. The products will find other willing markets while americans will suffer
"All these issues stem from an economy grappling with uncertainties, including housing problems, foreclosures, global fluctuations, and the aftermath of the pandemic, leading to instability. Rising inflation, sluggish growth, and trade disruptions demand urgent attention from all sectors to restore stability and stimulate growth."
Trump will cause a great depression
Well done MAGA! Putin is very proud of you!
Who at fox let this one slip by… someone actually telling the truth.
"More countries are supporting Ukraine:
United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, and many European Union member states including Sweden, Poland and now Turkey. Other nations like Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand."
I don't see the issue. Make enemies of our trading partners all over the world and tariff them. Then they'll tariff us. Then we'll tariff them back. And then they'll tariff us back. This seems like a plan that a man who bankrupted of his own businesses 6 TIMES would come up with. What could go wrong? Solid leadership. Trump baby! 'Merica. 
McKinley-tarrifs-depression. Hoover-tarrifs-depression. Trump-tarrifs-see above. Republicans never learn. Putin laughing.
Why are we picking on our Allies?????
TARIFFS ON - TARIFFS OFF - TARIFFS ON - TARIFFS OFF . He's playing with tariffs like a switch. He's crazy xD
"For MAGA, Trump’s voters should be happy to accept Trump’s inflation."
"Creating a Tariff war, making the cost of living worse for most and cutting 80,000 jobs from the VA does not seem very patriotic to me."
"Canada will not back down, we will deal with the rest of the world not the USA"
"Considering that Fox has so far been willing to spin every Trump idiocy positively, this is remarkable."
"This is the reality for Americans!  
Tariffs are taxes that are added at the consumer end."
Sometimes I think about becoming Amish to escape all this bs. Some peace and quiet would be nice.
"The world doesn't like bullies and toxic or unreliable partners, the relationship with the U.S. has just changed forever. U.S. consumer goods will stay on the shelf everywhere around the world."
Trump negotiated the current trade agreement and called it the greatest deal we could have made.
"Wow Fox telling the truth,"
Finally something sensible comes out of FOX..
"Good on you, Fox Business, for showing the negative impacts with less bias."
Trump promised the cost of things would go down. So far he’s already significantly lowered the price of stocks has gone
Are they finally getting it?  This man bankrupted casinos - how is that possible?
"literally 100% maga merch produced in china.
thoughts?"
Tariffs are a tax on your consumers... not a tax on your opposition. No one wins.
I thought Trump ordered Fox to write positive stories about his clown rally.
"I hope we all know that it doesn't matter who is in the 'top job' because this is a systemic problem -- greed. We have allowed many of our economic sectors, to take advantage of the American people. It's disgusting and frightening for the future of our country. My husband and I will be retiring in the next two years in another country. We are absolutely worried that SSI will no longer be funded under Trump. we'll have to rely on his pension, a 403 (b) and a very prolific lnvestment account with Julie Parisio Roy Services my FA. Our national debt is bloating and expanding every month. Our government needs to get spending under control and cut the federal budget."
"Tariffs on Mexico will increase migration to the US, not reduce it."
He Still doesnt understand what a tariff is. A regressive sales tax.
"There's your master negotiator at work, he's such a loser."
Finally fox news is making sense.
As a  Canadian the hardest product I find to boycott is orange juice. I love it. I guess it’s Canadian made Apple juice from now on.
To think U.S. auto workers voted for Trump is hilarious. They went into the ballet box and put a gun to their head.
"Trump is an ignoramus, and hasn't thought this through."
A clown! Should have left it on 1st April. A fool also on Fool’s Day.
99% of Trump merch made in China
"Is there anything more pathetic than a bully with all the cards (his words) whining and crying about being taken advantage of by his smaller neighbour (and most valuable and trusted partner in trade and security)? Nope, that's about as weak and pathetic as it gets. "
Trump switched to Russia so Fox switched to CNN.
Finally Fox speaking the truth for once
They should have increased the taxes on fast food in America.  We could knock out that deficit in a couple weeks.
"With Trump in power, America needs a safeword. This is economic sadomasochism."
I am shocked Fox News is reporting this
First time I ever clicked like on a Fox video.
Russia has Trump in their pocket
"Hey Europe and Commonwealth family. There are two ways to help Canada, one Boycott all American products and services, that includes Netflix. 

Two, buy something Canadian!"
I have refused to buy a new car for at least five years now. The auto industry needs a reset. 100k for 1 vehicle yeah right...
"The tarriff plan will evidently lead to high inflation, the high inflation is a significant reason why most retirees have sleepless nights. The increase in prices of everyday items puts them at risk of running out of money. As prices rise, the amount of money retirees can withdraw from their retirement savings also increases."
"The Boston Tea Party was a protest against The Tea Act of 1773, which was a  terrif on tea imports."
Wonder if Trump will invoke an executive order to lower the minimum wage.  Won’t that be nice?
"You heard it on FOX BUSINESS! 

About time to tell you the truth."
"Trump inherited a strong economy, with the last years of Obama’s presidency averaging higher GDP growth (2.5%) than Trump’s first three years (2.3%). His major economic moves—imposing tariffs on China and renegotiating trade deals—led to unintended consequences. The tariffs triggered retaliatory measures that hurt American farmers, requiring $28 billion in government bailouts. Meanwhile, his renegotiated trade deals, like the USMCA, ended up being agreements he later criticized. These facts show he didn’t build or significantly grow the economy, but rather disrupted it."
I can’t believe I just watched a Fox News clip and didn’t get pissed off 
This is fox news? Lol something negative about Trump?
"Tariffs = Import Taxes

Additional taxes = Inflation 

Inflation  + Mass workers layoffs = Decrease in consumer spending = Recession 

Recession  + Inflation = Stangnation"
Went in Hobby Lobby the other day.  Everything I looked at was MADE IN CHINA.
"The United States dollar was established as the world's foremost reserve currency by the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. It claimed this status from sterling after the devastation of two world wars and the massive spending of the United Kingdom's gold reserves. Despite all links to gold being severed in 1971, the dollar continues to be the world's foremost reserve currency. Furthermore, the Bretton Woods Agreement also set up the global post-war monetary system by setting up rules, institutions and procedures for conducting international trade and accessing the global capital markets using the U.S. dollar.
europe and others let the world deal in us dollars 
this is going to change
you need to understand what will happen beyond this 2mins of glory"
Does anyone imagine that Trump knows how tariffs work? He appears to suggest that the exporter pays the tariff to the importer?
"“Carnival Barker,”  Tariffs are expensive,  Trade Wars are expensive,  but not being American is priceless. – Canadian Economist 3/5/2025"
"I think Canada should lower the border restrictions and allow disgruntled Americans to move to Canada.  Apparently during Trump's last presidency many Americans made the move however the process is costly and long.  Canada needs to grow our population, and why not with people that share many of our principles and customs."
Fox fox fox.... what are you doing? How dare you ? criticize Trumps actions? Have you finally some balls growing?
"I’ve been criticized for questioning tariffs and Gaza policies, but now that even Fox is talking about the risks of tariffs, it tells me something big is coming—and my suspicions weren’t far off. The bigger question is: are we repeating history with these economic moves? We’ve seen it before with Smoot-Hawley in 1929, and history has a way of rhyming. If this keeps up, the fallout could be bigger than most expect. What do you all think—is this the start of something bigger?"
"it took some economic meltdown, but we finally got some journalism rather than propaganda."
Poor maga they can’t blame Joe Biden anymore 
King Krasnov. He can handle anything so don’t worry
"Trump says that we’ve been getting unfairly tariffed by other countries, but where are the numbers? Google doesn’t seem to have any numbers"
If only American companies would pay a living wage. Will never happen because of GREED!
The US is an import country and increasing prices for imports via tariffs even more is just outright stupid
I stopped by to see if they were going to be honest
"Trump - Everyone in the world has always treated us badly. We’ve always been the victim, poor us.” That’s why the U.S. is a “poor” country?"
Tariffs will cause recession throughout the world
"You voted on him, now you pay the price. And he is only for one month in office. Wait for more. Much more. Stop him, while you have time."
No doubt Trump will blame it on Biden.
"Every single economist has called these tariffs completely unnecessary and damaging for everyone, especially America. A US car dealership was interviewed on Fox and he said that an $80K Dodge has now increased in price due to the tariffs, to $100K and it won't sell. Maria Bartiromo who was fronting the show tried to mitigate it by saying that if you go to Europe you won't see people driving Dodge Rams alluding that we are to blame for refusing to buy American cars. She forgot to mention that they a: they won't fit on our roads, b: We can't afford to run them, c: They are poorly made, d: Europe has better quality, cheaper and more fuel efficient vehicles already so why would we buy worse. This is the type of stupid that the rest of the world sees of the current US administration and circus media."
Canada has agreements with 51 countries and there are no tariffs. There are times when some tariffs make sense. This isn't one of hhem. Our economies are so integrated that the US is hurting themselves as well as their (what use to be) allies. If you want to protect a particular sector than in my view they are appropriate. Bur nor a blanket across the board tariff.
"Thank you for holding Trump accountable. Nothing wrong with being a Republican. I just hate when people don’t have a backbone and idolize Trump. Trump does good things, but his tariff plan is not financially sound."
DIDN’T TRUMP FAIL AT EVERY BUSINESS VENTURE? EVERY BUSINESS!
"There are other countries Canada and Mexico can trade with.  Lesson learned,  we hopefully will not put all our trust and good faith in trading with USA.   TRUST HAS BEEN BROKEN!"
"Thank you, for getting investment back in Europe! Thank you mr Trump"
"I said it and people fought me, 1) tariffs will increase the price of products and making those products in the USA will triple or quadruple the price of those products, so can someone tell how will  the cost of living get lower with these policies????"
Trump will tariff FOX Business channel like never before.
"Gee, someone on Fox who says Trump tariffs are bad. Maybe they should interview Brian Glenn who will say they are the greatest thing ever...and why doesn't Zelensky wear a suit? These are the important questions we need to know!"
If you voted for anyone on the Epstien flight logs please stop trying to tell the rest of us how to live our lives 
"The reason jobs have left this country is because of labor costs.  Its a lot cheaper to make products when you are paying people $2 an hour.  Labor is actually more expensive in Canada, so attacking them makes no sense. We actually need their resources.  Mexico does make sense,  labor is much cheaper.  China makes sense, so  would a lot of other Asian countries like Vietnam and Malaysia."
Thank you FOX for calling this out!
tariffs are a tax on the specific consumers.....money goes into the treasury from the tariffs....Trump will then reduce taxes....soooo.....who pays the tax? The average consumer...who does Trump give the tax break to? stay tuned......
"At least, he will lower the debt  of the country..."
Trump is a doofus! 
"We tend to have a short-sighted approach. It’s not just about inflation—we’re also driving Canada, Mexico, and the EU to consider China as a key economic partner. Meanwhile, many people abroad are starting to move away from purchasing U.S.-made goods. As the saying goes, if we play with fire,  we’re bound to get burned."
"After voting for him, I find myself rooting for Europe and Canada and booing my own country."
We are on our end of days!!! Goodluck to all of us!!! God bless us all...
How does this make sense to run on making things more affordable and implement a bunch of inflationary policies.  Also fentanyl flowing across Canadian US border is not material like 40 pounds vs over 20000 pounds in Mexico border.  Treating Canada the same as Mexico is disrespectful for drug trafficking
"We are already there with high prices, no one can afford to live as it is, where have you been??"
"first there are tariffs, then no tariffs and now more tariffs, then no tariffs."
"I realized that the secret to making a million is saving for a better investment. I invested 30k in crypto and made about $246k, but guess what? I put it all back and traded again and now I am rounding up close to a million."
Are you sorry yet...This tariff war is the dumbest move ever have fun people...
It will be interesting to see how long Trump's supporters stick with him when the cost of living goes up for them. Trudeau thought Canadians would continue to back his horrible climate policies. The support faded quickly when the cost of everything went up.
Trump got a call from the car lobby and caved like a coward 
"Who has the crystal ball that says these other countries will keep their tariffs?
If they have 0%  tariffs then the USA reciprocate with a 0% tariffs. 
It can go up, down or the same."
The sound of crickets and no economists when Biden was in office.
"is anyone talking about what effects the other countries will experience? Loss of sales, unemployment due to no buyers...something says an equilibrium will be found quickly because both sides will want to lessen the pain. Equilibrium."
I am not sure i am watching Fox News.
Getting our own steel and lumber cranked up will take a little time but thats whats best for America long term.
"Tariffs should be targeted to specific industries/sectors where you have local competitors, otherwise is just plain price increase..."
"I am pleasantly surprised. Fox, keep up the good work."
My wallet got chilled 
Home builders are down bc they can’t sell a home to save their lives

"When the riches pockets get effected they freak out, that does not mean the average should view this the same. Wasnt everyone saying trump only cares about the rich"
Just one month of higher car prices? Who are you kidding….
Agent Donald Krasnov the economist:(
"It'll most likely get a little worse before it starts getting better. Imported steel and lumber may go up in price, however local steel mills and lumber companies will begin to ramp up production to fill the demand. This will create jobs here in the U.S. and help our economy. I remember when you could buy many things that were ""Made in the U.S.A."" before all the manufacturing went overseas to Japan.. then Japanese products got more expensive and China became a competitor and took the market.  Fact is that if we don't have the capabilities to produce things here in the U.S., we are vulnerable to supply chain issues and dependent on others. We can look at how much other nations are paying on the joint efforts we're in together and tell how few we can really count on."
"I work in fencing. These increases in lumber and steel costs will undoubtedly affect the prices we are able to offer. If this makes customers a bit squeamish at the same time it could be a major issue. That being said the only way to fix the issue over the long term and to close the gap between foreign and American production is to cut the cost of compliance. It’s the cost we impose on ourselves that makes us “uncompetitive”.  So then why the question is, are those other countries able to hold out longer than us. How will this affect them, will they be able to hold steady and force us to change tactics? I know it’s gonna hurt me, it’s gonna hurt us, but what will it do to them and do they have the stomach for it?"
Economists have been warning of dooms day for the past 20 years and everyone is just fine
Goodbye USA.

Sometimes you have to undergo something unpleasant to get a good outcome. How about our trading partners get rid of their tariffs
When the economists is wrong will he be fired
"Tariffs are a sales tax on Americans, Trump is raising taxes “without raising taxes” on Americans…"
"no no, I disagree. We will have a lot of choices to pick products which we would like to buy. Of course, no body will be willing to spend more money to buy  expensive stuffs. People will start to buy domestic products for a cheaper price or buy from traders that can provide cheaper options.  The Exporters will have to lower their product prices to equal to the pre=tariffs to find buyers."
why the heck are these weird avatars always here
The failed real estate developer and jack of all trades knows what’s better for the U.S.  economy than thousands of economists
"But Trump said he doesn’t need Canadian lumber, energy etc. good luck America."
"So, a boycott of U.S. products is, no sales, no tarriffs! I'll do that!"
"I live in Oregon, been working in mills for over a decade. There’s plenty of lumber in Oregon to go around, heard Alaska is going to increase lumber production as well"

We will tariff right back🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
This sounds like it's going to cause insane amounts of inflation... This could be a nightmare for our country for a while 
Great to hear a Fox presentation actually telling it like it is.
"The USA should take the tariffs off, they should give consequences to industries going abroad if the goal is to keep jobs home. What Trump is doing now is punching his allies in the face and getting surprised from the punch he gets back"
Thanks Fox News for tell like it is
He's a simpleton who doesn't understand how tariffs work.
I wonder if all these YouTube conservative podcasters have seen this video. All of them are defending Trump by saying he’s just being strategic lol. Clearly this tariff plan is just not smart.
What crab Trump talking his American people are suffering the prices had gone up soon we hope you all will kick out
JD is going to end worse than pence
"um, you all voted for it over there (well, a majority did anyway), so, either educate those MAGA or suck it up..."
Yes it’s a freaking nightmare.  Impulsive moves are punished.  This wasn’t thought out well at all.
"So T is causing the most unfathomable for businesses and industries right now.  Threaten Tariffs and the delay or minimize and then threaten again and delay and then threaten again and delay.  How can any responsible business reporter not be calling him out for this!?!?  It is sending stocks in free fall, nobody knows what to expect or how to manage their businesses at all!  As a businessman himself, T should know this is disastrous, irresponsible and to say he is a master negotiator?  You gottabekiddinme!!!"
Tariffs are an act of war. To think they are anything less than is extremely naive. Canada and other countries targeted by American tariffs must respond accordingly.
It's about time FOX steps up and defends the truth for the American people. Tariffs hurt everyone but none more than working people.
Tariffs will only hurt consumer spendings. We've all been there before. It doesn't solve anything...
Even FOX news says this is bad.
"Tariffs are a bad idea. Hoover caused the Great Depression with tariffs of 1930. The stock market crash of 1929 started a recession for sure. The 1930 tariff turned that into a deep, dark depression that lasted 10 years."
Americans did not vote for hyperinflation.
The whole world gets it but trump doesn't howbis this even happening?
"What happened? Fox investors multi-millionaires and GOP donors are losing money in the market, so they suddenly got the spine to ""tell it as it is"" ?  "
Finally someone with a spine being honest on Fox News 
"Regardless of what happens with Tariffs, the damage is already done. Canada is developing trade relationships with partners that can be trusted. The impact on the economy will be long term."
I think loosing your standing in the world is way more damaging in the long run. Even if tariffs are lifted the US will not be trusted by anyone again. Siding with Russia is also going to hurt your standing in the world.
"No way, Fox turned Fox on Trump "
What a stupid thing to do. Even Ferris Bueller’s teacher knew that tariffs didn’t work because they had been done before! Anyone anyone?
Murdoch should close Fox News and save a few dollars and transmit RT (Russia) news - the rhetoric is almost the same now
Fox News has no choice  Trump is a disaster. But hey DEI is gone 
Trump should be put in charge of Fragle Rock.
and let me guess....suddenly its the other countries fault that prices rise...
Yall tired of winning yet? lol
The us people should be ashamed of yourselves....so sad
"Furthermore, I'm pretty sure the US loves scooping up all our used trucks and other merchandise at 30% discount on their greenback Lol. Who's getting rip off here when it drives the  price up for us Canadians due to low inventory. Let's talk facts shall we?"
The American and Canadian economies are so integrated that trying to untangle them will be like trying to separate flysh*t from pepper.
US bullying is over. Deeply weak performance by Trump.
"Trump is like a sleazy old car salesman, and he is a bad one decides according to the buyer 
I began to feel sorry for Americans"
Donald ‘stormy’ trump just heard the word reciprocal while watching Peppa Pig and can’t stop using it…he loves it bigley.
Someone at Fox got definitely got fired for this one
My child runs her lemonade stand with more business acumen than the Orange Doofus!
Is Trump the only guy in the world who doesnt know the negative effect of tarifs and tradewar?
"He is a fool every day, week, month, year."
"As a Canadian, I was on board with Trump now I realize he is in fact the half wit that a lot of people made him out to be."

"Good for Joly for saying we are not going to go through this 'delaying again' every 30 days. Delaying is one of Trump's 'tactics' but in Canada, our people have 'balls' and will not back down from Trump's crap. We want zero tariffs (just like it has been)."
You can't mess with billionaire's profits!  Faux news is concerned!

People are saying, ‘Sir, I lost my job, my house, my savings.’ And I say, no mortgage, no problem! Very efficient. The stock market? Just a big sale! Everything’s cheaper—thank me later! The elites didn’t see it coming, but I did. And now? I’m gonna fix it. Because nobody does depressions like me. Believe me."""
Wow. Fox news telling the truth?! What happened?
Higher prices and job losses for regular folks.  Great.
"Please don't have this guest on again. He does not say things that reinforce my current beliefs. I'm looking for affirmation, not education."
Once tariffs fail 3rd time it’s the end of MAGA vision because this is all they had for America
These tariffs will hurt most Americans and playing games with them is very irresponsible.
"Let’s call this what it really is - a new national sales tax. This means that a working person will proportionally pay more tax while the wealthy, with all of the loopholes, will pay less."
Trump is eligible to join Cirque du Soleil (Canadian) for his perfectly executed backflips.
So what they’re trying to say for practical means is that all of us that own 401(k)s will see a major drop like we did during Covid. And it will take five years for those retirement funds to gain and come back to normal. I’m about done with it Because some of us work hard to gain a little bit so we can retire.
I'm a pro trump canadian. But what trump has done with these tariffs he had shaken canada and now Canadians are boycotting American goods. Alot of American business will feel the pain of this decision for years to come.
Good thing I've been getting myself accustomed to eating rice and beans once a day and filtering rain water. Should be fine.
Business abhors uncertainty. And now Trumpf generously offers them the certainty of uncertainty
Tariffs are not the way to make life better in the united states by making all goods 10x more expensive

Please tariff everything I want to pay 12 dollars for an avocado
Foxycontin won’t help you now. Special k won’t save you.Karma is at your door…he who bites the hand that feeds him will lick the boot that kicks him.The world beyond shame is a wasteland of lost souls.
I have a stock portfolio both in the US and EU. For the first time in 4 years my portfolio is actually climbing. The languish is over. Tariffs work when applied in a fair manor and the US has been ripped off for a long time!
The US empire is in its final years and DJT is here to add the final nail to its coffin. RIP. MANA Make America Native Again
"When even fox says the tariffs are dumb, you know its brutally dumb"
"Also, Canada has social safety nets to protect its most vulnerable citizens. Americans living hand-to-mouth, which is why most Americans don’t have the capital to ride out this completely unnecessary storm."
It's almost like a business man that's gone bankrupt 6 times has no idea what he's doing
"Who would have guessed that a 6 times bankrupt ""business man"" would make terrible economic decisions"
Every day is April Fools’ day in Trumps White House.
Reciprocal tariffs makes sense. 25% across the board with Canada and Mexico is ridiculous.
"Trump was the engineer of USMCA, and called it the greatest deal ever. now he says that agreement is no good?"
Tariffs. The republican party. It's unbelievable. Was Reagan really this easily forgotten?
What the heck - this was told to the country last year - his policies would ruin our economy and they sure are - trump can lead anything legitimately - shame on everyone who heard this and voted for him anyway
"Tariffs that save jobs in the steel industry mean higher steel prices, which in turn means fewer sales of American steel products around the world and losses of far more jobs than are saved.

Thomas Sowell"
Props to Fox for actually criticizing the president.
Our country is already in a recession and many Americans don’t even know it.
"Tariffs are good, he is also bringing back Jobs to the US.

The US can supply everything they want themselves.

Remember during Trumps first term, dictator Trudeau put the carbon tax and the US got alot of canadian business."
Dude even without the tariffs car prices are out of control. That's why no one is buying them. Tariffs won't help them sell more cars.......
It's really funny to see how Americans are eating trumps sheet and claiming that this is candy
Why doesn't the US abide by its own contracts  ? who would believe any new deal would be honored
Even Fox is telling us Trump's grievance economic policies are stupid.
Shame America is not far to the rest of the world Don’t need more than brain cells to see this is going to come crushing down on USA
"Once, President Ronald Regan called Libyan President Gaddafi "" The Mad dog of Libya"" . If Regan were alive today, he would have redirected his comment to CEO of America, Mr. Donald Trump; saying, ""The Mad Dog of America has got Tariff-infection""."
"Trump doesn't think, understand or care.Hes a bully toddler in a sand box"
"2020= We're in this together, 2024= Every man for himself, 2025= How much??"
As a Canadian I agree with him stopping the war in Ukraine. But to tariff Canada in oil? Makes zero sense.
"Oh, and now they’re paused again for a month. See you again in 30 days for more of this stupidity folks."
"I believe Trump said that should be fair like fish to fish, cow to cow, but again the country is not ready for that because we have high cost of food and others or inflation. I think there is another way the US will be back as the great nation that nobody hurt."
Why would you let a clown to ruin your country? Despicable coming from an American president.
"Unless these Tariffs are revoked, we would be back in 2008!"
Vladimir Trump 🇷🇺
"Fox viewers, Maga people THIS IS YOUR PRESIDENT IN ACTION!"
"They get the raw materials for 'cheaper' from these places, tariffs help level the local source price. Let us recycle and make our own materials instead of shipping the materials to places like China to be shipped back to use as new. I suppose people will say 'Americans don't want those jobs', meanwhile small towns all over the US are poor run down places."
"Can’t deny the facts, after you’ve been slapped a 1 billion dollar settlement"
WHY HAS THE MEDIA NOT COVERED THE TARIFFS CANADA HAS ON THE US FOR DECADES??????
"If the current US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) is ""unfair"", blame the guy who negotiated and signed it: Donald Trump."
Imagine causing prices to increase like this while at the same time worrying about things like renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America....and you have the audacity to call yourself the best president
Bro really said since the last president 
I'm convinced thump is scoring own goals but some Americans don't see it  yet.
Trump is getting punked by Canada 🇨🇦 and Mexico 🇲🇽 where he is now pausing and retreating back with tariffs like the ultimate looser he is 
"The trade agreement of 2020 was on Trump's watch, do tell us what has changed. It was agreed to by all parties."
These financial experts get paid to say crap like this .
"The one thing I may argue, or question, is the statement that prices will go back down. If they do go back down, it will not be at the same rate as was the increase, I am sure."
Shut the power off! Can't have an economy without electricity or oil
In Europa we don’t buy US products….no Whisky…no Tesla ( minus 60%)….it’s on going 
I'm kinda surprised to see this.  However if we see Maria Bartiromo start saying negative things about Trump...then you'll know it's really bad.
WHAT! fox is critical of Trump? That's crazy.
"He craps on the trade agreement he negotiated with Mexico and Canada. 

The “great negotiator” failed."
"Will Congress take BACk the power of tariff. It properly lies there, not in the hands of a president prone to tantrums."
"""Whatever they tax us, we will tax them."" That's exactly what Canada is doing, responding to Trump's 25% tariffs with 25% tariffs of their own. The U.S. is the unfair trade partner trying to take advantage of people in this scenario, not Canada."
"Our company just reconsidered construction plans for two factories which were supposed to be built in the US. The plans were changed one week ago and the investments will now take place in Vietnam instead, don´t understand the latter but I am not member of the board. It´s a 2.3 billion dollar investment  and just a drop in the ocean, still sad to see this happening."
"Trump uses the stock market as a gauge of his success, we can call it a fat failure."
If the median house costs 500k the materials should come from the USA. 80k cars should be made in the USA. Recession is necessary to reverse inflation but the government keeps the prices high with stimulus money. Big government is the issue not the solution.
"This ""man"" says ""things arent fair"" more than children do."
Fox should praise Trump not criticized
"Congrats to all Trump voters.
Congrats to all newly unemployed Trump voters.
Congrats to all FARMERS who voted for Trump.
ENJOY!!!!!"
"I voted for Trump to root out Wokeness and DEI, but this is getting out of hand.  The betrayal of Ukraine and our Nato allies, the elon disaster is too much"
EVERYONE complained how bad biden was Trump is worse!!!!
We have seen time and time again these so called experts don’t know what they are talking about
"Fox news views actually make me root for the tornados, floods, and hurricanes that are gonna decimate rural America this summer. Just remember, President Musk thinks your a waste of taxpayers money, because you ARE."
"They way he talks about reciprocal tariffs, he's trying to make it sound like the other countries initiated these actions and he's just responding. He's always finding away to put the blame on someone else."
"Well, it's not like anyone in construction voted for trump."
Everyday is April fools day with Trump in the White House.
There is no worse enemy than a friend betrayed
"can't imagine 2 person  behind this whole massacre. Whatever, American will suffer.trump shouldn’t have been in the presidential chair"
"Good plan - cut taxes for the rich and raise taxes for everyone else and call them tariffs 🫣Then blame the countries who are charging these taxes, I mean tariffs for the hard times that will result from these tariffs . FAFO"
"Heads up America.  Tariffs will hurst you more than other countries.  Currencies have already fallen for trading partners, that make it cheaper to buy foreign products.  Companies aren't going to move the  USA.  Other countries are collectively bigger and more profitable."
Trump's chaos will continue every day for the next four years and beyond. What a MESS!
"The result of these tariffs should be, bringing more of these industries back to the US so that we can we can become an exporter instead of an importer, we used to make steel here, we used to make Lumber here"
"Think about it. The captain is putting the ship ON THE ROCKS mates!! Every man for himself.
Seriously. Bankruptcy is an M.O."
"Don't forget the costs of food.  Triple hits, tariff wars, war on migrants, and cut to federal programs supporting agriculture.  Expect inflation to food costs in the 10 to 15 percent.  This will eliminate disposable income for a large part of the American consumers thanks to trickle down economics.  Cuts in consumer spending will tank yhe economy along with the increased costs of all other goods and the.rise in unemployment."
Only the poor will really suffer from trump action not any who is on tv telling you nothing will happen because they are rich
Americans consume 140 rolls of toilet paper per year. This makes them the largest consumer of toilet paper in the world. And 50% of this toilet paper is exported from Canada.
Donald Trump working on making life more difficult for millions of people all around the world. Nice work Donald Trump.
Just because I support Trump doesn't mean i have to love   EVERYTHING the man does.
"Never have prices come back to the level before tariffs. Manufacturers and traders will see to that. After all, if they keep them high, it adds to their profits - which pleases shareholders."
He imposed  tariffs  then call them receptacle what a joke
"Trump promised 350B for mineral deal, UA got 300B of Russian cash for free!  Middle finger to you Donald."
Common sense trump is the one who's treating Canada 🇨🇦 and Mexico 🇲🇽  what the heck
Praying for our Country…. we were warned and prices are soaring still🇺🇸
Why should we be taxed and not other countries?  Just needs to be fair.
The end game is what matters.  You don't have to buy an import.  The results will bring manufacturing back to the US. So it makes sense.
what the heck is trump thinking...
Lose jobs like you have never seen before....
"Similarly it hurt all exporting countries to USA. And that's the idea, until they drop their tariffs. Let's level the playing field"
If only someone had told you Trump would be a disaster.
"Why you people shocked! You voted for this, he literally said he would do this during his campaign."
"If FOX says this, you're going to be really pissed off...."
"The reason the U.S. economy is struggling is due to the collapse of its manufacturing industry. Factories that formed the backbone of manufacturing, such as those in the automobile, shipbuilding, and heavy chemical industries, were relocated to China. As a result, China became known as the ""world's factory"" and established itself as a manufacturing powerhouse, while the U.S. experienced economic difficulties and rising unemployment due to the decline of its manufacturing sector.

During the 2008 global financial crisis, when the U.S., European countries, and many other nations faced economic turmoil, China emerged as a key player in stabilizing the global economy. As a manufacturing giant, China suffered less damage from the financial crisis compared to other countries. Similarly, Germany, the most economically prosperous and industrially developed country in Europe, also experienced relatively minor setbacks.

As the U.S. economy continued to struggle, nationalist and protectionist sentiments grew stronger, and former President Trump's campaign promise to ""Make America Great Again"" resonated with many Americans."

"This has nothing to do with drugs or trade imbalance and everything to do about annexation of Canada for it's oil, water and rare earth minerals and national security to join the main land with Alaska and Greenland."

The billionaires have their money set on decline already. Ask why.
Trump has just renamed April 2nd to April Fools Day.
"Im not usually a fan of fox, but this time they got it right."
"Next, Trump will levy a 1000% tariff on Canadian coconuts. That'll show 'em."
Why not just state that America is closed for global trade and business. Because the rest of the world is viewing this position and they are going to work without American trade and trade amongst themselves. If you wished for an alternative currency nothing could promote the BRICS more so than the position that Trump has chosen as of now. This will advance the future of BRICS. And the stock market is going to show that result.
"What a clown. Tariffs are ok for other countries, but not for the US. Get real."
Let's watch those grocery prices climb now. And everything else.
How many times does Fox News have to be told tariffs will increase prices and inflation.
"Trump and Musk are both geniuses. They will make America great again. Only the ultra rich will be able to afford to survive in the US, but it will be great."
I hope the USA does not survive Trump.
"Fox usually doesn’t slam Trump but at the moment it’s gotten extremely hard for anyone to say anything good about what he’s done and doing, I’d say it’s getting pretty close to the point where he should be legally removed from office before he destroys the American economy and goes down as the worst president in American history."
Now watch the US economy start to slow down.
"A pathetic guy, but he considers himself Julius Caesar. Phew! "
"Thinking about the silly post showing Trump in a crown makes me think about a warning on 4000 year old Babylonian tablet: A king will die, a nation will fall."
He can’t beat her!! He keeps flip-flopping on it! 
"People will stop buying prices will drop, American production will ramp up. Filthy rich people will pull there money out of foreign investments and put it back in America. There will be growing pains………"
MAGA - Make America Go Asinine 
"Btw. When Trump say there’s a trade deficit against EU, it’s incredible narrow way to look at it. If you look at it in isolation then yea, that’s how it is… but there’s a whole tapestry going into it. 

I’d invite everyone to research the service deals and agreements going into it as well, plus the sale of weaponry and arsenal, and you will realize that it’s about more even. Then you’ve to add in all the workforces that it creates all the education it creates and the taxes collected from that. All the stability that it creates and economy really wants stability not uncertainty. So yea.. and Trump probably knows that, but he see that as an easy way to get leverage.. it’s the American people that’s going to pay for it."
"So if the other countries don’t have tariffs on US goods, the US won’t have tarriffs on them? Sounds great!!!"
There is an increasing demand for the unskilled and highly skilled. That almost eliminates the middle skilled which produced a middle class in America. Big businesses like the big box stores don't need many highly skilled nor middle skilled. Their huge need is for the unskilled and low paying jobs. They have no need for the middle skilled who work in jobs like manufacturing. When manufacturing comes back then the middle skilled jobs will increase and so will the cost of the products they produce. When there were many middle skilled jobs most Americans worked in middle skilled jobs. When those were eliminated Americans went down or they got more training so they could work at higher paying jobs.
Great Job Donald. My EU stocks are up and I sold all my US stock on election results day. Carry on the good work £££££
Thank god trump wasnt president in the 40s
"What? You mean that going into a trade war with our trade partners is bad for the economy??
Shocker."
"Well let’s see what is wrong with the economy. $37 Trillion in debt, taxes increase to pay the budget plus over $1 trillion in interest and it becomes cheaper to move industry overseas.  now all he does get criticized by ppl who have no idea how to bring industry back. "
"dont let fox off the hook either, they love and back up trump and his lies."
FOX a USSR affiliate for the USSA .  Never forget.
But Trump is so smart… trust the process. You guys should have your press passes taken for not believing in our dictator.
"When you push the bill off that one time,  you see who your friends really are.  Seems they are only around for the free shrimp and prime rib."
Politicians on both sides works for their constituents and they are blind!!! Trump
I used to support Trump. Now that seeing him trying to annex Canada and wanting to cause a Maga Depression. I want to wish all Americans good luck. I regret this and won’t blindly follow him.
Look at the two clueless poodles behind the dodo……
What a joke of a President. Today he tells Canada to drop all tariffs in order to have the USA drop a few tariffs. Is “reciprocal” a word too big for him to understand? Or is he just a hypocrite? Or will he tariff today and not tomorrow? And what? He forgot that he tariffed yesterday? Totally Gong Show in the US now.
Trump has completely lost the plot with these tariffs. He doesn’t understand them and this constant on and off is driving allies and business partners away whilst tanking the markets 
They usually BLAME BIDEN.
"He was up to a good cause, now he's gone mad with power."
Finally they get it. About time.
Duh. Tariffs are a tax on the middle class.
"I'm going with Trump right now, but he is not having a positive economic impact, yet. In fact, prices keep going higher and the stock market is going lower. Europe's market is booming. This needs to turn around soon or he will go down like a Musk rocket ship. It's the economy. That's the #1 reason we voted for him."
but who is paying the tax money 
"As long as the tariffs are reciprocal, I am for it - not one cent over.  But, I am open to hearing the reasons - though I doubt they'll be anything more that ""poor, pitiful me"" excuses by other countries. Business is not supposed to be charity ."
It's nauseating watching this felon president spew lie after lie! and to think that this is just the beginning.
"Why the U.S. Economy is Struggling: The Collapse of Manufacturing

1. The Decline of Manufacturing and Global Outsourcing

Since the 1980s, the U.S. has increasingly shifted toward a service-based economy, relocating major manufacturing industries like automobiles, shipbuilding, and heavy chemicals to countries such as China and Mexico. This led to job losses and economic stagnation in many industrial regions.

2. The Impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis

The financial crisis, driven by the housing bubble and excessive risk-taking in the financial sector, severely impacted the U.S. economy. In contrast, manufacturing powerhouses like China and Germany suffered less damage, as their economies were more resilient to financial turmoil.

3. China's Rise and America's Relative Decline

China became the ""world’s factory"", gaining economic dominance over global supply chains. With strong industrial policies and technological advancements, China now competes with the U.S. in key sectors such as semiconductors, batteries, and artificial intelligence.

4. The Return of Protectionism and America-First Policies

As economic hardship grew, many Americans felt that their jobs were being outsourced, fueling support for Trump’s ""America First"" agenda. His policies focused on protectionism, anti-China measures, and reshoring manufacturing jobs, which resonated with struggling workers.

5. Efforts to Revive Manufacturing, but Challenges Remain

The Trump administration is also pushing to rebuild key industries like semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy within the U.S. However, high production costs and labor shortages make a full manufacturing revival difficult.

Ultimately, the decline of U.S. manufacturing and China’s rise have created long-term structural challenges for the American economy, leading to growing nationalism and protectionist policies."

Inflation up and prices up... it doesn't take Trump's MIT uncle to figure out the results.
Didn't Trump watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
WHO SIGNED NAFTA.....THE GREATEST DEAL EVER
What you are not realizing is that this will bring business back to the U.S.  Look how many companies are bringing their investments.
Uhhh oooh Donny. I guess he forgot to put his thinking cap on. Man he's a stable genius.
Thanks fox for being honest for change.
Does anyone know where to find information on how much tariffs Canada impose on US before this thing started?
The billionaires will be fine in a tariff trade war. The rest of us?  Prepare to spend more for your family survival. You can thank Trump too.
What I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw this title under a Fox News Videos
Trump is playing yoyo. Businesses need stability not chaos. Thanks Trump for tanking the market and reigniting inflation
"Tariffs will cause people to buy US made goods. Keeping that money in the US will greatly help the US economy much more than the increased cost. Buying US will give people jobs here, which will enable them to buy a house, a car, pay more taxes and save for their future. Sending our money to foreign countries will cause US workers to be on welfare - a drain on our economy. It is not all a loss for the US, that is incorrect."
President Trump is poised to be the greatest financial genius of all time 
It’s so refreshing to see Fox News. Just tell it how it is either way. But just tell the truth I think that more people would watch if they just stuck to the facts.
This clown is the one who negotiated the USMCA and said it was the greatest trade deal ever and now he's complaining about the very deal he approved. He acts like he didn't have anything to do with it. What a knucklehead!
These predictions were there before he was elected. Everyone and their mother saw this coming
It's time for Congress to help Trump find his head
I guess Rubert Murdoch is tired of seeing his billions slip away in the stock market day by day! thanks Rubert....now lets see if Trump can find any media that can support his tariffs
World is full of economists.  They have made it their life to study and analyze this stuff.  Therefore you’d think we’d have a handle on the economy.  They seem to guess at outcomes as if they were at the roulette table. Good luck trying to find a few of them to agree with each other.
Impeach Trumps ASAP
Trump will always be perceived as a sick joke regardless of date.
"SPY is flouting with the 200 SMA. Buffets was smart again with his prescient move.

It’s obvious that premier trump doesn’t know what he is doing .
These are lifetime boycotts against 🇺🇸 from rest 
Too bad the viewers on regular fox network will never get to see this
"Ok enough already stop with the back and forth with the tariffs!!! Obviously your president knows it's a bad idea and trying to find a way out without admitting he screwed up with this decision to  rip up the signed agreement that he negotiated himself in 2018 ! Which he thought was a fantastic trade deal, the best ever in his words!"
"First time ever that I have given a ""thumbs up"" to anything from ""Fox"" propaganda."
Canada's Trudeau humiliates 'cowardly' Trump ...
"The guys are saying inflation, i totally agree. However thats the only thing they looking at. What they not looking at is long term, America is going to benefit massively! Huge! If i was an American i would start producing items like yesterday! If i cant produce I would be buying shares like crazy in manufacturing industries. U Americans have no idea how good president Trump is. Remember the golden rules for a great economy: 1.everybody has to work. 2.Low taxes, u can spend ur money waaaaay better than any government official! 3.low amounts of red tape. 4.Selected trade, definitely not ""free"" trade! 5.Balanced government budgets! ps. now Trump has not implemented tariffs like i would: give a year and a half's notice that tariffs are going to be implemented then again i dont have a 36 trillion dollar problem staring at me and i need taxes to pay the money back! American jobs are being lost to overseas because of local taxes(all: environmental, sales, rates etc) pushing local prices above imported prices. Why are overseas prices cheaper than local, look at local taxes, less taxes overseas & overseas subsidies, maybe stolen intellectual property that that they are not paying for.....huge amount of reasons. The point being is that u want fair competition. Tariffs are to be used long term with the aim of equalizing local tax obligations. Unfortunately tariffs also need to be used to ""fine"" other countries, this is very disruptive, and all other avenues need to be considered."
is Fox news actually waking up to the damage this new Admin is doing and will continue to do to the people who voted for him?  Hope so
"On top of all the statements regarding the purchase power of Canadians of US goods, the investment in US stocks from Canadians and their governments are substantial."

There might be hope it FOX citizens Trump. My faith in human nature is being restored
"They were as ""gentle"" as they could be."
"End game will be resetting the ratio that the US is losing money on Canada. And the hope to bring auto jobs back to America from everywhere. End result will be good, but the journey will likely be hard."
Oh my god. Fox news finally facing the truth. There is still some hope.... You have a president who does not havy any idea about how the economy works.
"Trump pulls out of tariffs, in a blink of an eye"
Who was the dummy that negotiated the last deal with Canada and Mexico?
ALMOST LIKE WEVE BEEN TRYING TO WARN YOU FOR MONTHS SINCE TRUMP STARTED SPOUTING THIS NONSENSE AGAIN.
Thanks Fox Telling the Truth! I hope United States Americans understand this now.  From Canada
But Trump will blame someone/thing else and he knows his voters will just agree with him.
Trump: economic illiterate. Madness.
You know it's bad when even Fox starts speaking like this 
How many bankruptcies has the financial genius Trump made.
Why not on April Fool’s Day ?
Adjusting all these chances back and forth is extrenely time consuming and expensive for all parties involved. There’s a whole framework active behind the ‘fancy’ word ‘’tarriff’. Thats not cheap either.
Wow FOX?? Talking bad about TRUMP???  TRUMP IS A CLOWN
That guy is never being invited again to fox propoganda.
Do not buy a car now!!! wow!! That's going to help the industry!
Trump is a madman while Vance is a fool.
I agree. Tariffs should be reciprocal.
"Your ""economic expert"" does not seem to know much about economics.  He refers to ""inflation"" - Milton Friedman said: ""Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,"" meaning it is caused by money supply increase and not simply as price increases of goods and services.  Trump's tariffs are not a monetary issue.
Trump's tariffs will cause price increases but these will not disappear over a few months as the expert seems to indicate.  Factors that cause price increases are lower productivity, higher inventory levels, greater margin demanded for taking business risk, etc.  All of these factors are currently in play, not just in the post tariff US economy ..
These higher prices are now likely to be a permanent feature of the US economy even if the tariffs are reversed.  Business under Trump is riskier than under Biden.  Contraction of the US federal spending will shrink the US economy; foreign demand for US goods will reduce, domestic demand will reduce.  If the federal spending reduction continues at the current pace (Medicare and Medicaid reductions, for example) ... the Elon Musk ""pandemic"" could trigger a global depression."
You started the tariffs Mr Trump.
DOGE BAGS = lard trump and Elmer Fudd musk.

Playing with tariffs is a terrible negotiating strategy
"He's going to wreck the economy, but maybe that's the plan, a weakened country may be easier to manipulate for other purposes."

Thought Trump didn’t start wars? Very one sided look at economics.

Turn about is fair play. Ye of little faith. I trust President Trump!! ️️🇺🇸
US started tariffs in 1789.
Same economist who think it’s smart to print more then the country makes?
The other countries will cave it will be difficult for a little while and he said reciprocal tariffs who would be opposed to treating other countries the way they are treating us
What an absolute muppet Trump is.
Well. The Fox News haters don’t watch much. Trump is criticized on there regularly. WSJ not exactly a fan lately either. It’s a negotiating tactic. It may work. They may call your bluff.
April Fools is exactly what trumps tariffs plans are 
It really cringe to see all those sycophants cheering this madness on
"¿Un Tratado con Trompo?  ¡Jajajuajuar!
A Treaty with the orange wacko tRump?  Haha!  He does not respect treaties,"
"Let’s wait & see, The President is doing great. "
"Stop complaining, you caused this for no reason. And you voted for him, not our problem. The great leader, lmfao."
"So far the great American deal maker hasn’t made a deal worth talking about. His deals have been laughable. Funny to watch Vance and the idiot speaker sit there and clap and smile, fully knowing they have to or trump will have them removed."
Why doesn't Canada drop all their tariffs?
Im still waiting on no tax for overtime
"Trump was enjoying historical support and approval so far, but these tariff shenanigans might bring down his approval fast. The whole tariff business was so stupid, seems like he expected Canada and Mexico to bend over, and when they didn't, it began backfiring spectacularly."
Funny how Trump didn't mention any of this stuff before he got elected funny Fox News is the one telling this to people now I guess I'll ever viewers are going to call Fox a rhino
Is this the 4D chess genius you've been talking about?
"Wow, fox is actually reporting news"
We need a steady hand on the tiller. No more zig zagging
"I believe that US is not ready for tariffs because it will hurt the consumers in US and outside.  Sounds good but for me is not.  I think US change the regulation for the investors or corporations, so.... to bring back US products and invite to other investors into the country.  As US president or a father in this country ... the people who lost jobs they should have another jobs available for them, so the economy keep going. If many investors invest in US probably US  needs more workers. the hire workers other countries as contract workers.  ."
Trump backtracks on tariffs necause of pressure from his own party! Hahahahaha get a backbone trump
"Finally the cheering section at Fox is muted somewhat by a bucket of cold reality. Trump's trade policies have never been a good idea and sadly, he seems unaware of how the economy functions. Hint: it's very complex and interwined with the US's largest partners built up over decades. Simplistic black and white solutions, which seem to dazzle the administration, won't work."
Tarrif is a beautiful thing. Pain for now but longterm it will pay off
Inherits stable economy - recklessly squanders it. Just what you'd expect from someone who inherited millions from Daddy and managed to bankrupt even casinos.
Reciprocal to yourself. Gaslighting at its finest from the person who started the problem.
God bless Trump he's the best president ever.
Expect your regular fox viewers to not believe a word your saying.
"Trump negotiated the deal we have now, perhaps Trump is not the negotiator he thinks he is."
"If you consider Trump and his goons, being on a russian payroll then everything makes perfectly sense !!!!!!!!!!!"
Finally the counter revolution has started
I mean this is what the people voted for right?? 
"April 2 , Trump Fools day.   What else would expect from a man who has declared bankruptcy 6 times."
Trump and his puppets should go to school to learn good manners Shame on you!
Unless these tariffs are like the old joke about training the mule. Guy hits mule in head with 2x4. Why?  First you have to get his attention. I can’t see these as permanent. Trump wants Tariffs reduced on US products. Which everyone seems to forget are everywhere. I’d like to see exactly what Tariffs other nations place on US products.
All the things we’ve been trying to warn you about….
"USA can’t fight against world …

Usa can tarrif one country …

But putting tarrif on multiple countries will collapse usa"
JD Vance wins for the most punchable face and worst attitude in politics ever. Glad to see Fox being autocratical on this nonsensical plan.
What an idiot.  Sounds like he's a little unclear on the definition of reciprocal.  HE put tariffs on his allies....THEY reciprocated by putting tariffs on the US.  THAT'S reciprocal.
"So turnip man tariffs Canada, we tariff back and then he’s going to tariff that much on top of his foolish tariffs? You guys are in such a mess down there. I can’t believe you’ve voted for this idiot"
Maybe Americans will wake up now
Respect to Fox News.
That's if things don't close for good and forever.
Everyone needs friends.
"Anyone thinking there's long term benefit because of this needs therapy.  Healing from Self inflicted wounds doesn't mean progress. You cannot strong arm your trading partner,  they will just build a more trusting relationship with other countries.  We are only isolating ourselves with these moves, which will create an economy in the US that is only affordable by the most wealthy of us."
I am not sure if my phone has been hacked and I am not looking at an AI generated video.
in other words they and the stock market called his bluff and now he backs down.
"reciprocal trade, reciprocal taxation, reciprocal regulation"
"ahhh, its cute saying ""it's not fair"" in a capitalist global system. Trying to force ""fairness"" in trade when the US doesn't have much to offer in terms of products Canada wants to purchase from the US."
Why doesn't Diaper Don just say we are bankrupt and need to pay back $800 billion to China with interest @2% that is $14 million a day interest only.
He’s folded again like a bad poker player
The pandemic was under Trump too
Mexico and Canada already have reciprocal trade agreements.
"he already backed off from the tariffs, next is the exaggerated border issues, he'll back off from it too soon "
The millionaires could care less.  That includes Big Orange and Assistant President Musk.
Keep the boycotts it’s working
Trump is the kidding president. Lowering grocery prices? Just kidding. Putting tariffs on Canada and Mexico?  Just kidding. Taking Greenland?  Just kidding.  Taking Panama?  Just kidding.  Making Gaza a resort?  Just kidding. Trump has done more kidding in his first month than most presidents do in 4...or 8 years.
"He started this sh-t, now he's trying to 180 it. Hilarious."
Just checked lumber futures from January. They are up 11% not 20
"""i wouldnt buy a car right now"".... or if you really want a car, you can get a japanese car, let the american companies go out of business. i guess."
"Create a crisis, convince the public that the system is failing, and then step in with a privatized solution that benefits corporations and Trump's cronies. ""How to Scam a Nation by Donald Trump: playbook"" - Chapter 1"
"Am I about to like a Fox Channel video? Ah well, here's a first!"
The empire is collapsing.
"APRIL FOOLS DAY ...
Appropriate for all  Canada Mexico EU and China to reciprocate...
Rename it Trump Day..he is a Fool"
Dodge Ram 80 thousand is now 100 thousand smh.
"I am thinking (hoping) trump is playing a long game. 
His negotiation style seems to be - start out with crazy inflated demands and then the other side comes to compromise at or around what he is actually trying to attain ... we shall see. But the people of the USA are near broken and there is no more room for economic struggle. It is getting nasty :/"
Can someone please tell Trump that we are living in a trade era? Every country does business with each other to have a growing economy. If Trump continues with his trade tariffs he will cause a national trade disaster. Stock markets will go down and everything will become more expensive for citizens. He will also cause inflation.
Am I seeing this correct fox is checking their boy trump????
Like a self imposed pandemic.
Anybody else curious about which of trumps millionaire friends shorted the market in the last couple weeks
"Republicans love tax, who knew?"
Poor Trump
100% Tariffs will be a permanent fix. 
How about we Make Recession Great Again?
"Blah blah blah, the United States, blah blah blah doge, blah blah blah. I’m the greatest who ever was ever I can  fix things in the past. No one can do that. I’m so good only I can do that. Listen to me because I know everything. I know anything about everything that ever was known in the universe and beyond."
Fox News. I am proud of you
Isn’t Trump a Economic Genius 
Well at least tax will go waaaay down
Working poor if you work your hole life to pay for free stuff for people around the world and your own country people like me are done with the free stuff
"The thing is that you rely products and materials from Canada, Europe & China. Canada & Europe on the other hand could create their own Facebook, WhatsApp etc in a couple of weeks whilst trading products and materials with one another. You don't have the hand you think you have and Canada are already showing you why."
With friends like Trump who needs enemies.
He makes a prediction hahaha. During the campaign people were telling everyone that TARIFFS were going to be a disaster. HOW can anything run when the guy in charge lies every time he opens his mouth. WAKE UP. How often does FOX have explain what Trump says every day.
"Some good ideas, but overall a complete disaster."
"Mexico will fold like a cheap suit, but Canadian opposition to all things American is growing.  As is the case with the EU.  If Trump wants a 51st state, Mexico is his for the asking."
this is the new normal
What the hell fox news criticizing their God donny
Don't think anyone is talk him out of that one fair is fair.
I didn’t vote for him;)
Hold on… is this FOX news?
Don’t be suddenly in love with Fox Entertainment
Still waiting for a response from trump about china’s retaliation on tariffs .. lol what cat got your tongue.

This clown of a president is going to bankrupt my businesse in buffalo.
Love the ‘outch’ at the end
Last time you’ll see him on this show…
create jobs :D yeah they will close factories in countries where they pay them around 20k per year and open factories in USA where they will pay them 50k-70k per year
Since when do we import lumber for construction?
The rats leaving the sinking ship...

This is just all for show he already paused them again today its just all part of his bully tactics
Yes it is would on the Auto industry if still made them here
"How’s those egg prices?  Well at least, other groceries will get just as expensive thanks to Trumps delusion trade war.  Go MAGA!"
Is America Great Again? ...Cuz Trump Flation is Killing Us 
What about tariffs on Maga merchandise?
The wild fires is the reason them lumber prices are up stop playing
The mad man n his stooges r getting more insane
Bunch of idiots clapping for tariffs. Fantastic.
So Fox is doing control damage? 
Stupid is as stupid does
good to see fox not propping these clown moves
"Trump 


USA "
Hahaha!!! This coming from fox about trump... America I hope you see it now
"An amazing amount of people here are content with the USA being ripped off by our trading partners. There doesn't have to be tariffs, just don't charge us any. If my friend needs to borrow $100 and I lend that to him and he pays me back $100, cool. Then I need to borrow $100 and he demands I pay him $125 back, how long should I continue to be friends with him or let him borrow money without interest?"
Some how some people will make billions from it though
He is an Fool no matter what day it is
I thought this  said wouldn't codt the us people and the other countries pay it? So why is everything increasing in price
trump belong to WWE not the government
So use your own resources and stop importing.
little Johnson needs to pay the price midterms with that grin on his face rise and fall with thump.
that idiot doesn't know how prices are set. he is making leaps evel knievel would be in awe of.
Trump start is terrible. Not very smart.
Canada have other market us people are dump so far all the people in canada support canadaian goverment but in us its different so think who is right and wrong. If america want  to start war let it start on us ground not on other country by sending misales.
With all of the different business bankruptcies and trump’s convictions on business fraud you would think that the republicans would stop looking to trump as some kind of business genius 
I doubt check this is Fox...
The fox is starting to show its teeth. Very soon someone on Fox will break cover and reveal what they really think about Trump's dog and pony show.

Have some faith in him. He's done wonderfully so far, in an amazingly short time."

Who gets accused of day? Doing something on Dec 25th won't get you accused of Christmas Day.
""
He's right on most things. He's a fool with these tariffs.
Most people can't afford these over priced new cars anyway! I don't see how it's going to effect that many middle class people! If these manufacturers already have record profit from building in Mexico and still price the cars way to high! Time for the big 3 to start losing some profits and maybe they will learn!

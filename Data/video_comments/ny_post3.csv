I'd like to point out to some who haven't really thought this through that distributors who have a mix of imported and domestic goods are likely to raise the price of domestic goods as well to remain competitive in the import business.  Also, domestic manufacturers who source ingredients or components will have their costs go up as well.  So those of you saying you can do without maple syrup and Molsen might need to expand your list a bit.  Tariffs used to enforce trade agreements or prevent product dumping are one thing but arbitrary tariffs used as some sort of enforcement for interdiction failings is like raising sales tax because too many people are speeding.

Canada's Tariff on US Dairy Products
As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2024, Canada imposes a tariff on dairy products imported from the United States. The tariff rates vary depending on the type and quantity of dairy products.
Class 7 Milk: 3.65% tariff
Ultrafiltered Milk: 14% tariff
Whey Protein Concentrate: 10% tariff
Butter: 298% tariff (yes, you read that right - nearly 300%!)
Cheese: 245% tariff
These tariffs were imposed as part of Canada's dairy supply management system, which aims to protect domestic dairy farmers and processors. However, it's worth noting that these tariffs have been a point of contention between the US and Canada, with the US arguing that they are unfair and restrict American dairy exports.
Please keep in mind that tariffs can change over time, so it's always best to check with reliable sources for the most up-to-date information.

Just like your less fortunate relatives have benefited financially from you, when you told them no more charity and it‚Äôs time for a fair deal, they threw a tantrum, claiming you also get benefits from them. Now let‚Äôs both impose tariffs. But they‚Äôre upset because they know that even though Canada charges a 25% or even much higher tariff on U.S. exports to Canada, it‚Äôs not the same as the U.S. charging 25% on Canadian exports to the U.S.

The 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised U.S. tariffs on twenty thousand imported goods, was framed as a piece of domestic legislation. But when it affected producers in Canada, Cuba, Europe, and elsewhere, it set off an international trade war, underlining the connection between global trade and international relations.

The fewer US goods the Canadians buy, the more US producers have to sell to the domestic market.  The USA exports a lot of dollars and those dollars come back to buy our goods, leaving fewer available for the US consumer.  Tariffs should be dropped on Canadian potatoes, a lot of potatoes go to waste and prices are way too high.

If üá®üá¶Canada was smart it would join BRICS. As it stands now Canada sells 98% of its LNG and 60% of its Natural Resources to the USA for very low prices. Canada exports 90% potash (fertilizer) to the USA. The idea that the United States ‚Äúsubsidizes‚Äù Canada to the tune of $200 billion annually is an erroneous interpretation of the economic and energy relationship between the two nations. This claim lacks the analytical rigor necessary to withstand scrutiny when we consider the facts. First, Canada is a critical supplier of energy to the U.S., providing a substantial portion of its crude oil and natural gas needs. Approximately 60% of U.S. crude oil imports come from Canada, most notably from Alberta's oil sands, a resource that represents a significant part of Canada's energy production CANADA ENERGY REGULATOR . The United States also imports 98% of Canada‚Äôs natural gas, an essential resource that powers homes and industries across the U.S. during the colder months EIA . This energy exchange is a matter of mutual necessity, not a one-sided dependency. The term ""subsidy"" implies one party is providing financial support to the other. In this context, it is crucial to distinguish between a trade relationship and a financial aid arrangement. The energy Canada provides is not given as a charity or a handout; it is sold at market prices, reflecting the value of the resources being exchanged. The United States, in return, exports over $300 billion in goods to Canada annually, including vehicles, machinery, and technology EIA . This reciprocal trade benefits both economies and underpins millions of jobs on both sides of the border. Furthermore, Canada‚Äôs defense contributions are often undervalued in discussions like these. Canada is not merely a passive recipient of American protection; the two countries cooperate through NORAD and share responsibility for the defense of North America. Canada‚Äôs military, though smaller than that of the U.S., plays an active role in peacekeeping and global security efforts. The assumption that Canada ""FREELOADS"" on the U.S. military is therefore logically flawed and ignores decades of joint action. In sum, this claim of a ""$200 billion subsidy"" does not withstand scrutiny when examined through the lens of facts. Canada‚Äôs role as a supplier of essential resources to the U.S. is a mutual exchange, one that supports both economies. Similarly, the defense partnership is based on shared responsibility, not a hierarchical arrangement where one side is a mere recipient of the other‚Äôs generosity. Thus, it is neither logical nor accurate to claim that the U.S. is subsidizing Canada in the manner implied by such statements. Instead, the reality is a balanced interdependence, rooted in economic and security cooperation.

all the gas and oil coming from Canada refined in US then go back to canada. what that means is energy price in canada going up 25% or more in few weeks. on the other hand US already prepared substitude suppler in line. Stop your open door policy that will be the only way this will end.

Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third- or fourth-largest.Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.

 Canadians are currently running around like their heads are cut off. 

99% of Canadians have spent almost a decade running around screaming ‚ÄúOrange man bad‚Äù grasping at any and  all information to prove their point. 

99% of Canadians did not LISTEN to anyone with a contradictory view point, instead chose to cancel, scream nonsensical and non applicable terms to silence the contradictory view point. 

Well Canada, welcome to the consequences of your utter ignorance. 

Until you understand how labeling works, do not waste your time. 

Made in Canada equals 51% of the product/process is done on Canadian soil.

Product of Canada equal 98% of product/process is done on Canadian soil. 

Before you choose Canadian companies ensure the following:

1. It is not a publicly traded company
2. It is not owned by a ‚Äúinvestment equity‚Äù company that partners with others outside Canada. 
3. Follow the money

Too bad none of you were concerned about all this during the US election when the POTUS was talking about using Tariffs as part of his economic strategy and took action then. 

Too bad none of you listened to what the POTUS was doing, ‚Äúmanifest destiny‚Äù. 

Too bad none of you listened to the conspiracy theorists around you who told you these things were coming. 

The POTUS wants us to secure our NORTHERN border against Russia and China. The POTUS wants us to pay our fair share of 2% to NATO. 

BUT

You are all distracted by the border between the US and Canada and the drugs. AND Orange man bad.

Your ignorance is what got us here because you all kept voting for the Glee club mouskateers.

And, so it begins. But then, with money raised on tariffs, perhaps we can go back to where the governments collect their taxes from the business transactions, and leave the individual pocketbooks in check. Sure, it raises prices but only on the products consumed. Perhaps people will go back to figuring out how to make their own food and alcohol, or rely on domestic products?

Ok, so where does this tariff money go?
Does it go to relief for those who now pay extra?
Does it go to relocating offshore companies to the USA?
The public needs to demand transparency on where this money is applied as it may be many years of paying extra before US companies spring up to replace the imports‚Ä¶at least naturally.
Tell me the tariff money immediately helps a Chinese factory relocate here and employ Americans, or that an American company is granted this tariff money to start up a replacement.
So far it‚Äôs just pay more, and have that extra returned to the US governments.
Basically a backdoor tax.

US imports more products from Canada than Canada does to US.  US consumers will suffer more.  US industry will profit.  Tarriffs just keep America dollars in the US but doesn't mean it's cheaper!  Means the US consumer will cover the extra cost. Basically the consumers in the US will pay the extra cost that US companies need to stay profitable vs Canadian.

Hey Trump supporters.
I've heard Trump say today that Canada doesn't have anything we need.
If that is the case, WHY does he insist he wants to make Canada the 51st state?
Doesn't make any sense to want a place that doesn't have anything we want or need to become part of this country.
Sorry, I'm just using Common Sense here. I understand that is a difficult thing for some people to do, but I can't figure out why he wants to make Canada a state if they would only be a burden to us.
Can someone explain to me why he would want that?

"Canada will now tax Americans on the use of the word ""eh""."
We've got North American trade war before GTA 6
Canada has had tariffs on US goods for years.
America start making your own goods.
So they are going to go up on the 270% tariff already on milk? In addition to the already 298% tariff on butter... People act like US is the only place using tariffs.
"""Strikes back?"" Canada ALREADY had tariffs of 300% on many American goods ... that's the reason Trump slapped tariffs on Canada. Do better, NYP."
I thought trudeau resigned
"Canada and Mexico have already been charging 25 to 300% tariffs on American products for years, But now that the US will be doing the same thing in return. People are acting like this sky is falling down."
My problem eith all of this is that the individuals making these decisions will feel none of the pain or discomfort because they already have the resources and finances that the common citizen doesn't.
Tariffs on Canadian products mean Americans stop buying Canadian products. Tariffs on American products just mean Canadians pay more for American products.
Doesn‚Äôt every other country have a tariff for America? So why wouldn‚Äôt we do the same?
The average Canadian does not even realize how parasitic the Canadian government has become on the United States.  The entitled mindset.  Bring it on Justin!
"Pull every single US automaker out of Canada, bring it back to the states."
Canada already has a 270% tariff on US dairy. Retaliates???
Everyone charges us tariffs why can‚Äôt we charge them back?
I'm impressed they found anything made in the USA.
So I am confused. If tariff's actually cost US citizens. Would the same not apply to Canadian citizens?
I thought Canada got rid of that nerd
Canada already had high tariffs on American goods.
"So what?! Trump used tariffs in his first term and we had the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment ever, lowest female unemployment in 50 years, gas under $3 a gallon, and inflation below 2%! They need us more than we need them! We have three states with larger economies than Canada!"
The problem is that the US only exports about 17% of total economy while Canada is about is about 76%. So guess who is going to win this contest.
"Canada already has almost 300% tariff on some of their goods to America!  America has lost 30 to 50 billion dollars a years trading with Canada since 1985! F~ that, it's time to even the trade balance instead of treating Canada like a welfare state of the USA!"
"What an idiot, Canada dollar has dropped big time in the last 24 hrs. What a fool to mess with Trump."
Stand strong Canada. We are not all magats in the US.
We should be making our own stuff with our own people
So other countries can tax us but we cant tax them?
It is a wake-up call for Canadians!
this won't go well for them
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bold strategy, Cotton. Let‚Äôs see if it pays off for them.‚Äù - Pepper Brooks"
"ME to ALL Canadians:   So long as Mr. Trudeau & other wokesters are in power at any level in Canada, tariffs from the USA and other nations are the LEAST of your great nation's problems."
"Lol, not like America gets a lot from Canada  Trump"
I thought this joker resigned.
Castro speaks.
This means more jobs in the USA as factories come back home to the USA. This means more factories in the USA will stay and less people will lose their jobs. More produce will be grown and packaged in the USA in more sanitary and healthier environments.
America can supply itself.  We can and should restore our industrial might and show the world how much we don't need them.
Didn‚Äôt he resign?
On other breaking news: the Mexican cartel are smuggling food into America for a killer profit 
"Canadian provinces have tariffs on each other! That puts it into a better perspective. 
Also, note that there is no mention of border security, fentanyl, human trafficking, or anything else of substance."
The tariff gets passed to the consumer...
"I'd like to point out to some who haven't really thought this through that distributors who have a mix of imported and domestic goods are likely to raise the price of domestic goods as well to remain competitive in the import business.  Also, domestic manufacturers who source ingredients or components will have their costs go up as well.  So those of you saying you can do without maple syrup and Molsen might need to expand your list a bit.  Tariffs used to enforce trade agreements or prevent product dumping are one thing but arbitrary tariffs used as some sort of enforcement for interdiction failings is like raising sales tax because too many people are speeding."
BREAKING: Major shortage of Maple Syrup
"See what happens when we dont let ourselves get walked on  everyone else flips out . Sick of what has become expected of america. My 50 hours a week isnt supposed to benefit the world, its supposed to benefit me"
What would you do to stop drugs from coming into our country?
"I like how people are upset the US is doing this when most countries do this already in order to keep their local economy stable and not let foreign economies who may product things cheaper wreck their own internal economy, its why you always see countries in asia use local made cars. Pretty sure canada has always done this for years with every country"
This child is going to play chess with Trump. Okay... I'm already chuckling. This isn't going to end well for Justin.
None of these people should be in charge of cleaning a bathroom more less government.
I thought he resigned.
Everyone blames America but maybe if Canada and Mexico fixed their problems leaking into the US there wouldn't have been tariffs in the first place
This is what America wanted.
Is this an America-first or America-hurt policy?
Is that Gavin Newsome?
"The phrase ""Canada strikes back"" is as weak as a soggy noodle trying to punch its way out of a paper bag."
We can produce everything we get from Canada üá∫üá∏
Ok buy American!!
Ew get this man off my screen
Canada just uses the US as a vacation spot.
Like Trudeau has any power here.....
I thought that Castro Jr resigned frim office?
You just know he's secretly trying to call Trump but Trump isn't answering.
Can‚Äôt we just do something about the fentanyl? My nephew died from an accidental OD.
"Oh, that hurts! "
"Thank you for having the courage to try something different President Trump.  We are a land of corrupt politicians, leeches only looking out for themselves.  While people are starving and dying.  If this country is meant to banish, let it go out with a fight instead of waiting 20-30 years with the status quo."
Ok well my shopping addiction is broken and won‚Äôt be the first time I ate beans and rice Praise the lord
Canada  VS  USA   um I wonder who would win  
SO!
"You said it, Governor Trudeau."
Well the news says we pay tariffs we impose.  So wouldn't Canada have to pay Canadian tariffs in that case?  Or is the news lying...
Is he still in charge?
Cool. Have fun finding food.
Sounds like we need to start giving incentives to Americans to build more businesses in America so we can buy American and say efff you to the rest of these cry baby countries that have done nothing but profit off us. America should be self sufficient anyways.
Canada exports 22 percent of its GDP to the US.     America exports 1.5 percent of its to Canada.     Canada has no bargaining power here.
Sit down Terdaeu! You quit remember!
I thought he quit
Does he realize who he's dealing with? Most individual states have a bigger economy than Canada
I don‚Äôt care if I have to pay more for some products.I consider it an investment in my country.Canada and Mexico have been taking advantage of us for years
"Ok, so Trudy is saying, ""Tariffs work"""
i thought this guy resigned/removed from his position?
That is like shooting a plastic BB at an African elephant
I‚Äôm not worried! Only 10% of the American economy is derived from Canadian exports
"Whatever you say, governor"
What do we need from Canada?
Fix your border. Trump will talk. Explain to your citizens why he‚Äôs doing it.
Canada! We don't claim him!
a complete fool ...just leave Canadians alone
Walmart will not stop importing from Mexico and Canada. They'll just raise their prices.
Neither of these people care because the consumers are going to pay that bill
lol Can't wait till we own Canada.
Trudeau will regret this. Just watch. 
So no more hockey and no more sliced ham
Time to pay up Canada. Been covering your tail for too long.
"Libs: This is what you voted for! Me: Yup! this is EXACLTY what I voted for. The world is so used to having this one sided relationship with the US, that they think that when we demand to be treated fairly, that we're being preposterous.  AMERICA FIRST BABYYYY!"
LOL No-go Trudeau has zero political clout
"It's like watching two children play a game of chicken. Also, isn't he removing himself from office in a few months? It kinda feels like he's punishing Canadians for not liking him. So he goes and gives them another reason not to like him."
We don't need Canada..
Trump will get his way.
were 40% of their economy
Didn't this guy quit?
I thought Trudeau resigned
Canada will lose on this war 
Dude is cracked out!
"I am shaking in my TX boots  

Canada‚Äôs economy is smaller than even that of Texas Ô∏è"
Great‚Ä¶..
25% tariff on hockey sticks and pucks.
All talk
Is this what his million dollar advisors told him to do?
"Canada's Tariff on US Dairy Products
As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2024, Canada imposes a tariff on dairy products imported from the United States. The tariff rates vary depending on the type and quantity of dairy products.
Class 7 Milk: 3.65% tariff
Ultrafiltered Milk: 14% tariff
Whey Protein Concentrate: 10% tariff
Butter: 298% tariff (yes, you read that right - nearly 300%!)
Cheese: 245% tariff
These tariffs were imposed as part of Canada's dairy supply management system, which aims to protect domestic dairy farmers and processors. However, it's worth noting that these tariffs have been a point of contention between the US and Canada, with the US arguing that they are unfair and restrict American dairy exports.
Please keep in mind that tariffs can change over time, so it's always best to check with reliable sources for the most up-to-date information."
When Canada no longer receives billions upon billions in subsidies from America Princess Trudeau will think differently. 
Cut there money to them I don't understand why we give them money
Trump Is Not Playing Games!
"Ooohh, scary!"
The state police in Michigan will be looking for Canadians driving through here to give you a travel tariff. Kidding.... maybe.
Asshoke!
"Its called a negotiation tactic. First person to give in loses the initiative, and the winner gets to lay down the ground rules, otherwise the tarrifs continue.

Also, there are already TONS of tarrifs on goods from every country long b4 trump enacted new ones  this is nothing new, we as a country will just have to shoulder through it for a bit when it comes to certain goods from canada or mexico Ô∏è whoopty woo, get your dairy NOT from cananda "
Trudeau about as popular as terminal illness
If you see made in Canada put it back on the shelf 
I'm not a big fan of trade wars but there has been an imbalance in trade restrictions and tariffs for years. I love my Canadian friends but they are going to get their azzes kicked in this one
He is not a great leader or a wise one.
The Canadian are going to tar and  you for thier favorite  bud light   and o .j 
I hate him.
See how long Canada will last 
Oh No!!!!! We the American people will have to purchase our maple syrup on the black market now üá∫üá≤
LOL... America don't even need Canada one single bit. Same can't be said the other way around
American jobs coming right quickly. TRUMP IS DOING THE RIGHT THING
We have plenty more customers 
I thought he was stepping down.
This American understands and supports Trudeau's decision. Apologies to our respected Canadian neighbors.
"Nice goal, eh ?"
Trudeau finally grew a little tiny ball?
Your economy has been driven into the ground and you respond this way rather than negotiating.  Who is buying US goods up there?  The Government?
Enjoy your scurvy Canada
lol what does canada even have
"Thanks Trump - ya know you could just cut out some tax breaks or put the corporate tax break back where it was to gain revenue with the added benefit of not providing an excuse for more price gauging... Ya that dumb or you doing this on purpose, Trump? pull your head out MAGA"
Finally a tariff on plastics... We need to use less plastic
Why is our 51st state putting tariffs on us?? They better stop or we won't let them be a state anymore
Their acting like they supply the whole us
lol... says the dude that resigned.
OH NOOOOOOO
 a beta trying to be leader on his way out! This doesn't look like strength it looks pathetic.
Why does the US have to subsidize Canada? All the thinks he listed as items for tariff are made here in abundance. Buy US and help a fellow citizen.
US will stop outsourcing any thing from now on.
Ok. I‚Äôll see your tariff and raise you with  ‚Äúnow your a terrorist‚Äù and Canada will be known as eastern Alaska
George McFly
Oh no where am I going to buy my moose meat now?
25% tariffs on Hockey Pucks big deal
You heard it guys.. no more Orange Juice.
All Canada had to do was help with stopping drug traffic and close border to migrants. Very simple solution on Canadas side.
I stand with President Trump! I trust him more than someone who has not done the right thing for his country.
"Oooooh, we‚Äôre shaking Turdeau. What are you going to do next, freeze our bank accounts? "
He stands there looking at his people like a dictator.
"So...the Canadian response is to Tariff themselves until they find alternatives? Justin...bro if you have not resolution for ALTERNATIVES...you just lost the entire game. Trump will control those alternatives. JUST ADMIT you are wrong, did wrong and step down. Just think what you did to your own people. BYE FELICIA!"
"We don't have to worry about a thing the population in Canada will handle that mess,"
"It's unlikely that tariffs will positively affect the price of eggs, healthcare, or housing. Hard

to be a ""great country"" without these issues being addressed."
"This guy is a clown.
Donald will own you."
Keep your maple syrup it's not worth it.
Maple syrup... EH?
wasnt this guy supposed to resign?   What a liar. Not one thing I buy comes from Canada. NOT ONE!!!
The US has been paying 200% plus on some items imported from Canada.  Guess everyone forgot about that huh?
"This is probably the worse thing he could have done, now trump will higher his tariffs and destroy the already failing economy of canada..."
"Hey Justin, you can perhaps help puking back out the money you gulped past decade. Oh yes you can brother."
Tough guy 
"Oh no, seventy-five cents more for a bottle of maple syrup. How will I survive."
Everything Canada supplies can be supplied by someone else or the US can just ramp up production.  The United States is one of the few nations on the planet that can be nearly self-sufficient.
"Oh my, gonna miss that Maple Syrup and the Molsen Beer "
Has any American seen the list of high tariffs Canada ALREADY imposes on US?
"If Trump had said ""Tariffs will need to rise a little to be on par with our trading partners,  at this crucial time in American  history"" they'll be helping us now. Words matter."
Trump is the greatest!
"Just like your less fortunate relatives have benefited financially from you, when you told them no more charity and it‚Äôs time for a fair deal, they threw a tantrum, claiming you also get benefits from them. Now let‚Äôs both impose tariffs. But they‚Äôre upset because they know that even though Canada charges a 25% or even much higher tariff on U.S. exports to Canada, it‚Äôs not the same as the U.S. charging 25% on Canadian exports to the U.S."
"According to the White House, the reason for the tariffs are illicit drugs and illegal migration.   Isn't it in the interest of all countries to address this issue?"
Let's make things in the USA again. Give our people work and prosper our businesses!
"Canada - Eh sorry

USA - We dont care"
Why is Canada buying lumber from the USA when they have the biggest forest in the world.
What a joke. The amount that will be tariffed is small and won't cause many issues for Americans.
Trump all the way  Canada should have got rid of Justin trodo
"Why is the story of David and Goliath coming to mind? Is it reallly necessary to bully our neighbors? Lord, we need help."
Worrying about syrup taxes now got me feeling like a 16th century dutch peasant
"Our friendly neighbors, Canada‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so shameful of the United States‚Äôs Trump and his cronies!"
You mean ADDITIONAL tariffs? Yes buddy Canada already had high tariffs on American goods. This is going to hurt Canadians more than Americans. Way to go buddy !
America has flipped the switch.   We're back ON.
Make America self-sufficient Again. We have everything we need here.
Canada cant afford to retaliate but yet they do anyways. Shows the integrity of their leadership right there.
What about the Canadian citizens occupying American jobs? The US granting the TN visa has to stop. That time is now!
"Lumber import from Canada may hit US hard. Think about how even higher lumber costs could impact America. If in doubt, consider what happened with COVID."
"The 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised U.S. tariffs on twenty thousand imported goods, was framed as a piece of domestic legislation. But when it affected producers in Canada, Cuba, Europe, and elsewhere, it set off an international trade war, underlining the connection between global trade and international relations."
"The fewer US goods the Canadians buy, the more US producers have to sell to the domestic market.  The USA exports a lot of dollars and those dollars come back to buy our goods, leaving fewer available for the US consumer.  Tariffs should be dropped on Canadian potatoes, a lot of potatoes go to waste and prices are way too high."
Bye bye Canada.
Just read that after the election they surveyed the businesses in Canada and 60% said they were moving to the US.
Viva president TRUMP we support hie every steps.
why do retaliatory tariffs exist if the tariffs are paid by the purchaser? Wouldn't that mean that Canada isn't effected by American tariffs? I am failing to truly understand why this is going on.
Oh no!!!  Where will I get my maple syrup now?
Why? We threatened Venezuela with Tariffs because they wouldn‚Äôt take back their own citizens. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre dropping any Canadians back in Canada. I wish this clown would just resign already.
I‚Äôm an American and your actions are justified
"Double the tariffs, canada needs us for their exports,  I don't think there is a demand in other countries for their products, nor do they have the capability to export such large trade overseas."
Trudeau resigned. This is BS.
It‚Äôs ok. We really don‚Äôt need anything from Canada. They definitely need stuff from them.
This is fine. I don't want to buy anything from Canada anyway!
"Let's see: How much do we buy from Canada? How much does Canada buy from us? Go ahead, Canada, make my day, eh?"
"Oh no, where will i get my maple syrup, Canadian bacon, and reruns of The Collector now?!"
Canada will be specifically targeting red and swing states with these tariffs.
That's hilarious since Canada's exports to the US are 20% of their GDP while USA's exports to Canada are only 2% of GDP.
" Like Canada has ANYTHING that we Americans don't already have in abundance here. This video is so funny, it's OLD SCHOOL 70's SNL funny. Back when SNL was funny. Trudeau putting sanctions on America "
150 Billions dollEH worth of TaxEH will be imposed on United State of AmericEH. now that sounds ProperEH
Go ahead Canada !! you need America more than we need your products let‚Äôs see how long you will last !! Trump said being fare in trade you don‚Äôt want that obviously!!!
"American should never buy another vehicle made in Canada or anything else from there.  I will be watching my tags from now on and if it is made in Canada, I can do without it."
this dude is portrayed in the Swedish state media as some kind of hero
America‚Äôs former allies need to form an economic and diplomatic alliance to isolate Trump and discourage further abuses by his administration.
Boycott Canadian goods. Wake up America !
Why is a dude who resigned as Prime Minister still acting like he's still Prime Minister?
We had to change up in the US...if not by 2040 we would of been at like 70 trillion in debt...then the world would have a real problem
Canada. Forgive us we know not what we do!
Send Jim Carey back. We're keeping Mickey Redmond.
"Franklin D. Roosevelt who said, ""
In politics nothing is by accident, if it happens , you can be sure we planned it that way.‚Äù"
Trump is the GOAT
how about we don't need to get high no more on alcohol and keep all the garbage the US deposit for them.
"I'm an American, and I support these retaliatory tariffs. The dimwits in the middle of our country need to feel the pain of their idiotic vote.

I'd also suggest placing a 300% tariff on all teslas, and other goods manufactured by the oligarchs that have thrown their hat in with Trump. Make them, and his voters feel the pain. If it affects the rest of our country, so be it, we are the baddies, we don't get to complain."
We don‚Äôt need anything they need in America. Why is he still in charge
Canada needs to import a lot more to their climate than the United States does to theirs. Canadians need imports. Americans can produce enough at home to not need imports.
Let's see what economy could hold out the longest. First US needs to stop sending billions to Canada. No more military protection.
It‚Äôs a compliment that Canada doesn‚Äôt like America actually. I don‚Äôt think about Canada or anyone from there at all.
"I think Southpark predicted this in an older episode, and it didn't end well for Canada"
"Keep your maple syrup, Vermont‚Äôs is better anyways cause it‚Äôs grown in sweet American soil."
Likely means the US should produce more of it's own goods and not import as much from other countries. Since tariffs will likely affect goods that are imported or exported the most.
"Oooh, ouch. Now we'll have to buy American Bacon."
"Cut off oil sales to the US, sell it to Europe and South America."
Does anyone else feel like this guy is still in middle school?
"Yes, US needs to stop dealers and buyers"
Even Canadians can`t stand this guy.
As an American I am fully on Canada‚Äôs side on this
"A lot of people in this comment section that doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening yet still voicing there opinion, the whole idea behind these tariffs is to start producing our own goods and products in America and the goal over the next 4 years to no longer be reliant on a foreign country for America to survive, so yes in the beginning of all this prices will rise until we get our own factories and companies going"
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has resigned and is not well liked in Canada. Change can't happen soon enough.
"WE MAKE our own liquor, beer, wine etc..."
Way to go Trump! Stick it to the man!
Trump 2024
Tariffs are great!!!!  Imagine how much money we could make tariffing the billions we give Israel at 25%.  Let's increase that give-away.
"challenge people to grow food and trade it among your neighbors.

Skills sets.
Know how to sew.

Teach others.

We will make it."
Retaliatory? Canada already has high tariffs on American goods lol
Trump thinks he can bully everyone... I think he's beginning to realize that he lives in a dream world.
We don‚Äôt need anything from Canada.
"What does Canada have to offer the US?  Some maple syrup?  
And, why don't they give us their defense money since they don't really have an army.  The only reason other countries don't attack Canada is because the US is next door."
QUICK! Hoard all of the maple syrup and poutines!
Cut off all commerce and industry with Canada and see them change their tune over night.
"Just a few of the tariffs Canada hits America with. 

Milk: 270%
Cheese: 245%
Butter: 298%
Chicken: 238%
Sausages: 69.9%
Barley seed: 57.8%
Bovine/meat: 26.5%
Cars: 25%
HVAC: 45%
Vacuums: 35%
Cable boxes: 35%
TVs: 45%
Steel: 25%
Aluminum: 45%
Copper: 48%"
"Well, if I can't afford to buy 'whatever' from Canada, so what? I can't afford to buy a lot of things right now. I just don't care."
"Tariffs arent terrible, it promotes the country creating the goods themselves which expands their economy.  Yes I know that also depends on the countries ability to produce such an item, but maybe not tariff what you cant make yourself."
Wait till he finds out they're gonna have to pay for their own military protection and nuclear deterrence lol.
"I'm sorry, but I just need to throw this out here. I have never once in my life. Seen anything that said made in Canada."
"If it says: Made in China, Mexico or Canada it stays on the shelf."
"Heck, look at the prices Canada imposes on its own people Ô∏è"
"I like how Canada embraced hunger games motto: ‚ÄúIf we burn, you‚Äôll burn with us!‚Äù 

Stand up to the bullies Canada!"
Manufacturing will never come back to the U.S. Big buisness will outsource in an integrated global economy and the politicians will help them.
"If üá®üá¶Canada was smart it would join BRICS. As it stands now Canada sells 98% of its LNG and 60% of its Natural Resources to the USA for very low prices. Canada exports 90% potash (fertilizer) to the USA. The idea that the United States ‚Äúsubsidizes‚Äù Canada to the tune of $200 billion annually is an erroneous interpretation of the economic and energy relationship between the two nations. This claim lacks the analytical rigor necessary to withstand scrutiny when we consider the facts. First, Canada is a critical supplier of energy to the U.S., providing a substantial portion of its crude oil and natural gas needs. Approximately 60% of U.S. crude oil imports come from Canada, most notably from Alberta's oil sands, a resource that represents a significant part of Canada's energy production CANADA ENERGY REGULATOR . The United States also imports 98% of Canada‚Äôs natural gas, an essential resource that powers homes and industries across the U.S. during the colder months EIA . This energy exchange is a matter of mutual necessity, not a one-sided dependency. The term ""subsidy"" implies one party is providing financial support to the other. In this context, it is crucial to distinguish between a trade relationship and a financial aid arrangement. The energy Canada provides is not given as a charity or a handout; it is sold at market prices, reflecting the value of the resources being exchanged. The United States, in return, exports over $300 billion in goods to Canada annually, including vehicles, machinery, and technology EIA . This reciprocal trade benefits both economies and underpins millions of jobs on both sides of the border. Furthermore, Canada‚Äôs defense contributions are often undervalued in discussions like these. Canada is not merely a passive recipient of American protection; the two countries cooperate through NORAD and share responsibility for the defense of North America. Canada‚Äôs military, though smaller than that of the U.S., plays an active role in peacekeeping and global security efforts. The assumption that Canada ""FREELOADS"" on the U.S. military is therefore logically flawed and ignores decades of joint action. In sum, this claim of a ""$200 billion subsidy"" does not withstand scrutiny when examined through the lens of facts. Canada‚Äôs role as a supplier of essential resources to the U.S. is a mutual exchange, one that supports both economies. Similarly, the defense partnership is based on shared responsibility, not a hierarchical arrangement where one side is a mere recipient of the other‚Äôs generosity. Thus, it is neither logical nor accurate to claim that the U.S. is subsidizing Canada in the manner implied by such statements. Instead, the reality is a balanced interdependence, rooted in economic and security cooperation."
How is Justin Trudeau even continuing to speak for the people of Canada?
trump is making the poor poorer.
"I just want to be treated fairly. Canada had tariffs on some of our stuff, along with every other country. But we are the bad guys to do the same? Find me a country we have fair, across the board trade with."
SouthPark predicted it.  Canada will go on a temper tantrum and go on strike.
"I think if USA and Israel left the world alone don‚Äôt give and don‚Äôt take do not put your military in any city ,the world will live happily,please please USA and Israel leave the world alone believe no city wants your stuff or money just stay in America"
"Justin, you are never going to win this battle buddy. Back down."
lol. we dont need anything from Canada.  we'll get Vermont maple syrup.  even their hockey teams play in our league.  hahahahahahahha
"If this war, if this tariff war is going to go on, Canada is going to lose tremendously"
Hint to Trudea: Don‚Äôt play checkers with a 4-D chess master! Checkmate! You lose! Ô∏è
F Canada in Mexico
Are you forgetting that you already have tariffs on us and that it was only the United States that didn't have tariffs
Funny thing is that most Canadian people would rather become part of the United States. They can‚Äôt stand Trudeau .
"Everyone better learn quickly how to pray, budget and save or youre really going to be struggling. "
guess when Trump said stop the drugs coming across the border you should have had a different answer than what you gave.
I see people still don‚Äôt understand what tariffs are or how they work.
Sooooo..... Syrup is gonna be 50 cents more? That's fine
If he's dumb for making this decision while other countries are doing the same.
Don't want to pay Trump's tariffs? Then secure your border! Trump said that if you don't act to secure your border then he will enact tariffs. So get off your lazy seat and do what is right for your people.
I guess we need to figure out how to be independent on our own.
"Lets compare percentage of GDP of import/exports between the USA and Canada.... This is political theatre, their tariffs will have little economic impact on the US economy compared to what the US tariffs will have on theirs."
It's a means to an end. I don't think engaging in a trade war with the biggest economy on earth is gonna work out well.
Oh no hockey sticks will cost $5 more. Lol.
"For some, having an unfair advantage for so long, makes it difficult to be fair ...         Peace"
"I like the Canadians, but America first."
"So Canadian government had a choice, help your neighbor with the border or have a trade war ?"
Oh no.  My maple syrup is going to go up.  Shut up trudeau...
do not purchase Canadian goods....  buy American made products only....
Ok Americans lets step it up... whose willing to go out and plant and pick and grow anything and all things that America needs 
That's funny and boy are they going to regret this decision
I thought TURDO stepped down? looks like he is still twerking Canada all around!
The Princess of Peoplekind.
"Trump said we don't need their ""stuff""."
Thought this dictator was gone?
"I don't think America has to worry. We don't have cheap labor to make any of that stuff now anyway. Canada is smart enough to have picked goods that they know we will be making less of in the next few months, lol."
"So what?  All country's should tax goods being shipped in to their own country... Especially on goods that are, or can be made in their own country."
I think that they need our stuff more than we need their stuff.
"Well, it looks like I'm going to be starting an orange juice smuggling business."
Canada will not last much longer with this toad Castreau play-acting as PM.
"Absolutely trust Trump on this one. 
Let's see who blinks first."
"Weüá∫üá∏can consume less.
With what we produce, we can survive.

Let their economy surge."
Canada dollar value is already dropping. They dont want to play this game.
Such shameful and disloyal against allies.  And so bad for Americans!
"Go higher, USA, USA, USA!"
I am sorry that our country's leader is so inept. I'm also sorry that so many who should have known better voted for him anyway.
"Trump gonna take that 250 billion dollars away, the US been giving you "
Canada has higher tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods.
Thanks Trump for making things worse! 
Me now that canadian bacon is off the table: 
"Not being sarcastic here, but I literally have no idea what I have ever bough that was made in Canada. Maybe parts in a car?"
Canada's Trudeau had a chance to change course on immigration and negotiate on trade. He chose intransigence. Reap what you sow.
Stop all protection of Canada.
It will be worse for Canada than for America. I thought Trudeau resigned?
Come on Canada let‚Äôs play hardball. You wanna play your BS let‚Äôs do this for whatever it‚Äôs worth.  Justin Trudeau will regret his words.
"Oh snacks, I don't think me or any one I know has ever bought a ""made in Canada"" item"
"Canada will lose this bluff, bigly."
This is as much as a threat as Canada having a land war with us using spears.
Hope our government will send some money to help food prices going up
Trudeau resigned who gives a F what he has to say?
I didn't know Canada manufactured anything.
He's not going to win and neither will Mexico. 
So convince Trump to begin a trade alliance with Russia and let American producers ship their products there.
"So, instead of doing what is right and helping stop the flow of illegal drugs and illegal border crossings from Canada Trudeau thinks the best way is to retaliate with his own tariffs. How about doing your job and keeping people and drugs from crossing the border? What would do if it was the other way around, wouldn't you expect the US to help keep people from crossing into Canada illegally from the US?"
He would die without his Taylor Swift albums.
"If they slap a large export tax on potash, dimensional softwood lumber, and wood heating pellets....... american ag inputs, new build home prices, and heating costs will spike. This is full blown dumb."
"Very soon they're going to come back crying to Trump for forgiveness,"
"There will be no tariff when Canada is a part of the US. Let's end this nonsense together, eh"
Wait I thought he resigned as prime minister like how is he still f**** calling the shots.
This guy is starting a war he cannot win
lol you know how funny this is. i see more and more Canadians moving here and seeing them shopping here.
Don't think I will ever buy Canadian anything til they replace Trudeau...
"I was honestly opposed to the tariffs up until right now, i hate Trudeau that much, it's the ultimate reverse psychology for me."
Your a punkin head
Now I‚Äôll buy us grade A maple syrup.
FJT
Oh great when three jobs isn't enough the alternative he's speaking is you'll have to work four jobs....
"Same as a child threatening to hold their breath till they get the candy bar, go ahead"
This guy needs to step down earlier and NEVER talk again
Canada just committed economic suicide.
Trudeau had no idea what‚Äôs coming. He‚Äôs a lame duck PM
Prices are going up even further across the board.
just send the troops and take Canada  and make it part of the US. not like they can fight it
Canada surrendered today!!
Is this the new Europe?  Terrifying‚Äô o ; I mean  tariffing each other
To the people of Canada i feel bad for you & understand most Canadians dont agree wt trudo
"Trump needs significant funds to execute his ""deportation project""."
all the gas and oil coming from Canada refined in US then go back to canada. what that means is energy price in canada going up 25% or more in few weeks. on the other hand US already prepared substitude suppler in line. Stop your open door policy that will be the only way this will end.
I thought tariffs were paid by the company importing? This has no effect on anyone but them?
Truedough. Such an original thinker. You still fleecing the honest folks in Canada? Get going out the door. Canada will be much better off without you.
"Oh no, maple syrup is going through the roof."
"LOL, the United States doesn't need anything from Canada, we have all of the stuff we need here, Justin can grandstand all he wants to but it's all a joke."
"Look at that, the other countries can do tariffs too??? Whoaaaa, who would have thought?"
I'm more familiar with the Mexican case of warping the NAFTA deal by opening a wide free trade door for EU and Asian end runs to enter the U.S. market tariff free. What about Canada?
the main reason for the Tarrifs is to encourage Local industry.....so.......yea please incentivize us more Mr. Village People
...or you could just strengthen your border.
I thought this coward resigned?
how is this making American great again?????
Canada will kneel to America soon enough
I wish Canada was still British
This will blow over once both groups sit down and make a deal . After over 30 of status quo antebellum. Things need a shake up any how
Is this like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK?
"OH NO!
The price of canadian bacon will go up!"
Well done Prime Minister Trudeau!
Canada has nothing we don‚Äôt have already
Tough talk from a dude who resigned in disgrace. Let's see how long they hold before they step in line.
thank you your tariffs on the US will create some what of a surplus here in the US and most likely reduce prices in the long run  based on volume while giving traction to our US products here at home
"Now everything Canadiens buy will go up in price, imports and domestics‚Ä¶he‚Äôs really sticking it to his own people"
Oh no.. not Justin Trudeau.  What a powerful retort.
Who Cares. Sit down Castro.
They need us we don‚Äôt need them.
"America tariffs Canadian oil, hitting them once. Then Canada enacts tariffs refined petroleum products they buy from the US using their crude, hitting them again. No wonder it's called Cana-DUH.  "
"ROFL lol Canada and Mexico doesn't even equal the GDP of California, sit down and learn something."
"I think that was the original problem, Prime Minister."
Poor Canada üá®üá¶ . . Your not the only one living a bad episode of ‚Äú The Twilight Zone ‚Äú . .   . .   . .   . . What day is it

"Poor Justin Trueblow, hes trying hard to impress Trump"
Canada is one of our best allies .. why them?
"oh lord no, what will they do with out Orange Juice?  It's not like they own Flordia"
We don't care!!! Pay your dues!!!
"Why is he talkin, I thought his own people wanted him OUT!"
Why does Trudeau always sound like he's doing a funeral eulogy.
don't woory canada you won't starve for at least 2 weeks
He is actually calling Trumps bluff 
Texas already lost Pornhub and we're doing fine. I don't think this hurts us much.
we need them for nothing.....
Smells like freedom is on its way.
I thought Castro Jr stepped down already
Strikes back? We import about 15% from Canada and the export about 80% to America. I say lets take our chances!
"Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third- or fourth-largest.Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy. What is the United States doing?"
Tarif it will raise the prices of goods and people of Canada and US will be paying more. What is the benefit for either country I don‚Äôt understand. It definitely will support local businesses but not average citizens from each side. Local producers will rase  the prices and make more money and will pay more taxes. I don‚Äôt see any benefit for average citizens. BS as usual
If i were Trump i would not impose the tariffs...its clearly diluting the once great relationship between Canad√° and M√©xico... they are very important to this great nation... if we continue to persue these tariffs  it will isolate the USA in a way that may be detrimental in ways most can't foresee ... trump take care of Mexico and Canada whether you like it or not ...believe me it benefits the nation more than you can perceive
Say goodbye to Canada 
Canada vs America is like a tug of war between a mouse and a lion 
ngl canada has already taxed Americas butts into oblivion to the point we ship a lot less over there now. so this wont really hurt us as much as its hurting them. but maybe every nation should depend on its own people to make their own goods rather then depend on cheaper labor from somewhere els.
Notice he didn't say a thing about American automobiles?
Coming from the guy that resigned...classy.

Pierre can't be seated quickly enough.
Strike back with 1000% tarrifs on all Canadian goods. Tear off the bandaid and let's get this over with and finally demand fair trade deals.
Didn't this guy resign? Is this old footage? Why are you showing him when he had no say anymore in the politics of Canada?
Canada is about to FAFO.
Canada I like you as neighbors but please do something about your government. We fixed our side so it‚Äôs your turn.
"Oh nooooo. Whatever will we do?  
‚Ä¶.oh. Wait. I‚Äôm an American  "
Help yourself. It‚Äôs only going to hurt you the most
Is there anything being made in the USA?  Really???? It doesn't seem like it.

"Canada has like 30% of their GDP in trade with America compared to like maybe 3% of American trade going to Canada. Yeah, Trudolf is a genius, LOL! I'm gonna make a huge bucket of popcorn and watch Trudolf make an even larger complete fool of himself than he already is."
Couldn't tell you the last thing I purchased that was from Canada
I dont think I use anything coming out of Canada‚Ä¶ this is gonna wreck Canada
That's really cool maybe our prices will go down then
"But all the goods they sell us pretty much comes from us  
This is not going to go well for anyone and there will be less and less sales because nobody can afford it as it is anyway."
I thought Trudeau was stepping down.
Yay! Lets make the rich richer and make the poor people pay the difference! WOOHOOO
"Hey, maybe President Trump should add extra taxes, or halts, to all those Canadian snow birds who enjoy the warm states of the USA in winter."

"Let‚Äôs stop bringing these products there, they can munch on maple leaves lol"
"The first and only time I agree with this goof.
What comes from Canada? Hot dog pizzas?"
"Yeah, because SOOO many products I use come from Canada...."
Time to buy some chickens and raise a garden.
"look local. we buy our meat, milk and wood locally. this is the proble?. convenience vs planning. Americans have become spoiled by instant results vs proper planning, and it is so much cheaper in the long run. Support local."

Break the Canadian economy!
So your just stating your already existing tariff policy?
What does the U.S. get from Canada?
Bring it Justin Trudeau aren‚Äôt you leaving.
Yawn. You can't win. You haven't got the market.
I've NEVER once seen one Made in Canada product in my entire life in any of my USA stores.. Also it's nice to see Justin Trudugh boy making Canada great again with his nationalistic tax on his own country just like he is saying America is taxing them. Justin is a MAGA boy now!
Canada has 20 million people. How much do they buy from USA? USA has 340 million people. Simple math. Canada has more to loose
I don‚Äôt think will end well for Canada
They are manufacturing inflation and shortages.
"Trump negotiated the USMCA trade agreement in  2020. He touted as the fairest,  most balanced and beneficial trade agreement ""   He wants to be like Putin and take land."
We don‚Äôt need you Canada   You were always too expensive anywayn
let the games BEGIN!!!!!!!!
Please governer respect your president
Just join the EU
GO T!! Sounds like this is going to cost Canada and Mexico a fortune. Its about the end game so if we have to pay a little more now to have more later then Im willing to take that chance. Doing the same thing over and over is the definition of Crazy so lets have faith and think out of the box for a while.
"We will see who will be the winner here, my guess USA !"
Sad. Love is more important.
I‚Äôm so afraid of Trudeau!
I thought you stepped down. You just made a serious mistake goi ng against the USA

"I'm on a spending diet, so thanks for the enforcement."
What do i need from Canada that isn't also made in the U.S.?  Lemme think...nothing!
He Has NO POWER... Check out the PIPELINE MAP. UNITED STATES OWNS CANADA!!!
America isolationism speed run
is this really a strike back or a shot in Canada's foot?
An American lapdog bites back at its master 
Get back to Made in America then this will not matter at all.
And Canada will fold
"The way he's saying it . He should settle it with Trump with a fight, 2 rounds 2 minutes each round"
Oh oh! Now we in trouble!
"Did he age 10 years in the last few weeks, or is it just me?"
Canada responded.........DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"US will start their own manufacturing co. no longer depending on other countries...if i am not mistaken, there is only a 2.35% tariffs on goods from canada...what you complaining about?..."
Not an original thought in his tiny little head...bless his heart.

Oh no!  The need us and we don‚Äôt need them lol. Buckle up Canada
We welcome you Canada but first get read of that guy
Do they understand how small there country is?
" Canadians are currently running around like their heads are cut off. 

99% of Canadians have spent almost a decade running around screaming ‚ÄúOrange man bad‚Äù grasping at any and  all information to prove their point. 

99% of Canadians did not LISTEN to anyone with a contradictory view point, instead chose to cancel, scream nonsensical and non applicable terms to silence the contradictory view point. 

Well Canada, welcome to the consequences of your utter ignorance. 

Until you understand how labeling works, do not waste your time. 

Made in Canada equals 51% of the product/process is done on Canadian soil.

Product of Canada equal 98% of product/process is done on Canadian soil. 

Before you choose Canadian companies ensure the following:

1. It is not a publicly traded company
2. It is not owned by a ‚Äúinvestment equity‚Äù company that partners with others outside Canada. 
3. Follow the money

Too bad none of you were concerned about all this during the US election when the POTUS was talking about using Tariffs as part of his economic strategy and took action then. 

Too bad none of you listened to what the POTUS was doing, ‚Äúmanifest destiny‚Äù. 

Too bad none of you listened to the conspiracy theorists around you who told you these things were coming. 

The POTUS wants us to secure our NORTHERN border against Russia and China. The POTUS wants us to pay our fair share of 2% to NATO. 

BUT

You are all distracted by the border between the US and Canada and the drugs. AND Orange man bad.

Your ignorance is what got us here because you all kept voting for the Glee club mouskateers."
IT'LL BE CUTE SEEING WHO  BACKS DOWN FIRST
"Tax the garbage, or, stop it"
"Retaliate back, don‚Äôt give in."

maple syrup has become a luxury item.
0:47 He kinda sounded like Trump there for a second. Ha ha.
Ole tough man trudeau hes petrified lol
5000% Tariff on hair gel
"And, so it begins. But then, with money raised on tariffs, perhaps we can go back to where the governments collect their taxes from the business transactions, and leave the individual pocketbooks in check. Sure, it raises prices but only on the products consumed. Perhaps people will go back to figuring out how to make their own food and alcohol, or rely on domestic products?"
drump needs to go away.   pew pew!!!! pew pew pew pew!!!!!  3rd time a charm baby!!!!!
This reaction of Trudeau is already taken in consideration by Trump and it is going as planned
BLUE STATES UNITE  JOIN CANADA
I thought Traudeau was gone!
"Thats cool, funny I've haven't' bought anything Canadian made in about 10 years so i think i'll be Okay..."

You need our stuff we dont need yours

He Really does take himself Seriously! Hes Funny! Pack Your Bags Already.

"Im moving out west, heard there is going to be a reversal in state ownership out there, texas, colorado new mexico, arizona, California, nevada and utah are ceeding back to mexico, returning home. "

Didn‚Äôt he resign?
Unfortunately this is a gift that fell right into Trudeau's lap... Bad timing!
Thought this fool resigned!
Seems only fair.
Maybe the doughnut  places will stop using that nasty maple frosting on half their stuff!
The only people who are complaining have purple hair and weigh 300 pounds. FACT!
Thank you Canada.  I'm an American that did not vote for Trump.  We have no power to make changes here.  Perhaps your tariffs will make Trump voters wake up and see exactly who they voted for.
so the great north armerican trade war has started ye.
Pfft‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt need Canada  bye 
Oh nooooo. We will see how that plays out.

thought trudeau resigned.
I think it's fair for Canada to respond this way. It wouldn't be fair for Canada to have to pay huge tariffs and not have America see the same treatment.
"Ay Hoser! Guess who doesn't need your paltry ""trade""?"
I thought he resigned already
hahaha  Little Taylor Swift boy is angry. LOL
"Ok, so where does this tariff money go?
Does it go to relief for those who now pay extra?
Does it go to relocating offshore companies to the USA?
The public needs to demand transparency on where this money is applied as it may be many years of paying extra before US companies spring up to replace the imports‚Ä¶at least naturally.
Tell me the tariff money immediately helps a Chinese factory relocate here and employ Americans, or that an American company is granted this tariff money to start up a replacement.
So far it‚Äôs just pay more, and have that extra returned to the US governments.
Basically a backdoor tax."

"This is all Cheetos fault!!!
Sorry Canada "
US imports more products from Canada than Canada does to US.  US consumers will suffer more.  US industry will profit.  Tarriffs just keep America dollars in the US but doesn't mean it's cheaper!  Means the US consumer will cover the extra cost. Basically the consumers in the US will pay the extra cost that US companies need to stay profitable vs Canadian.

"Hey Trump supporters.
I've heard Trump say today that Canada doesn't have anything we need.
If that is the case, WHY does he insist he wants to make Canada the 51st state?
Doesn't make any sense to want a place that doesn't have anything we want or need to become part of this country.
Sorry, I'm just using Common Sense here. I understand that is a difficult thing for some people to do, but I can't figure out why he wants to make Canada a state if they would only be a burden to us.
Can someone explain to me why he would want that?"
THIS IS SO PETTY! PLEASE PEOPLE WE NEED TO HELP EACH OTHER!
Looks like American civil war 2

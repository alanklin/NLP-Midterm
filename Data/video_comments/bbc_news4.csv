Trump has always been about ""America First"" and shut down USAID to stop 'unneccessary' spending overseas, yet here he is suggesting the US pays billions to redevelop an area the size of Manhattan island - what happened to paying for homes for homeless American war veterans?

UK exports of steel are less than 3% of our total production. Aluminium exports are negligible for the UK. This will have little effect on the UK. Germany on the other hand will have 10 billion dollars worth of tariffs, if this is applied as a blanket tariff on all steel. Basically, everything made out of it will get more expensive in the USA. Americans will be poorer. The American government will be richer.

Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs Once we get back to Made in America this will not affect Americans 
Federalist Papers 
Author: Alexander Hamilton`
In America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imports, and from excises, duties on imported articles.  In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties.

Those who attempt to bash or dismiss Hamilton and the time frame he lived in, are only attempting to separate you from your history.

Additionally, China needs to change its behavior to remove the following tariffs:
- 10% on Fentanyl trafficking,

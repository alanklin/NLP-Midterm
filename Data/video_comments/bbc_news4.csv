Trump has always been about ""America First"" and shut down USAID to stop 'unneccessary' spending overseas, yet here he is suggesting the US pays billions to redevelop an area the size of Manhattan island - what happened to paying for homes for homeless American war veterans? Why isn't that being spent on Americans?

So, wait a minute, steel works are a strategic industry, and allowing china to destroy it with cheap imports would be strategic madness. And we have allowed our steel works, in the UK, to be destroyed. But trump is the mad one?

I'm not quite understanding the reasoning here.

UK exports of steel are less than 3% of our total production. Aluminium exports are negligible for the UK. This will have little effect on the UK. Germany on the other hand will have 10 billion dollars worth of tariffs, if this is applied as a blanket tariff on all steel. Basically, everything made out of it will get more expensive in the USA. Americans will be poorer. The American government will be richer.

Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs Once we get back to Made in America this will not affect Americans 
Federalist Papers 
Author: Alexander Hamilton`
In America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imports, and from excises, duties on imported articles.  In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties.

Those who attempt to bash or dismiss Hamilton and the time frame he lived in, are only attempting to separate you from your history.

16,I think it's interesting how quiet the UK has been considering Canada is part of the Common Wealth and the threat to Canada's sovereignty from the US.
17,American here. MOST OF US DONT SUPPORT TRUMP! Juat saying this so the world doesnt give up on us and supported the people fighting against Trumpism cause we need support rn.
18,I wonder if these reporters think he's nuts but they are too nice to say 
19,I don‚Äôt get why more people aren‚Äôt talking about 'Forbidden Path for Achieving Wealth' ‚Äì it‚Äôs something you need to know
20,We all know these tariffs will last only a couple of days...
21,"It's hilarious that he slaps sanctions on everyone as a punishment, then put tariffs on all goods coming into his own country, effectively sanctioning himself."
22,"Trump has always been about ""America First"" and shut down USAID to stop 'unneccessary' spending overseas, yet here he is suggesting the US pays billions to redevelop an area the size of Manhattan island - what happened to paying for homes for homeless American war veterans? Why isn't that being spent on Americans?"
23,"EU will react against ""unlawful"" US tariffs, says European Commission."
24,In America we also tax if you say aluminum differently
25,"This book really opened my eyes, has anyone else read 'Forbidden Path for Achieving Wealth'?"
26,He is going to a dictatorship 
27,"This will be GRAND.... wasn't this tried in 2019? ah who cares lets try it again... 
I am still laughing, people said Trump wouldn't set back USA a decade."
28,Ho hum  so this domestic USA tax is paid there. Damaging for their car industry‚Äôs etc.   Still is the Gulf of Mexico btw.
29,"So, wait a minute, steel works are a strategic industry, and allowing china to destroy it with cheap imports would be strategic madness. And we have allowed our steel works, in the UK, to be destroyed. But trump is the mad one?

I'm not quite understanding the reasoning here."
30,I don‚Äôt understand this ‚Äúwhich he renamed the Gulf of America‚Äù nonsense. Trump doesn‚Äôt have any control over how the rest of the world refers to a body of water.
31,How many blast furnaces are still working in the UK?
32,The Gulf of America is the void located under that ugly mass of combover!
33,bbc asking about tarrif on aluminium and steel in air force one and trump cannot understand sarcasm

36,"Delighted to say I'm favoured over $100k every 4 weeks thanks to my portfolio manager. I now have few properties and can afford anything and also support my family, if you want to be successful, have the mindset of one, invest more and spend less, glad I understood that."
37,American cars and trucks will be a lot more expensive.
38,Now the BBC is just a bunch of characters with huge microphones in their garages?
39,From a US Citizen our Google Map now says Gulf Of America  this is crazy..
40,The rest of the world only knows that aluminium not that stupid spelling of it so we're okay to still send it without tariffs!
41,BBC seems to be short on reports today.  Must be all that lack of USAID funding 
42,"From my Canadian URL Google maps says Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America). Same when I switched my VPN to the UK, America, Russia, Netherlands and other European countries."
43,Trump just assumes world leaders suffer from Coulrophobia.
44,Google has now changed the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America on its maps 
45,Uk your tariffs are coming this week
46,Trump gets elected on a platform of lowering taxes and ....imposes a tax which is called a tariff 
47,"UK exports of steel are less than 3% of our total production. Aluminium exports are negligible for the UK. This will have little effect on the UK. Germany on the other hand will have 10 billion dollars worth of tariffs, if this is applied as a blanket tariff on all steel. Basically, everything made out of it will get more expensive in the USA. Americans will be poorer. The American government will be richer."
48,
49,"What borders on stupidity?

Mexico and Canada"
50,It would help if you could say Aluminium if you want to sell it. This maybe the problem?
51,Stop reporting on America!! They elected him we elected Labour. Focus on the shenanigans in Westminster.
52,"Musk calls German Green Party's candidate for chancellor ""a piece of shit"
53,More BBC wokey meltdown.

55,Crash is coming in metal stocks 
56,4:15 and what of it? 
57,"From the BBC, NYT and Politico ... at this point it might be easier to find out who USAID has NOT funded in the media sphere"
58,Anyway. Britiah politicians getting big pay rise while the working class get poorer and their hard earned cash is sent abroad.
59,"trump adds tarrifs ""why are we short on everything?!?!"""

62,Un sinkable is sinking now... & it's very timidly weakestTimidly.
63,Meet the fake news.
64,the Trumpus is reading mein kampf every night
65,I'm worried more about the fallout from Irans nuclear reactor that's only good for weapons grade uranium enrichment.
66,Last time you said America was going to go broke now we have Mexico and Canada securing their side of the boarder which is all he was asking for to begin with
67,"The most misinformed comments section I've seen in a while. This is bad, even for a BBC audience."
68,"Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs Once we get back to Made in America this will not affect Americans 
Federalist Papers 
Author: Alexander Hamilton`
In America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imports, and from excises, duties on imported articles.  In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties.

Those who attempt to bash or dismiss Hamilton and the time frame he lived in, are only attempting to separate you from your history."
69,in Thule America were about US we own that area British Columbia were doing natural law
70,Gr8 tash
71,"Good. Americans would rather buy American. Next!
Cough, cough. There are NO American vehicles manufactured in America.  They are ALL assembled in America.
Which is why tariffs will work."
72,Don‚Äôt make Trump crazy about these things Don‚Äôt try Trump to not  plunge his self and others but by the joint consultations apply these tariffs so all the economies benefit from it not applying the tariffs unilaterally as a retaliatory economic counter trade measure.
73,Buy US steel asap
74,Yes because hamas owns it now.  You think we just want to rebuild it for Hamas?
75,After reading 'Forbidden Path for Achieving Wealth' I finally understood why so many people struggle with money it reveals things most people don‚Äôt even know about how money really works has anyone else read it
76,You guys in the uk have tariffs on us this is just us leveling with you in the UK stop tariffing us an we'll stop terriffing you

A huge runny 5h!t."

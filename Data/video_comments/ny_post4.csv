1 - Tariffs will be paid by American importers 
2 - Price of Canadian goods will rise for US consumers
3 - Consumer demand for Canadian goods will decrease
4 - Canadian business will suffer

That's why it will hurt Canadians.

Canada offers friendly prices to the Americans, oil is sold cheaper to the Americans, electricity is sold cheaper. To understand the stupidity of the tariffs, here is an example: aluminum is manufactured in Quebec by an American company Alcoa, it pays a very preferential rate below the market price for electricity for Canadian companies. Alcoa sends the aluminum in bulk to be machined in the United States, then the Americans manufacture finished products ""automobiles, finished products that they sell to the whole world and to Canadians"". After this, you are told anything by your president and do not even think about the consequences. Americans make your aluminum at a higher price and increase your rates for finished products and pay more if that is what you want. Long live the American inflation of Donald Trump.

You  all really don't get it do you. so a foreign company selling its product in america has a 25% tariff imposed. Its not going to just eat that loss its going to raise the price of that product and have the consumer (americans) cover the loss.
 Then we'll just buy american, right? Why would the american counterpart keep their prices low? If all the foreign products prices have risen by 25% whats to stop the american company from raising their prices by 15-20%, their prices would still be lower then the foreign product but it would be a net price increase across the board... companies are all about making money.
 This is actually a tax on the american consumer using foreign products as the middleman. if the government raises taxes we pay directly to the government. here, the government is taxing foreign products so the government will get its money. the foreign companies will get their money by raising prices and in the end  the american consumer will pay the bill.

There we go higher tariff for importation  higher prices for the consumer and  if you want to bring  manufacturers in to the country you will  have to import supplies and if you want to produce it here you will have to bring foreign cheap labor so raising tariff will only make the consumer pay more way to go MAGA.

As an Albertan, Canadian, I really hope it‚Äôs not being placed on our oil‚Äîfor the sake of both our populations. If it is, gas prices at the pump will skyrocket in the United States, and we‚Äôll have to find another buyer since the U.S. currently purchases 80% of our oil. Might as well make Alberta the 51st state!

Meanwhile, we‚Äôre being held hostage by our liberal prime minister while our parliament is in prorogue. Instead of addressing Trump‚Äôs concerns about our immigration and border policies, Trudeau is sitting idle. Canadians are demanding an election, yet now, with these tariffs, our government is claiming we‚Äôll be in an emergency situation. And guess what that means? The Emergency Act back in place once again. Remember the truckers? Another excuse for the current Liberals to stay in power. 

It‚Äôs asinine to most Canadians why we won‚Äôt simply firm up our borders and immigration policies or just buy more from the U.S. The U.S. has a much larger population than Canada, and if there‚Äôs a small discrepancy in our trade, all we have to do is buy more from the U.S. to balance it out. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has a solution‚Äîmost of Canada‚Äôs oil and gas comes from Alberta, and nearly all of Alberta‚Äôs production is exported to the U.S. Instead of playing politics, we should be securing our economy.

With this promised tariffs being in place as of today, the much anticipated reduction in the price of most essential commodities of everyday life, will certainly not happen, but rather, it will skyrocket to the utter disappointment of the ordinary people who have expected a gross reduction in the cost of living following Trump's victory; resulting in a decrease in prices of everyday commodities.

Trump is concerned about the potential risks to Canadian borders that may eventually bleed at the Canada / US border. It's the largest border and if Canada doesn't properly vet and process immigration, it is a gap with the US. This already happened with International student, who had bad intentions going into the States. Simple...Canada and the US are in a unique position to control legal access into North America and Trump is looking at the larger picture - just put pieces together.

U. S. Citizens will actually pay those tariffs.  Duh "
why are the tariffs way less on china than on mexico or canada?
"For those who don't really understand it, are to pig headed or proud to admit it to anyone. I want you to type ""how tariffs work"" in that search box at the top of your YouTube window no one will know you did it and you don't have to tell on yourself but at least understand it, that's it."
Great bc as a small business owner that‚Äôs really gonna help me  some of my supplies are only made in China. I can‚Äôt get them here.
Can't wait for my money to have even less power than it does now.
"If Mexico and Canada have ALLOWED the drugs in, So too has the U.S.!!!"
So we are tearing up the NAFTA?
"‚Äú10s of millions‚Äù‚Ä¶

Bro, don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs A LOT, several 100k, but 10s of millions would‚Äôve reshaped our entire country and demographic numbers."

"Canada offers friendly prices to the Americans, oil is sold cheaper to the Americans, electricity is sold cheaper. To understand the stupidity of the tariffs, here is an example: aluminum is manufactured in Quebec by an American company Alcoa, it pays a very preferential rate below the market price for electricity for Canadian companies. Alcoa sends the aluminum in bulk to be machined in the United States, then the Americans manufacture finished products ""automobiles, finished products that they sell to the whole world and to Canadians"". After this, you are told anything by your president and do not even think about the consequences. Americans make your aluminum at a higher price and increase your rates for finished products and pay more if that is what you want. Long live the American inflation of Donald Trump."
Make America Pay Again
They should put higher tariffs on China üá∫üá∏
It's like a bad movie with casting of horrible actors but it's sadly real life. RIP American democracy 8/2/1776 - 1/19/2025
"Well, get ready to pay more America. Promises made Promises kept! And people waited after the election to Google, what a tariff was. SMH!  But at least the billionaires will be OK.  Well, let‚Äôs just hope your SNAP benefits were restored.  "
Canadians import 17 % from the US while the Americans import 75 % from Canada . Who do you think is going to pay for this ?
Most of you have no idea what's gonna happen.
"You  all really don't get it do you. so a foreign company selling its product in america has a 25% tariff imposed. Its not going to just eat that loss its going to raise the price of that product and have the consumer (americans) cover the loss.
 Then we'll just buy american, right? Why would the american counterpart keep their prices low? If all the foreign products prices have risen by 25% whats to stop the american company from raising their prices by 15-20%, their prices would still be lower then the foreign product but it would be a net price increase across the board... companies are all about making money.
 This is actually a tax on the american consumer using foreign products as the middleman. if the government raises taxes we pay directly to the government. here, the government is taxing foreign products so the government will get its money. the foreign companies will get their money by raising prices and in the end  the american consumer will pay the bill."
It‚Äôs a great time to be American. It‚Äôs about time! I haven‚Äôt felt this content with being American since probably 1996.
Nice of Trump to make the start of the 2025 depression a date that's easy to remember.
As a Canadian put any set tariff amount you like on Canada. It doesn't affect me just the other Canadians.

Now I can finally afford my fentanyl. Thanks President Trump!!!!!!!!!!!
"A few moments later...threats made , promises broken"
Great... looking forward to paying 10-25% more for... everything
Stop the lies
does the president of Mexico still think the Don is joking? 
Congratulations maga. You just made groceries way more expensive!
"Did the White House press secretary just say tens of millions of Americans passed away from fent. I just looked it up and it‚Äôs no where close to that ‚Ä¶and I mean no where. Where do these folks get these numbers? Btw, why aren‚Äôt any of the reporters in the room calling out the b.s."
America first or get out!!!!!
All CANADIANS!!! The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) transports oil from the biggest US oil field in Alaska through Canada to the US other US states. Would be a waste if something happened to that pipeline. 
buying nothing from USA anymore until this gong show is over..
He told us what he was going to do. One politician that keeps his word. LOL
"Canada and Mexico should consider common sense approach to do everything they can to stop being conduit of drugs smuggling, and route for illegal immigrants. That is the east they can do for the mighty and generous United States. Long live President Trump."
Why is your China receiving a 25 percent terrifyingly as well?
Thank you PRESIDENT Trump!
"She took off her big golden cross and not much has changed. She is still a liar and a hypocrite

Lying lips are an Abomination to the Lord - Proverbs 12: 22"
There we go higher tariff for importation  higher prices for the consumer and  if you want to bring  manufacturers in to the country you will  have to import supplies and if you want to produce it here you will have to bring foreign cheap labor so raising tariff will only make the consumer pay more way to go MAGA.
"All firearms in canada are from USA, illegal immigrants also cross-border from USA to Canada, USA should put more effort in the northern boarder too,  why only blame Canada."
Prices going up thanks maga clowns
"As an Albertan, Canadian, I really hope it‚Äôs not being placed on our oil‚Äîfor the sake of both our populations. If it is, gas prices at the pump will skyrocket in the United States, and we‚Äôll have to find another buyer since the U.S. currently purchases 80% of our oil. Might as well make Alberta the 51st state!

Meanwhile, we‚Äôre being held hostage by our liberal prime minister while our parliament is in prorogue. Instead of addressing Trump‚Äôs concerns about our immigration and border policies, Trudeau is sitting idle. Canadians are demanding an election, yet now, with these tariffs, our government is claiming we‚Äôll be in an emergency situation. And guess what that means? The Emergency Act back in place once again. Remember the truckers? Another excuse for the current Liberals to stay in power. 

It‚Äôs asinine to most Canadians why we won‚Äôt simply firm up our borders and immigration policies or just buy more from the U.S. The U.S. has a much larger population than Canada, and if there‚Äôs a small discrepancy in our trade, all we have to do is buy more from the U.S. to balance it out. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has a solution‚Äîmost of Canada‚Äôs oil and gas comes from Alberta, and nearly all of Alberta‚Äôs production is exported to the U.S. Instead of playing politics, we should be securing our economy."
"With this promised tariffs being in place as of today, the much anticipated reduction in the price of most essential commodities of everyday life, will certainly not happen, but rather, it will skyrocket to the utter disappointment of the ordinary people who have expected a gross reduction in the cost of living following Trump's victory; resulting in a decrease in prices of everyday commodities."
"Argentina tried high ""tariffs"" on foreign imports, and all it did was make things more expensive for Argentines... and Americans wonder why the world thinks they are dumb..."
"Why are americans consuming fentonyl not prescribed by their physicians? If there is no consumer demand, there would be no market for supply. Fix that."
Watch the effect of tariffs on prices of houses here in the UsA. Some lumbers will come from Canada. And UsA lumber producers can also increase their prices if demands increase. This is just one  example. I will hold onto my money and just buy necessities.
Curious as to why 10% on China and not MX and CA instead?
He won't put tariffs on Canadian oil because America needs it
"Americans
Take your cars to the gas station today and fill up.  If the tariff includes oil, you will be paying about $1.00 more for every gallon of gasoline and diesel fuel."
He's not as dumb as he looks. A lot of companies were setting up plants in Mexico and Canada to export to the US. Now they will have to build those plants in the US.
I like the new press secretary! Clear & concise.
"Remember, putting tariffs on another country makes the foreign producer pay the tax, while domestic products get cheaper and more competitive.

Tariffs = you need to act right
Smart lady - can we get one in England please?
What ever we have to do ! Go Trump!
Up go consumer prices.  Trump inflation!
"The government needs money, this is the best way to get it and Americans like it even they will pay the tariffs themselves later when they purchase the imported goods. Does it make sense smart people?"
"Trump is concerned about the potential risks to Canadian borders that may eventually bleed at the Canada / US border. It's the largest border and if Canada doesn't properly vet and process immigration, it is a gap with the US. This already happened with International student, who had bad intentions going into the States. Simple...Canada and the US are in a unique position to control legal access into North America and Trump is looking at the larger picture - just put pieces together."
Lets go!
I thought the Congress was has the power to tariff...   and the President can only really do so in certain circumstances-- like at Wa r or negotiating Mutual a Trade agreement(s)??
When will Operation Maple Syrup start?
"TRUMP SUPPORTERS REMEMBER: When the tariffs drive up your prices, you were here on the internet arguing that they wouldn't. I'll be curious to see what you'll blame this time."

After doing nothing at the start of the great depression the US Government then decided to apply tariffs to all countries. this made the great depression last longer because all those countries applied tariffs on the US. What is that expression about history repeating itself. Funny he did not mention this the 1930s.

World trade decreased by about 66% between 1929 and 1934.
US imports and exports: US imports decreased 66% from 1929 to 1933, and exports decreased 61%. 

Trade wars ensued from the tariffs, decreasing exports and imports. That was from a simple google search. Maybe these tariffs will lead to the next FDR to clean up the mess.

Higher Costs for U.S. Manufacturers
 • Automakers and tech companies suffered due to higher costs for steel, aluminum, and components used in production.
 • The higher cost of raw materials led companies like Harley-Davidson and General Motors to shift some manufacturing overseas.
 • Electronics, machinery, and consumer goods became more expensive, raising costs for businesses and consumers.

The Great Depression & Smoot-Hawley Tariff (1930)
 • The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act imposed high tariffs on imports to protect American jobs, but it exacerbated the Great Depression by triggering global retaliatory tariffs, shrinking international trade.
 • Other nations raised their tariffs in response, reducing U.S. exports and worsening unemployment.

Do like cheap oil?  Do you need critical minerals? Canada will look to sell its products to other markets and exclude the US market.  Its already happening.  The US dollar in comparison to the Canadian dollars is $1 to $1.39.  Just in the exchange value the US is getting a good deal.

Canadian here. We love our American neighbours but this 25% tariff is Trumps first mistake since being back in office. These tariffs are proving to not be fentanyl and immigration related now. Canada makes up for under 1% of that issue and is 1/10 of Americas population. We have had Americas back for decades and Trump needs a brief history lesson on this. In a few months we'll have a better leader to work with the White House, so a little patience until then is needed. Pierre Pollievre also wants to drill baby drill. Until then, all customers on both sides of the border will feel this unfortunately.

Devastating Impacts on U.S. Farmers
 • Soybean farmers suffered massive losses, as China (the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans) shifted its purchases to Brazil.
 • American agricultural exports to China fell by over 50% in 2018, leading to record bankruptcies among U.S. farmers.
 • The U.S. government had to bail out farmers with $28 billion in subsidies, making up for lost sales.

One of the most devastating tariffs in recent years was the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods (2018-2019) as part of the U.S.-China trade war. These tariffs, initially aimed at reducing the trade deficit and protecting American industries, had severe unintended consequences, particularly for farmers, manufacturers, and consumers.

Important historical context missing here: While the 1920s tariffs did coincide with economic growth, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 had devastating effects. It triggered retaliatory tariffs worldwide and caused global trade to drop by ~65%. This trade war made it much harder for countries to recover from the Depression, as other nations couldn't earn dollars to buy US goods or pay their debts. Yes, prices went down during Smoot-Hawley, but that was because demand collapsed and unemployment hit 25% - not a good thing! The 1920s boom had many causes beyond tariffs: mass production, consumer credit, electricity, and automobiles transformed the economy. Today's globalized economy is very different from the 1920s, so we should be careful about drawing direct parallels.

Can we also please recognize that deflation means your house value like other prices also falls and then people expect it will fall some more so they wait longer to buy and it continues to fall and before long you are stuck in a house you can't sell without taking a loss just like in 2008-2012 financial crisis? Also of course no one wants to lend you money for anything because it might end up cheaper tomorrow so that's higher risk and if they lend you anything it will be with a steep interest rate premium. So then your past debt becomes even more expensive and since no one is enthusiastic about stable or higher prices in the future the economy slows down. Read up on Japan's in the 90's ya'll before you try to bring this on intentionally. He may force the feds hand into lowering interest rates at that point to stabilize things, but doing it this way will be years of pain. Again, ask Japan, the impacts of that period are still felt today.

At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, and pass the cost to American consumers.

It was the government’s lack of interest in the gold-dollar matter of the 1920s, a symptom of which was the sustained increase in prices, that caused the stock-market mania to begin with. Government then, in the early 1930s, stepped in with its tariffs, taxes, confiscations (of both gold at the federal level and property at the state and local level—the foreclosure crisis), and spending increases, and thereby chased away the real economy. The void left over was the Great Depression.

You left out a lot of facts. Tariffs have been here for 136 years.. The Tariff Act of 1789 imposed the first national source of revenue for the newly formed United States. In 1922 it authorized the  president to raise or lower a given tariff rate by 50% in order to even out foreign and domestic production costs. Between 1861 and 1933, the United States had one of the highest average tariff rates on manufactured imports in the world.

Tariffs are a tax on consumers. Trump needs the tariffs to replace the money lost in the tax cuts for the very wealthy. The tariffs are just a money transfer from the poor to the wealthy.

Also to note. In the 70’s-80’s American business men didn’t realize the power of the semi-conductor, so they basically told Asian countries to bother with this “useless” tech. Why we are just starting to make chips on a grand scale thanks to the chip act. But also to note that the largest chip maker in the world and in America is from Taiwan.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act raised the price of imports to a point that they became unaffordable for all but the wealthy. Plus, it dramatically decreased the amount of exported goods contributing to bank failures; particularly in agriculture-strong regions of the time.

When pointing out deflation occur during the 1930s, he's basically making a conclusion that it was due to tariffs. No, deflation occurred during the 1930s because of the collapse of our banking system which led to extreme decline in money supply.

I like how the FOX News graphics department included from various sources arntion of the Great Depression, but Charles Payne only referred to the time period as the '30's. Plus he uses roughly 30 seconds of the entire segment quoting Thucydides to say more or less that he is going to tell you the complete truth which is, well.... wait for it... far from the truth.

This segment titled, ""The Facts...,"" if everything is more or less an accurate and trying to show select data to ""prove"" something that's not true.

That is not the whole truth. What about the great depression?

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is widely considered a major policy mistake that deepened the Great Depression.  By significantly raising tariffs on thousands of goods, it triggered retaliatory tariffs from other nations. This drastically reduced international trade, crippling American exports and shrinking markets for U.S. businesses.  The decreased demand for American goods led to factory closures, job losses, and further economic decline.  While other factors contributed to the Depression, the tariff wars initiated by Smoot-Hawley worsened the economic downturn and made global recovery much more difficult.

The deflation of the 1930s that's casually glossed over here was due to the unprecedented wave of bank failures and the wiping out of deposits, thereby reducing the amount of money in circulation.

So it wasn’t just a low level of inflation (which, if kept within a certain range, is manageable); it was full-blown ""deflation"" (negative inflation), which is an entirely different beast that depending on its severity, can be downright catastrophic.

And to make matters worse, the US Federal Reserve, rather than increasing liquidity and expanding the money supply, responded by tightening monetary policy, triggering a loss of confidence as people hoarded cash instead of spending or depositing it, further restricting money circulation.

So in reality!!! the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 which jacked up U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, was not a good thing. In fact it's been acknowledged by practically every serious economic historian as being the single most disastrous policy blunder in US history, which ended up pouring fuel on the already-burning wreckage of the Great Depression.

The primary reason? Beyond the obvious inflationary squeeze of higher domestic prices, these tariffs provoked immediate and brutal retaliation from other nations! The result was that Americans got slapped with higher costs on not just their imports, but on their exports as well, in addition to having to deal with the spectacular collapse of most international trade.

And the world’s economy suffocated as most US domestic investors along with all foreign venture capital crap-shoot speculators vanished into thin air. And this choked the domestic and international money supply, which intensified the crushing deflation that defined the 1930s.

Any historian that knows anything about economics and has at least half a brain, will tell you that the Smoot-Hawley Act was protectionism at its most self-destructive. It was a policy disaster of epic proportions that made a terrible situation catastrophically worse.

And this Fox News clown and Trump economist is suggesting that these Tarrifs were the best thing America ever did since the invention of the light bulb. And furthermore, that everyone apart from him is simply too ignorant to realise this, because of course he's read a quote in a history book by Thucydides. God bless the liberal arts curriculum. 

Yes indeed, you really do have to admire Charles Payne for starting off his analysis by quoting Thucydides from his history of the Peloponnesian War: ""Most people in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth from politically unbiased, serious economic historians, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear from some two-bit Fox News shock-jock business analyst, who doesn't know the first thing about economics.""

As a Canadian these tariffs are a real wake up call to re-evaluate our relationship with the U.S. as it’s clearly not working out. I think we should start exploring deals with other partners like China. If we sign a free trade deal with them we could greatly increase our trade with them and reduce our trade with the U.S. which also reduces the trade deficit. Then we can sign a strategic military agreement like NORAD with China meaning we can leave NORAD and NATO saving the Pentagon billions annually!

Tariffs help keep our economy strong by encouraging us to buy American-made products. When foreign goods are taxed, it gives local industries a fairer chance to grow and compete, which means more jobs and higher wages for U.S. workers. eventually lower costs in the long run

Alan Greenspan is an expert on the Great Depression I've never heard him mention or anyone credible else that tarriffs lead to The Great Depression. It was described as roaring 1920s or over consumption, stock market crash and a bubble, which was dipicted by the movie The Great Gatsby, which when the bubble burst it led to bank runs, which every modern financial documentary covers with those old black and white films. During the 2008 crash where it is said we came close to crash like 1929, again it is described as a financial crash, nothing to do with tarriffs. As for inflation, price rise isn't inflation, we know it is too much money chasing to few goods or expansion in the money supply or cheap money and credit. A price on those goods which have been tarrifed, only pushes up the price of those goods but not goods that carry no tarriff.

I like the idea of tariffs along with increase energy supply making it cheaper, corp tax cuts, deregulation. I am concerned that if wages do not keep up it will end up with a huge surplus of goods which will be bad, and banks will fiddle with the numbers. Also a big reason why we had a depression in the 30's is because farmers went out of business due to the dust bowl, 1930-1936.

What was the impact of McKinley's  tariffs on daily lives? 
chatGPT: William McKinley was a strong advocate for protective tariffs, and his policies—particularly the McKinley Tariff of 1890 and later the Dingley Tariff of 1897—had significant economic and social impacts on daily life in the U.S.:
...
Political & Social Reactions
    Increased Cost of Living Led to Backlash: The rise in consumer prices angered many, contributing to a Republican loss in the 1890 elections.
    1893 Panic & Economic Downturn: Though not solely caused by tariffs, the economic strain, along with bank failures and high unemployment, intensified criticism of protectionist policies.
    1896 Election & Tariff Adjustments: When McKinley became president, he introduced the Dingley Tariff, further increasing protection for industries but reinforcing high consumer costs.

Long-Term Impact
    McKinley’s tariffs shaped future trade policies, setting the stage for ongoing debates about free trade vs. protectionism.
    They contributed to the economic divide between industrialists (who benefited) and farmers/laborers (who struggled with higher costs and trade restrictions).

Larry Kudlow: Trump is absolutely right about this tough tariff diplomacy
Fox Business
183K views 13 days ago"
""
"If you have advanced financing, thank you Jesus, a beneficiary of $32,000, sourced from an economical situation."
Did he just skip over the Great Depression?
"So, are we just ignoring the Great Depression being the reason why there was deflation?"
"2:40 conveniently not showing the great depression of the 1930s I see, thanks for the history lesson!"
The economy now is very different than a century ago. Please factor that in and stop yammering absurdities. These tariffs will be paid by American citizens.
Fox is the last place to go for facts.
"Tariffs are a Tax, Companies Not Countries Pay The Tariff Tax, That TAX is often passed along to the consumer."
"This was the craziest crash course on economics I have ever seen. Forget the gilded age where workers and average joe's were destroyed, bypass the depression, etc. This is gold. He should teach economics at Liberty or Oral Roberts.. hopefully not a real school."
I just wanted to see Fox's take on the tarriffs.  More bull.
What happened to the US farmers after Trump's tariffs? They lost so much money that the US government has to subsidize them billions dollar.
"The great depression followed those tariffs, genius"
"Such BIG, BEAUTIFUL gaslighting Chuck! Your alternative facts are impressive."
Fox buisness is definitely in someones pocket....
So we're not going to connect tariffs in the 20s to the depression in the 30s?
"That is why I can’t watch much FOX.. no Great Depression, I think that is what Trump wants to bring back."
After doing nothing at the start of the great depression the US Government then decided to apply tariffs to all countries. this made the great depression last longer because all those countries applied tariffs on the US. What is that expression about history repeating itself. Funny he did not mention this the 1930s.
"World trade decreased by about 66% between 1929 and 1934.
US imports and exports: US imports decreased 66% from 1929 to 1933, and exports decreased 61%. 

Trade wars ensued from the tariffs, decreasing exports and imports. That was from a simple google search. Maybe these tariffs will lead to the next FDR to clean up the mess."
"Higher Costs for U.S. Manufacturers
 • Automakers and tech companies suffered due to higher costs for steel, aluminum, and components used in production.
 • The higher cost of raw materials led companies like Harley-Davidson and General Motors to shift some manufacturing overseas.
 • Electronics, machinery, and consumer goods became more expensive, raising costs for businesses and consumers."
Tariffs going to make inflation skyrocket for us  americans and China and Canada going to put tariffs back on the use
"I was pro Right and Pro Trump. But imposing tarifs on our closest allies, especially Canada is absolutly absurd."
This is the first time I ever heard someone amped up on the Great Depression. Making it sound like it was a grand ole time  I guess since you told me first how wonderful it was I believe it. 
"The Great Depression & Smoot-Hawley Tariff (1930)
 • The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act imposed high tariffs on imports to protect American jobs, but it exacerbated the Great Depression by triggering global retaliatory tariffs, shrinking international trade.
 • Other nations raised their tariffs in response, reducing U.S. exports and worsening unemployment."
Do like cheap oil?  Do you need critical minerals? Canada will look to sell its products to other markets and exclude the US market.  Its already happening.  The US dollar in comparison to the Canadian dollars is $1 to $1.39.  Just in the exchange value the US is getting a good deal.
"Canadian here. We love our American neighbours but this 25% tariff is Trumps first mistake since being back in office. These tariffs are proving to not be fentanyl and immigration related now. Canada makes up for under 1% of that issue and is 1/10 of Americas population. We have had Americas back for decades and Trump needs a brief history lesson on this. In a few months we'll have a better leader to work with the White House, so a little patience until then is needed. Pierre Pollievre also wants to drill baby drill. Until then, all customers on both sides of the border will feel this unfortunately."
This guy has no clue wha he is talking about. The Great depression was also called the dirty 30's an I rememeber  my grandfather telling storys of soup kitchens men traveling on top of box cars going to the next city looking for a job. Because their were no jobs. He lost his farm in the west came east with the family an work as a hired hand on farm lived in a cold shack with only a wood stove to keep my grandparents and my mother and sister warm. It wasn't till the start of World war 2 things were booming an got back on his feet.
"The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, later expanding to $200 billion in goods.
 • China retaliated with high tariffs on U.S. exports, particularly on soybeans, pork, and automobiles.
 • The tariffs raised costs on key products like steel, aluminum, electronics, and machinery, impacting American businesses."
It's fkn comedy gold watching Fox try to spin these trade wars into a positive thing.
"The law simple: ""Tariff what you make, dont tariff what you dont"""
He just cherry-picked a bunch of information. Please people do your own research
"""This is gonna be the greatest depression ever, absolutely YUGE"" "
"Burden on Consumers
 • Studies found that nearly 100% of tariff costs were passed on to American consumers.
 • Everyday products, from appliances to smartphones, became more expensive, costing U.S. households an estimated $1,300 per year."
Educate is freedom  no more lies.
"i always felt like i was stuck in the same cycle—watching other people manifest their dream lives while i kept getting the short end of the stick. no matter how much i tried, nothing seemed to work. then i picked up Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, and something clicked. it made me realize i had been doing everything backwards. after a few weeks of applying what’s inside, things started changing fast. my confidence, my money, even the people around me. it’s honestly crazy."
This guy is freaked out. You can hear it in his stuttering voice. He doesn't even believe the diarrhea coming out of his mouth
Next up: Lung cancer causes smoking.
This guy is so underrated. I have never known Payne's economic predictions to be off.
"It happened 100 years ago, so it’s sure to happen now? Absolutely foolish."
Stop calling them TARIFFS and start calling it the TRUMP TAX.
substantial tariffs = costs passed onto consumers = higher prices = higher interest rates
"That was also when the us didnt depend in other countries, now other countries can put tariffs on the us"
"So Fox is saying things will be great by Christmas for the USA.
Will the people from fox place a wager on this?"
"Tell Me How Elon Musk getting more tax breaks helps are roads, healthcare, He Benefited from our Immigration commng from South Africa"
"Stability is a result of our economy's struggles with uncertainty, housing issues, foreclosures, global volatility, and the pandemic's consequences. To restore stability and promote growth, all sectors must respond quickly to concerns about growing inflation, slow growth, and trade disruptions."
"Lol. Smoot-Hawley wasn’t deflationary, the Great Depression was. Failed to mention that part."
🇺🇸FIGHTFIGHTFIGHT 🇺🇸
A country had cheap labor? he forgot to mention back in History the US had free labor as his ancestors were working day and night in handcuffs and shackles 
This guy thinks it's 1921 the world is a totally different place this is what to expect from a propaganda network.
"Back then, we were in the Industrial Age! We had the infrastructure and the resources to meet the domestic production needed! We don't have that now, nor do we have the interest in corporate America to sacrifice high salaries among executives in order to hire more labor!!!"
The roaring 20's..... followed by?????
The wonderful period of deflation he referred to was the Great Depression. Which followed those high taxes of the Roaring 20’s. There are so many holes in his Swiss cheese.
What did you buy in 1920?
Thanks for talking about US history to US Citizens 🇺🇸️️
"Devastating Impacts on U.S. Farmers
 • Soybean farmers suffered massive losses, as China (the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans) shifted its purchases to Brazil.
 • American agricultural exports to China fell by over 50% in 2018, leading to record bankruptcies among U.S. farmers.
 • The U.S. government had to bail out farmers with $28 billion in subsidies, making up for lost sales."
lol I like how the chart ended right before the Great Depression.
"One of the most devastating tariffs in recent years was the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods (2018-2019) as part of the U.S.-China trade war. These tariffs, initially aimed at reducing the trade deficit and protecting American industries, had severe unintended consequences, particularly for farmers, manufacturers, and consumers."
We need tariffs on Canada … no way we can compete with those guys !  
I hope Trump supporters get everything they voted for
"Yeah, 25% unemployment really helps get prices down. Great Depression 2.0 here we come."
"Except that we are not living in the 1920s no more.  This is 2025.  Ever hear about emerging markets?  The bottom line is this:  Any consumer, and especially American consumers, want the best deal at the lowest price."
Thank You Charles!🇺🇲
By the end of this video the s&p 500 went red  LOL
Basically expect higher prices.
"No Significant Trade Deficit Reduction
 • Despite the tariffs, the U.S. trade deficit with China remained high, proving that tariffs alone could not shift global supply chains quickly.
 • Many companies absorbed higher costs or moved production to other countries (like Vietnam), not back to the U.S.."
"Wasn't the 1920s and 1930s called ""The Great Depression""?"
"FUN FACT: in a tariff war, the consumer pays the bill ….."
That’s what I’m talking about 
Yep let's all cheer the depression will soon be here !  I never expected to comedy on fox Business.
"Tariffs will Keep the Money Home.  Thank you Mr. Green.  Then the US will be able raise the pay scale, lower taxes, while raising the standard of living."
%200 tariffs on USA . Go Canada 🇨🇦#1.
Have fun with that tRump tax at Walmart MAGAts 🫵
Happy inflation americans
"lies lies lies , tariffs are the worst thing for the average Americans making less than 100k"
Extraordinary deflation spiral a.k.a. the Great Depression… you forgot to mention that Chucky.
This guyy is so full of B.S anyways.  Especially you fox news.
Did you just tell everyone to ignore all other financial media? Are you going to start burning books next?
"The stock market has little correlation with the economy. Show us the P/E ratios. Tariffs started the first great depression. Keep your alternate revisionist history crap out of here!
Factory workers cost $40k per year in wages PLUS $50k per year for benefits. Private health insurance handicaps American manufacturing. The only way to make American manufacturing competitive is universal healthcare."
"Important historical context missing here: While the 1920s tariffs did coincide with economic growth, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 had devastating effects. It triggered retaliatory tariffs worldwide and caused global trade to drop by ~65%. This trade war made it much harder for countries to recover from the Depression, as other nations couldn't earn dollars to buy US goods or pay their debts. Yes, prices went down during Smoot-Hawley, but that was because demand collapsed and unemployment hit 25% - not a good thing! The 1920s boom had many causes beyond tariffs: mass production, consumer credit, electricity, and automobiles transformed the economy. Today's globalized economy is very different from the 1920s, so we should be careful about drawing direct parallels."
"Charles are you saying Tarrifs caused the Great Depression, because the Depression is what caused low prices in the 1930's."
"Wooow. This is absolutely shocking that charles is being allowed to say this on fox news, a major US news network... that we cant have our economy solely focused 100% of the time, live and die by quarterly earnings reports.. that's corporate blasphemy to say out loud.. glad he said it"
"There are rumors here in the European Union that if Canada takes steps, the European Union will also do so. Ursula von der Leiden said in an interview the day before yesterday that the world doesn't need America, we can get by without them. so that could be a party"
"I keep telling people, we need to do critical thinking.  Focusing on the short term ramifications of decisions is what is hurting this country."
Fox Business is quoting Thucydides.  Im impressed.  Classical education is underrated.
That's great! We get the roaring 20's and then the 1929 crash. I guess I'll enjoy it. 
We voted for tariffs and BIG BEAUTIFUL tax cuts ! USA USA USA 🇺🇸
Trump had 8 years to explain tarriffs. He’s a poor communicator when it comes to stuff like this.
2:13 I love how his first example were roaring twenty economic policies that inevitably led to the worst depression in the country 
"I am at the beginning of my ""investment journey"", planning to put 385K into dividend stocks so that I will be making up to 30% annually in dividend returns. any good stock recommendation on great performing stocks or Crypto will be appreciated.."
Mark my words this will be the end of trump people are not going to spend 25% more on basically everything hopefully
Globalization was definitely as pertinent an issue as today
So you totally gonna ignore the great depression of the 1930's which was caused by those tariffs? Prices went down because nobody was buying anything because nobody had any money to buy things.
"Can we also please recognize that deflation means your house value like other prices also falls and then people expect it will fall some more so they wait longer to buy and it continues to fall and before long you are stuck in a house you can't sell without taking a loss just like in 2008-2012 financial crisis? Also of course no one wants to lend you money for anything because it might end up cheaper tomorrow so that's higher risk and if they lend you anything it will be with a steep interest rate premium. So then your past debt becomes even more expensive and since no one is enthusiastic about stable or higher prices in the future the economy slows down. Read up on Japan's in the 90's ya'll before you try to bring this on intentionally. He may force the feds hand into lowering interest rates at that point to stabilize things, but doing it this way will be years of pain. Again, ask Japan, the impacts of that period are still felt today."
That was 100+ years ago. You cant possibly compare the two. My god
What ignorance 
"As an Australian, you guys vote for this & good luck American, you're paying more stuff "
"The Wall Street Journal, which is not generally considered some left-wing rag, released an article titled ""The Dumbest Trade War in History."""
"Consumers will pay more for needed items. If not needed then less desired at the higher prices. 
Businesses should get the dtaje amount of profit considering Anerican Billionaires started the China Mexico thing to make more.
Government tariif tax should he huge. Which should affect education and health care but won't.  Pals of politicians should do fine as usual. 
Voters will pay more but they say only $80 a month. 
Maybe that's by buying less."
Didn’t the Smoot-Hawley Tariff get blamed for making the Great Depression worse?
Everyone should educate themselves on the Hawley Smoot Tariff Act.
Thanks for educating the uninformed. The problem is the uninformed can not be taught to see beyond their ingrained thought processes even when wrong
So basically tariffs caused the great depression?
Those tariffs led us into the Great Depression!
"Ignore financial media outlets? That's kind of like look at the tourist in the rotunda, not the beat down of the police and ransacking of the capital."
"The problem with deflating our currency now is it's too far gone. Many people are going to be pinched hard when it comes. Since Smoot, the US Dollar has been devalued over 93%."
Now I understand the DEI issue and I agree that's reverse discrimination against competent white men and women.
Classic Fox. Trump does something? It’s great no matter what he does. Throw logic out the window. So if guy is right why don’t we put 50% tariffs on every other country we trade with?
"Who would have thought, there was no inflation during the depression? Tariffs and the country was only in a deflationary collapse - lower prices, sign me up! Thanks for the lesson Fox!"
Federal tax break and tarrifs will be a wash. Other countries will also devalue currency to deal with tarrifs. Much needed thank you Mr.President.
im betting cost go up!!!!
"If trump thinks he can do the same thing Hoover did and end up with a different result, he's nuts. Hoover's ""short term pain"" lasted 25 YEARS."
Anti taxers for tariffs!!  These people really are a joke 
I love to pay more 
"At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, and pass the cost to American consumers."
I want more things made in America 🇺🇸 
I love how he brings up the 1930s and prices dropping but that was during the great depression. So of course prices were going to drop because money was not circulating whatsoever because the entire economy crashed.
In other words let's all pay more!
This is truly insane. Nothing is the same as over a hundred years ago. Half the people stilled live on farms a hundred years ago! In an integrated economy with your North American neighbours you are only hurting everyone. You are moving to a lower standard of living.
"love how it says it helped the ""top tier Americans"""
"It was the government’s lack of interest in the gold-dollar matter of the 1920s, a symptom of which was the sustained increase in prices, that caused the stock-market mania to begin with. Government then, in the early 1930s, stepped in with its tariffs, taxes, confiscations (of both gold at the federal level and property at the state and local level—the foreclosure crisis), and spending increases, and thereby chased away the real economy. The void left over was the Great Depression."
One Problem. Things change and we are no longer in the 1920's.
"Oh yes, the roaring 20s. The party that never ended. XD"
"This is some wild spin. Put up some charts and point to ""line goes up"" and then say ""see, everything that every economist has said is not true. Actually, its the exact opposite!""
Wild times"
"We’re past the point of talking about it. Since it’s such a great idea, let’s see what tariffs do to prices on imported goods. These people clearly think companies are just gonna eat that cost.."
"You left out a lot of facts. Tariffs have been here for 136 years.. The Tariff Act of 1789 imposed the first national source of revenue for the newly formed United States. In 1922 it authorized the  president to raise or lower a given tariff rate by 50% in order to even out foreign and domestic production costs. Between 1861 and 1933, the United States had one of the highest average tariff rates on manufactured imports in the world."
Anybody who has played vic 2 knows that definition of protectionism is wrong
"""Hoover pockets"" ....  ""waving the flag""...  But if Tariffs will lower housing.. I am for it!"
Trump's Golden age is another way to say gilded age. We all know what followed.
Shame on you America
I agree with you! Great video!
Tariffs are a tax on consumers. Trump needs the tariffs to replace the money lost in the tax cuts for the very wealthy. The tariffs are just a money transfer from the poor to the wealthy.
"Hoover, the Economic Hero, said no one."
It's true.  Disrupting $2.2 trillion in trade is great for America!  Thanks Fox news!
"Also to note. In the 70’s-80’s American business men didn’t realize the power of the semi-conductor, so they basically told Asian countries to bother with this “useless” tech. Why we are just starting to make chips on a grand scale thanks to the chip act. But also to note that the largest chip maker in the world and in America is from Taiwan."
What a toll on the Alcan/Alaska highway through Canada??
Tariffs shrink the government. That’s the point.
Someone bookmark this video. Let see how well this ages if Trump really goes all in on tariffs. I also love how this guy also essentially just said “ignore those with financial acumen or expertise.”
Wow please tell me Charles isn’t what the average intelligence level of reporters.  Your using the Great Depression as your example?  Holy crap what a buffon.
It may be an idea if we actually produced something in America! Tariffs are what helped cause the depression
The only fact you need is that in order for Trump to give breaks to his oligarchs he will make it up from you the little people . Sqeezing everything he can from you.
"The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act raised the price of imports to a point that they became unaffordable for all but the wealthy. Plus, it dramatically decreased the amount of exported goods contributing to bank failures; particularly in agriculture-strong regions of the time.

When pointing out deflation occur during the 1930s, he's basically making a conclusion that it was due to tariffs. No, deflation occurred during the 1930s because of the collapse of our banking system which led to extreme decline in money supply.

I like how the FOX News graphics department included from various sources arntion of the Great Depression, but Charles Payne only referred to the time period as the '30's. Plus he uses roughly 30 seconds of the entire segment quoting Thucydides to say more or less that he is going to tell you the complete truth which is, well.... wait for it... far from the truth.

This segment titled, ""The Facts...,"" if everything is more or less an accurate and trying to show select data to ""prove"" something that's not true."
"That is not the whole truth. What about the great depression?

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is widely considered a major policy mistake that deepened the Great Depression.  By significantly raising tariffs on thousands of goods, it triggered retaliatory tariffs from other nations. This drastically reduced international trade, crippling American exports and shrinking markets for U.S. businesses.  The decreased demand for American goods led to factory closures, job losses, and further economic decline.  While other factors contributed to the Depression, the tariff wars initiated by Smoot-Hawley worsened the economic downturn and made global recovery much more difficult."
At least prices on bacon will go down️
Tariffs are socialism. I thought the GOP was for capitalism and free trade.
Let's not forget this led to 1929 depression.
"This way America could finally emerge as a self sustaining country, they have all the resources natural & man power, finally using it in order. Creators & innovators could come out from this momentous occasion. Happy for the actions, sometimes it takes unpopular actions to move on. There would be hiccups & challenges to start but in the long run, it's good for the country."
Omg!!!!! What happened after that we had the Great Depression!!!
"If you use tarrifs to lower income tax, people on lower incomes pay more, people on higher incomes pay less. Americans source a large proportion of their foods from Mexico.  Adding 25% at point of entry will increase your grocery cost. Its maths."
"The deflation of the 1930s that's casually glossed over here was due to the unprecedented wave of bank failures and the wiping out of deposits, thereby reducing the amount of money in circulation.

So it wasn’t just a low level of inflation (which, if kept within a certain range, is manageable); it was full-blown ""deflation"" (negative inflation), which is an entirely different beast that depending on its severity, can be downright catastrophic.

And to make matters worse, the US Federal Reserve, rather than increasing liquidity and expanding the money supply, responded by tightening monetary policy, triggering a loss of confidence as people hoarded cash instead of spending or depositing it, further restricting money circulation.

So in reality!!! the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 which jacked up U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, was not a good thing. In fact it's been acknowledged by practically every serious economic historian as being the single most disastrous policy blunder in US history, which ended up pouring fuel on the already-burning wreckage of the Great Depression.

The primary reason? Beyond the obvious inflationary squeeze of higher domestic prices, these tariffs provoked immediate and brutal retaliation from other nations! The result was that Americans got slapped with higher costs on not just their imports, but on their exports as well, in addition to having to deal with the spectacular collapse of most international trade.

And the world’s economy suffocated as most US domestic investors along with all foreign venture capital crap-shoot speculators vanished into thin air. And this choked the domestic and international money supply, which intensified the crushing deflation that defined the 1930s.

Any historian that knows anything about economics and has at least half a brain, will tell you that the Smoot-Hawley Act was protectionism at its most self-destructive. It was a policy disaster of epic proportions that made a terrible situation catastrophically worse.

And this Fox News clown and Trump economist is suggesting that these Tarrifs were the best thing America ever did since the invention of the light bulb. And furthermore, that everyone apart from him is simply too ignorant to realise this, because of course he's read a quote in a history book by Thucydides. God bless the liberal arts curriculum. 

Yes indeed, you really do have to admire Charles Payne for starting off his analysis by quoting Thucydides from his history of the Peloponnesian War: ""Most people in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth from politically unbiased, serious economic historians, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear from some two-bit Fox News shock-jock business analyst, who doesn't know the first thing about economics."""
Gangster diplomacy. Watch for Canadian spending and vacations in the US to plummet.
As a Canadian these tariffs are a real wake up call to re-evaluate our relationship with the U.S. as it’s clearly not working out. I think we should start exploring deals with other partners like China. If we sign a free trade deal with them we could greatly increase our trade with them and reduce our trade with the U.S. which also reduces the trade deficit. Then we can sign a strategic military agreement like NORAD with China meaning we can leave NORAD and NATO saving the Pentagon billions annually!
"Oh, so higher prices are okay now.  But when Biden has higher prices it's not okay.  We understand and will gladly pay higher prices now."
"Yes, prices will go down if you crash the economy and unemployment goes from 4% to 35%."
THE STOCK MARKET IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH RIGHT NOW! Let's see how quickly the new depression starts
"curious why did reagan, a true leader of the free world, beg canada to have a free trade agreement. anyone."
You forgot the Great Depression….. good luck Americans
He is not taking in to consideration the products we need to import because we DONT produce them in the US . Putting Tarrifs on those products serve no one .
"Tariffs help keep our economy strong by encouraging us to buy American-made products. When foreign goods are taxed, it gives local industries a fairer chance to grow and compete, which means more jobs and higher wages for U.S. workers. eventually lower costs in the long run"
This guy does not know anything about economics clearly. Let’s get excited about paying more money for imported goods
I work for a manufacturer of Ag and Industrial equipment. We haven't worked over 36 hrs in 6 months. I'm sure a trade war will solve everything. Keep spewing your BS and collect that million dollar salary you spin doctor
The Great Depression started in 1929. The reason prices dropped in the thirties is because of the. An economic recession or depression is deflationary at a bigger price than most will be willing to pay.
"Questions :  What was the rate of deflation? , and how long did it last?  ref 3:35"
"A tax on imports will be felt by consumers. The reality is tariffs will hurt all nations involved.  As long States don't depend on Canadian products like electricity anymore, I think it might be a plan. I am sure continuous brownouts throughout New York City will hardly impact the economy."
"Time will tell and it might be worth a try with U.S. tariffs in 2025 however the caveat here is what succeeded in the 1920s and 1930s may succeed in 2025 and it may not simply because we live in a much different world today, economically, socially, geopolitically and also corporate and consumer mindset more complex and diversified."
My question is we have more countries we depend on for goods..Is this the same as President Mckinley era?
"Using the stock market as some kind of gauge is just dumb. This is actually poor work when it comes to making the case for tariffs as you brrought the wrong case forward.  The great depression had nothing to do with tariffs, nor did inflation.  You also made the case inflation came way down...yeh it was a depression of course it did, and you don't want the same thing happening here lmao."
"Question? What was the level of global trade in the 1920s? And, was the US a major manufacturer and exporter back then?"
"Oh, don't ignore.... It is called ""do some research on your own."""
There r so many similarities between 1920 and 2025. And taxes r not going away and now prices r going up. Then the good times of the 1929.
Tariffs work if you have a manufacturing sector. Manufacturing was outsourced.
The roaring 20s ended in the great depression .... So...
I could be wrong but I feel like something was off with the world's economy from like 1929 through the late 30s due to tariffs and wealth inequality. I just have a feeling. Do your own research though.
"Alan Greenspan is an expert on the Great Depression I've never heard him mention or anyone credible else that tarriffs lead to The Great Depression. It was described as roaring 1920s or over consumption, stock market crash and a bubble, which was dipicted by the movie The Great Gatsby, which when the bubble burst it led to bank runs, which every modern financial documentary covers with those old black and white films. During the 2008 crash where it is said we came close to crash like 1929, again it is described as a financial crash, nothing to do with tarriffs. As for inflation, price rise isn't inflation, we know it is too much money chasing to few goods or expansion in the money supply or cheap money and credit. A price on those goods which have been tarrifed, only pushes up the price of those goods but not goods that carry no tarriff."
"I won’t agree with everything Trump does, this is one of those things."
Call this network in 6 months and tell them whether they were right or wrong.Then go on social medium and tell them also.
"MAGA, 1000%  on all countries. We Americans can have free rent, food, cars, and energy."
The comments are really flaming you guys lol . HOWEVER I appreciate your perspective as a democrat who likes to observe news from all sides .
Did he just praise massive deflation as something to be sought after by policy?
"Why do these young people always say 
""Right"" after every three or four words like they're trying to convince us what they're talking about? It's all word salad to me. "
Trump is a genius.
When McKinley was president our economy was not as global and the world economy was different. Trumps lack of understanding things is going to cause recession
The best taxes are tariffs
How about the price of eggs? Day one campaign slogan?  trump has forgot!
"i remember feeling like i was always the one fading into the background while others stood out effortlessly. it was frustrating and made me doubt myself a lot. then i came across this book, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, and it showed me things i’d never even considered. it’s not just a self-help book; it’s like a guide to understanding your own energy and using it to connect with people. if you’ve ever felt like you’re not seen, this book might change everything."
People listen to the first they hear. Introduce the roaring twenties and forget about the great depression.  Wait see...
US history started in 1920? US has had high tariffs since 1776 thats how the country got built.
"Yes lets shrink our government as our country grows in size, also while china is building and building and building....."
"When is all this going to help increase wages, bring down prices, and get us better, more affordable healthcare? This is what we voted for President Trump to do, and this is what he promised to do. Working-class America is struggling."
"""prices actually went down in the 30's you fools. Look at this stock market up, prices down""


I guess we left out the part about the great depression, lines at food banks, mass unemploymemt... Unless that's the plan "
I have $5.00 left over from payday. BRING IT ON!!!!!!!!!
Trump himself said itll be hard ffor the peoplefor a ehile but I dont think theyll mind.
We just gonna ignore the Great Depression then? Ok...cool
Price control when. Its the last step before total control of the economy.  Freedom Who?
Yes prices go down in a depression and recession 
100 years ago comparison is not the same. Products now travel 2 or more times through different countries. Times are more complex. Anyone can tell you this.
"I like the idea of tariffs along with increase energy supply making it cheaper, corp tax cuts, deregulation. I am concerned that if wages do not keep up it will end up with a huge surplus of goods which will be bad, and banks will fiddle with the numbers. Also a big reason why we had a depression in the 30's is because farmers went out of business due to the dust bowl, 1930-1936."
How does it feel to be the propaganda arm of the GOP?
 Trump Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump look up good old Don already crashing the stock market
Charles used to be unbiased . Those days long gone.
The fact that one has to go yhrouch the the mental gymnastics to go back 100 years to justify a policy is rediculous lol
DONALD DUCK TRUMP:IM GONNA MAKE AMERICA TRUMPFLATION AGAIN 🇺🇸
"i used to think success was all about grinding harder, pushing through, and hoping things would change. but no matter what i did, i kept running into the same roadblocks. then i saw a few people talking about Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, so i gave it a shot. i wasn’t expecting much, but the way it explains energy and alignment completely flipped my perspective. it wasn’t about working harder, it was about shifting my energy first. everything started flowing after that."
"i remember this one time i felt like no matter what i did, people just didn’t notice me. i tried everything—confidence boosters, social tips, you name it—but nothing seemed to work. then i found this book, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, and it completely shifted how i saw myself. it’s not just about being noticed; it’s about understanding the energy you project. honestly, this book made all the difference for me. if you’ve ever felt invisible, you need to read it."
"one night i was scrolling through my phone, feeling like i’d never figure out why some people just seem so magnetic. then i came across this book, Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, and something about it caught my attention. reading it was like turning on a light in a dark room. it’s not about pretending to be someone you’re not; it’s about unlocking the energy you already have. trust me, this book is worth every page"
The last I knew Canada Mexico China and the bunch of other countries have at least 100% tariff on our us goods going to their countries
Fox don’t make mistake cnn made. We want objective news not trump news.
He still hasn’t got a clue what a tariff is
Top tier spenders….the rich because minorities were struggling with that bullshxt
Glossed over the depression
“Ignore what you hear on financial media or anyone else”.      No. Don’t be a sheep. Absorb everything and draw your own conclusions. Sort through the bias whether it’s “left” or “right” and hitch your wagon to your own horse.

"What was the impact of McKinley's  tariffs on daily lives? 
chatGPT: William McKinley was a strong advocate for protective tariffs, and his policies—particularly the McKinley Tariff of 1890 and later the Dingley Tariff of 1897—had significant economic and social impacts on daily life in the U.S.:
...
Political & Social Reactions
    Increased Cost of Living Led to Backlash: The rise in consumer prices angered many, contributing to a Republican loss in the 1890 elections.
    1893 Panic & Economic Downturn: Though not solely caused by tariffs, the economic strain, along with bank failures and high unemployment, intensified criticism of protectionist policies.
    1896 Election & Tariff Adjustments: When McKinley became president, he introduced the Dingley Tariff, further increasing protection for industries but reinforcing high consumer costs.

Long-Term Impact
    McKinley’s tariffs shaped future trade policies, setting the stage for ongoing debates about free trade vs. protectionism.
    They contributed to the economic divide between industrialists (who benefited) and farmers/laborers (who struggled with higher costs and trade restrictions)."
It the stable genius 10 days to increase prices for americans.
"Well, if we're being honest here, deflation that lasts more than a few quarters is a really bad thing. See the Philipps Curve."
Dude that was the worst year in history The Great Depression started and later was  World War II everybody got drafted and went to War a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945
Trumps 8 trillion in deficits last term will be peanuts to what's he's going to do this round! It'll be funny watching the Trumper's blame Biden when prices skyrocket and the economy tanks 
His first statement and what he is saying started the depression in 1929. Google it.
This is not 1920's times have changed
"I pray you’ll aren't falling for this because we live in a modern digital world that requires electronics and all of the part are imported. 
You see when we just get cut out of global trade. This isn't the 1920s. Every other household has a fire arm and the population has never experienced mass unemployment and probably starvation; due to social mismanagement"
"Using the early 20s as a good economic model is like saying the Hindenburg had a nice takeoff. McCumber cost american agriculture its shirt. Unemployment was 8% in '30 when the Smoot–Hawley Act was passed and 16% in 1931 and 25% in 1932. Both imports and exports dropped 60%. 
Next time you ask an audience to research, try it yourself."
"Remind me again how the roaring 20s ended? Oh ya, the great depression. Mass unemployment."
HAAAAAAAAA LOOOOKKK HOW THEY trying to explain it

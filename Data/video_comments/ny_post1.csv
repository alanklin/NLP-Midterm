Many of China's older generations carry vivid memories of surviving on tree bark and dirt during harsh times, a collective memory the younger generations conscientiously preserve, While American counterparts came of age in an era of postwar abundance, enjoying carefree growth amidst economic prosperity and material comfort. So When times really get tough, Which one is most likely to collapse?

The United States dollar was established as the world's foremost reserve currency by the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. It claimed this status from sterling after the devastation of two world wars and the massive spending of the United Kingdom's gold reserves. Despite all links to gold being severed in 1971, the dollar continues to be the world's foremost reserve currency. Furthermore, the Bretton Woods Agreement also set up the global post-war monetary system by setting up rules, institutions and procedures for conducting international trade and accessing the global capital markets using the U.S. dollar.
europe and others let the world deal in us dollars

美国对于中国来说，关税伤害能力没有很大。美国只占中国总出口的%15 而且都是一些基础用品。我举个例子，比如之前我2美元的成本卖给美国，美国进口商再以2.5美元去卖给消费者。但是现在有关税了。那么两种方式 1 之前2美元的成本用材料更差的替代，变成成本1.5美元，仍然以2美元的价格卖给美国的进口商，进口商仍然按原价2.5美元卖给消费者（这种可能性很小） 2 之前2美元的成本，现在用材料更差的替代，变成1.5美元成本。为了增强竞争力还是会以2美元的价格卖给美国进口商，但是美国进口商会打着关税的幌子之前2.5美元，现在卖3美元。趁机涨价。所以中国和美国企业都没受到太大的伤害，美国民众受到很大伤害。会导致通货膨胀率进一步增高

President Donald Trump announced extraordinary new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China — signing the long-promised economic policy Saturday. The leaders of all three countries soon announced they would take retaliatory measures. A day after signing the tariffs, Trump acknowledged what economists and members of Congress  …

If groceries keep going up, I will apply for Gov food assistance.  If I can't get it, I try the Food Banks.  If that fails, I guess I will be homeless just to buy food.  Many like me are already on the edge.  This is insanity.

Not temporarily, one thing is certain. Prices will go up, manufacturing will slow down and unemployment will follow.  This is like Nancy Reagan's Just say no to drugs. Americans did not say no, they asked for more and even legalized some. Americans are in for a shock of their life for the next 4 years. Macroeconomics is a science not vudu.

Canada’s biggest mistake is leaving the 10% tariff on energy. Should have slapped a 15% export tax on oil.  Gasoline would go through roof for Americans.  Perhaps still up Canada’s sleeve.

The U.S. always boasts of ""protecting"" Canada. But the reality is that Canada has a very favorable geopolitical location that the U.S. can't really do anything about. That land, including the Arctic land masses, are now and will always be important to the United States for 3 reasons:

1. The Northwest Passage: With melting Arctic ice, a commercially important trade route will open and that will be very valuable to control. The north's answer to the Panama Canal. Currently it's controlled by Canada. 
2. Resources: oil, natural gas, metals and minerals of technological, commercial and military value, FRESH WATER...including undiscovered reserves in the Arctic 
3. The land could always become an adversary's military staging ground, particularly China and Russia, as they could easily come over the Arctic circle. 

So really the U.S. is protecting it's own interests by ""protecting"" Canada and will provide protection to that land no matter who lives there. They just don't want to live in a relatively frozen and desolate climate while they do their ""protecting"". Otherwise they would. Fortunately, their cousins the Canadian live there and administrate it in a way that is commercially beneficial to the U.S. and the Canadians themselves.

A Few Caveats
Complex Supply Chains:
Many products sold in the U.S. are assembled from components that may come from several countries. Even if a significant portion is imported from Mexico or Canada, only that portion might be affected by the tariff.

Price Absorption:
Manufacturers and retailers sometimes absorb part of a tariff (or adjust production) so that the full increase isn’t passed directly to consumers.

Market Factors:
Competition, brand positioning, and alternative sourcing might reduce or delay any direct price increases.

Estimates:
The prices listed above are illustrative examples based on current average prices. Actual price changes would depend on numerous factors including production costs, supply‐chain adjustments, and market conditions.

In Summary
If an everyday item that costs $X now is entirely imported from Mexico or Canada and faces a 25‑percent tariff, its price might be expected to rise to about $1.25×X. The examples above—from cars to a 6‑pack of beer or a gallon of milk—offer one way to visualize that impact.

Keep in mind these numbers are rough estimates intended to illustrate the potential effect of such a tariff on consumer prices.

I am amazed that Trump says the US doesn't need anything from Canada. It seems to me that if this is true, we should absorb the hurt and just go elsewhere. There are lots of places interested in goods from Canada. There are very few people who can suffer like Canadians. We will suffer to get out of an abusive relationship with the US.

Of course Americans WILL pay higher prices. That's precisely what tariffs are designed for. 90% of all aluminum, 80 %of all potash used to make fertilizer, 60% of all imported oil comes from Canada. 
Prices at the pump, up, prices for cars, up, prices for anything made from steel and aluminum, up. 
Americans PAY the tariff costs on IMPORTED goods. Fruits, vegetables and auto parts and cars from Mexico, up. 
If the automotive supply chain breaks, cars and truck plants STOP. ""Just in time"" supplies won't be there.

From Canada.. our response is just a warm up of what's to come. The dictator attacks his best friend and ally just so he can pay for his tax cuts of his friends (and himself of course) all on the backs of his trading partners and citizens. Well, if he goes any further, he'll get another punch in the nose (not literally) because that's how one deals with a bully. When we cut the oil, electricity and critical minerals for your military, maybe some of his cronies will finally wake up and convince him that this was a really bad idea to begin with. If he wanted to negotiate the trade agreements, all he had to do was ask, but you don't threaten right out of the gate when there is no reason for it. His numbers he preaches as an excuse are all false narratives.

One thing these pundits don't mention is how this will affect businesses that sell to Canada and Mexico outside of costs.

As of today, we have put our apartment in NYC up for sale, and we are cancelling our trip to the US in October. We feel we can not travel and spend money in a country under Trump. Even here at our local bottle shop, they are saying there has been a backlash on US-owned alcohol companies, and my work friend's husband works at Tesla here and has mentioned they are having lots of cancelled orders. interesting way to make the USA great.

It is not a question of fentanyl or illegals at the northern border. It is not also Canada badly treating the US. It has all to do with Trump’s goal to increase fiscal revenues in order to pay for the income tax break. Trump really thinks he can solve the US deficit by raising tariffs on all nations exporting to the US. If he is right, that would be the miracle the US needs to get out of its huge debt. however, he can push the US and the world into a deep recession and push the US into a fiscal abyss.

You don't have to be an economic guru to figure out that tariffs doesn't solve anything. And for anyone that claims to bring prices lower, thinking that tariff won't affect inflation, it's not thinking right. I just hope these 4 years go by quick, and some other person becomes president from either party, and undo this mess.

On Fox Business, they're gas lighting viewers about tariffs, telling them that tariffs are a great thing that will bring in all kinds of revenue, and cite the roaring (19)20's as an example of high tariffs during economic expansion. Fox Business omitted the Great Depression, which resulted from a decade of protectionism and trade barriers, and gas lighted their viewers by omitting that tariffs are paid by Importers and consumers - not the foreign exporter.

Do you have any idea how pissed we are up here?  Our government doesn't need to put tariffs on U.S. products to get Canadian consumers to put goods exported from the U.S. last in our purchase decisions.

In this world there are MANY enemies of the American Republic both within and without, domestic and foreign. The Canadian people at large however, are NOT among them. Indeed, Americans have no single greater ally on God's green Earth, than they do in Canadians. The truly alarming part to me as a Canadian with deep American family and roots, is not merely the out-of-thin-air tariff and its questionable justifications; it's the widespread aggression and even anger that many Americans now seem to have in support of it. I agree with most of what President Trump has done so far in his short second term...but on this issue, I honestly believe we are watching the formation of a cult of personality that should give any clear, logical, rational thinker a reason to pause.

As a Canadian, I need to say I have always considered Americans as great people and our friends. I still feel that way. However, we cant sit idly by while the current president tries to destroy our economy. I dont suppose Americans really have a way to know what is taking place right now north of the border at the ground level. Everywhere I go here in our city, all I hear from people is - what can I replace in my purchases both long and short term with some product other than American. Literally dozens of people we know, have cancelled their travel plans in the USA. We have taken 14 assorted cruises in the Caribbean and USA. Every one of them had stops in or originated in the USA. That is over, we will now travel in Europe or the far east. This really has Canadians upset and mobilizing to avoid spending money as much as they can in USA. Personally, I feel Florida, Mr Trumps home state will be one of the hardest hit areas over this - not only from Canadians, but from Mexico and other countries who holiday there as well. Sorry Americans, I wish it didnt have to be this way but we cant just sit and take it. And if we do act in the proper responsible way, seeking out suppliers from other countries - and actively, for the first time in decades, seeking markets in other countries than US, what Americans may give up in a trade war in the way of our resource rich raw materials, and in markets for their goods, once we find alternatives, you will likely lose forever.

The same people who are saying we shouldn't put tariffs on corporations outside of the USA because it's inflationary are always calling for higher corporate taxes inside of the USA. If tariffs are passed on to consumers then what makes them think corporate taxes aren't also be passed on to consumers? The fact is, corporations don't have unlimited pricing power and they DO have to absorb a large amount of the cost. Why else would importers be trying to stockpile ahead of tariffs? To save money for the consumer? I don't think so. And why would a country protest those tariffs they could simply pass all of the cost to American consumers? Low tariffs on overseas corporations and high taxes on USA corporations is an America Last policy and Trump is taking action to reverse that.

Don't forget about them student loans that are coming out of forbearance from block and pause by the courts on top of the exponential amount of increase in food and groceries and gas and oil changes, car parts, or a gallon of milk to be put on blast by local media. The short term memory is astounding!

Yes, tariffs will raise prices. That's kind of the point. The goal is to raise prices to a point where it costs less to manufacture in the US than overseas. This will bring manufacturing back to the US and raise the median household income because manufacturing jobs pay better than the ""service industry"" jobs people are currently doing. The reason why we're targeting Canada and Mexico is to specifically bring automobile manufacturing jobs back to the US. These jobs left the US when NAFTA became law. The goal is to repair the damage done by NAFTA.

The easy way to understand tariffs is that they are essentially sales taxes on everything that is tariffed. Generally, the consumer will pay the tariff, or in some cases more, as if it is a raw material it will cost more as an input and profit margin will apply.
Also, generally, domestic suppliers raise their prices to match those of the tariff-added import. 
Finally, tariffs have a bigger impact on poor and middle-class people than the wealthy.

I love Canada but from my perspective Tariffs were necessary to wake us up and for our greater good (many will disagree but we all can have a difference of opinion!). Unfortunately misplaced patriotism is being whipped up because no one cares for Common Canadians. Where were these politicians for last 2 years when grocery chains, banks, auto makers etc were price gouging us and increasing their profits? They raised the bogey of supply chain issues, never allowed outside chains to come in and held us ordinary Canadians hostage. Inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. Where did excess money come from? Only immigration? Grocery chains and alcohol producers made big profits without allowing inter provincial movement of goods, while we struggled with taxes, food and rent, so really who cares about  tariffs? Trump will force us to allow foreign companies to come here, excess internal supply will be diverted to us, hence less money will chase more goods, hopefully driving down prices.  The main downside is loss of jobs but companies were anyways silently laying off people last year under the radar so that will continue. I think we need something like this to wake up our politicians, who are hand in glove with corporate Oligarchy. No offence to anyone!

Mexico, remittances will be way down because of deportations, goods wont be sent to the us over the boarder which will result in layoffs. Americans may see an increase in vegetable prices and unavailability of some items to purchase.

Every year in the USA around 100.000 people die of drug addiction (and related health problems). Very, very sad situation !  My sincere  condolences to the families involved!

... BUT:

- If it weren't fentanyl it would be some other drugs (heroin; other synthetic drugs, etc. ), at least partly.

- To think Trump gives a damn about 100.000+ us drug addicted is laughable.

- To think that tariffs (especially toward Canada and Europe where fentanyl is almost unknown) would solve the problem of us citizens with drug addiction is laughable.

The tariffs implemented by THE FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION  TO BRING  BACK TO THE USA JOBS (LESS THAN 3000 IN TOTAL & MOSTLY LOW LEVEL FACTORY JOBS), COSTED TO THE US AMERICAN TAX PAYER A SUM IN EXCESS OF:  ""800.000 US DOLLARS EACH"" (PAYED IN TARIFFS). THE US FARMERS EXPOSED TO COUNTER-TARIFFS (SOYBEAN PRODUCERS) HAD TO BE SUPPORTED (AND STILL ARE TO THIS DAY)  WITH 100+ millions US DOLLARS PAYED WITH INCOME TAXES (...ON YOUR INCOME FOR EXAMPLE) . MEANWHILE, CHINA MADE LONG TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH BRAZILIAN FARMS.

- 2024 IS THE 100 YEARS ANNIVERSARY OF THE REMOVAL OF THE ""PITTSBURGH PLUS"" TARIFF GUESS BY WHO? - THE GOP .

- THIS ATTITUDE  WILL SPUR THE DECISION OF BRICS COUNTRIES TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT CURRENCY, IN SUBSTITUTION OF THE US DOLLAR,  AS AN UNDERLYING CURRENCY FOR MOST RAW MATERIALS CONTRACTS (OIL; IRON ORE; COPPER; GOLD ; SILVER; ETC ETC. ). THUS COMPROMISING US AND WESTERN DEMOCRACIES SUPPLY CHAINS CONTROL.

THIS USELESS, COMPLETELY USELESS, TRADE WAR WILL AFFLICT  THE AVERAGE CITIZENS AND DAMAGE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WESTERN DEMOCRACIES FOR YEARS TO COME.

For all of those arguing with the tariffs. 

Yes both country citizens will hurt in the short term but imo will be better for long term. For Americans, go to the government census website on trade between US and these countries. We import BILLIONs more than they import from the US and have for years. We are supporting their economy significantly more than they are helping ours. Evening out the balance sheet has to be done at some point. 

You can’t argue with the discrepancy although I do wish he didn’t take such a harsh action.

the only way to make inflation go down is back to basic, supply and demand. make more supply, increase production, increase efficiency and more.
that way the price will come down, nice and smooth

this increase tariff only hurt economy, every time price increase they never go down again

If anyone is curious, you may be saying “why is he doing this? And why now!?”….(at a time when Americans are already struggling..) The answers are simple to me. It’s because he HAS to fix inflation for one, and two he’s determined to place tariffs. Unfortunately the two don’t mix…Not to mention….he will want to get elected for a third term. So, he has to do the tariffs now so that it he has time rebound and to try fixing inflation before “re-election”. This way he still gets all 3. He gets his tariffs, he gets his “I fixed it moment, and then his cult re-elects him a third term…

The other possible plan b is, that he keeps doing these new laws and making changes until the left breaks out in violence. He then declares marshal law, squashes the rebellion/violence and then he suspends constitution. Boom, he’s a full blown dictator. 

These are my worst case scenarios essentially.

It's wild to me that CNN doesn’t understand the laws of economics. Supply and demand. Removing people from this country decreases the supply and the demand, but decreases the demand far more than it decreases the supply. Removing federal workers and benefits from those on welfare, but are perfectly capable of working reduces our liabilities and increases the labor pool. The majority of these newly unemployed laborers will take jobs that create new supply. Tarrifs contribute to this new supply and job pool by forcing companies to make their product in America. It's already working with Canadian companies.

This is ultimately NOT true, but it depends on how things turn out.
    These tariffs could majorly shify how and what products are sold here in America.
    The only way it could be bad is if people keep buying products and using services that could very well be made and used here inside the U.S. from other countries.
   If executed correctly, thes tariffs could force a HUGE bloom of jobs in the U.S. Allow buisness inside the country to flourish and bring back real value back to the American dollar. 🇺🇸

Canada still has a free trade deal with CUSMA's partner, Mexico and we also a free trade deal with the European Economic Union. Trump has threatened tariffs against it as well as the UK. Canada may have become over reliant on the US marketplace as a place to sell our goods but we can also sell elsewhere.

How do Americans not understand what tariffs are and how they as consumers will be on the paying end of them? It's wild how Americans don't understand the most basic information, it has to be explained to them like this and then they still don't get it

Canadian here. Canada buys what it wants from the US. The US buys what it needs from Canada. An important difference. Trump should pray Canada doesn't block electricity and oil exports.  Good luck, America. Life is about to get a lot more expensive.

Canada should respond by introducing a 125% export tariff on energy and other critical exports to the US. 
Recognising Trump's professed love for tariffs, Canada shouldn't let the hard work of raising tariffs fall solely on Trump & Co. Instead, in the spirit of friendship and cooperation, and as a sign that Canada wishes to share the administrative burden of tariffs, it should have an equivalent export tariff for anything that Trump is introducing tariffs on. The 125% export tariffs on energy being a goodwill gesture to show that Canada is willing to go above and beyond!

I am Canadian and strongly believe we should close the border completely... No oil no electricity no this and that... We will stand up to a bully
It's way more disgusting when you realize some of the richest people on Earth (the new American Oligarchs)  are telling the average American to bear the pain and the price!
"If groceries keep going up, I will apply for Gov food assistance.  If I can't get it, I try the Food Banks.  If that fails, I guess I will be homeless just to buy food.  Many like me are already on the edge.  This is insanity."
The guy who never pays for anything says paying more is worth it.
The tariffs have absolutely nothing to do with drugs or migrants.
I can't believe people believed that he would lower prices on day 1. Presidents don't set grocery prices. You just can't be that stupid.
Canada should shut off the electricity to us 10 minutes before the Super Bowl starts.
"Americans dont have experience how this works. One prices go up, they never go back down.
Good luck from Argentina.  Land of inflation due to tariffs"
"If the US has an import/export deficit, ask yourself why the rest of the world does not want to buy your stuff as much as you want to buy their stuff."
"Been reading social media from across Canada, Mexico, Europe, etc. Folks across countries that used to be close allies of the US are boycotting American products and travel. And people have long memories. Just these boycotts of Trump and MAGA will hurt the US economy for a generation or more"
It's a tax...and the US consumer will pay it.
This is what happens when you put a fool in the white house.
As Mike Bloomberg said back in 2016: “Trump says he’ll run the economy the way he ran his businesses. God help us!”
If it wasn't for Trump voters I would have thought Trump to be the dumbest person on earth.
I must say that this time I felt very proud to be Canadian
"Not temporarily, one thing is certain. Prices will go up, manufacturing will slow down and unemployment will follow.  This is like Nancy Reagan's Just say no to drugs. Americans did not say no, they asked for more and even legalized some. Americans are in for a shock of their life for the next 4 years. Macroeconomics is a science not vudu."
Oh right. He also promised to end the Ukraine war in one day.
"People do not seem to understand. It is the people of the country imposing the tarrifs, that wilm pay the tarrifs."
Canada’s biggest mistake is leaving the 10% tariff on energy. Should have slapped a 15% export tax on oil.  Gasoline would go through roof for Americans.  Perhaps still up Canada’s sleeve.
"People, stop saying the tariffs may raise prices.  They will without a doubt.  Tell it like it is."
Why are you saying “could” raise prices? It 100% WILL. Stop being vague.
"This is what you voted for. Blame yourself, for once."
"I voted for Kamala Harris.
My conscience is clear.."
"The U.S. always boasts of ""protecting"" Canada. But the reality is that Canada has a very favorable geopolitical location that the U.S. can't really do anything about. That land, including the Arctic land masses, are now and will always be important to the United States for 3 reasons:

1. The Northwest Passage: With melting Arctic ice, a commercially important trade route will open and that will be very valuable to control. The north's answer to the Panama Canal. Currently it's controlled by Canada. 
2. Resources: oil, natural gas, metals and minerals of technological, commercial and military value, FRESH WATER...including undiscovered reserves in the Arctic 
3. The land could always become an adversary's military staging ground, particularly China and Russia, as they could easily come over the Arctic circle. 

So really the U.S. is protecting it's own interests by ""protecting"" Canada and will provide protection to that land no matter who lives there. They just don't want to live in a relatively frozen and desolate climate while they do their ""protecting"". Otherwise they would. Fortunately, their cousins the Canadian live there and administrate it in a way that is commercially beneficial to the U.S. and the Canadians themselves."
" just to be clear.... when these prices creep up, they generally stay up. it becomes the new norm"
America IS about to be tested like NEVER before in history
In his first term he wrote this trade agreement. So if it was so unfair why did he agree to it the first time. It just don't make sense.
"Fellow Americans:   Are you all ok with Elon Musk now having all our social security numbers, bank accounts, personal information, the government's databases?   All good with Musk controlling the country's checkbook?"

A Few Caveats
Complex Supply Chains:
Many products sold in the U.S. are assembled from components that may come from several countries. Even if a significant portion is imported from Mexico or Canada, only that portion might be affected by the tariff.

Price Absorption:
Manufacturers and retailers sometimes absorb part of a tariff (or adjust production) so that the full increase isn’t passed directly to consumers.

Market Factors:
Competition, brand positioning, and alternative sourcing might reduce or delay any direct price increases.

Estimates:
The prices listed above are illustrative examples based on current average prices. Actual price changes would depend on numerous factors including production costs, supply‐chain adjustments, and market conditions.

In Summary
If an everyday item that costs $X now is entirely imported from Mexico or Canada and faces a 25‑percent tariff, its price might be expected to rise to about $1.25×X. The examples above—from cars to a 6‑pack of beer or a gallon of milk—offer one way to visualize that impact.

Keep in mind these numbers are rough estimates intended to illustrate the potential effect of such a tariff on consumer prices."
MAKE AMERICAN PAY AGAIN
I am behind you Canada . Rick from the USA
"Canadians already hated HIM way before he announced tariffs.
Now..."
"""Follow the money"" to see which of his billionaire buddies will benefit from being able to increase their prices by 25%.

This has nothing whatsoever to do with illegal drugs!"
"I am amazed that Trump says the US doesn't need anything from Canada. It seems to me that if this is true, we should absorb the hurt and just go elsewhere. There are lots of places interested in goods from Canada. There are very few people who can suffer like Canadians. We will suffer to get out of an abusive relationship with the US."
"How long has our government been trying to stop drug use? The war on drugs hasn't, won't and can't work if you don't curb the demand. That ain't happening in a country whose citizens LOVE their drugs."
"Tell Americans about how the price is avocados is so much higher than the price of the thousands of lives lost to fentanyl. CNN, America is learning just how much disdain Democrats have for them thanks to you. Great job"
about 1% or less of illegal immigrants and fentanyl has entered the us from Canada.  The tariffs are not about solving problems they are about indirectly taxing Americans and dismantling free trade.
I am paying the price with the Trump tariffs already.  My crypto holdings dropped 25 percent in one day.  Get this lunatic out of the white house ASAP.
"as a canadian, why even start a trade war ?? I like having american friends and not being attacked online by americans threatening my sovereignty  .... it makes no sense. Hopefully america still will look at canada as a friend in the future when trump stops this crazy shit"
America needs a wake up call that they are not centre of world and this is wake up call for Canada to find new trade deals
"25%tax on aluminum. Most of the aluminum used in the US is imported from Canada. Beer and soda prices will rise.
25%tax on nickel. Nickel is necessary for stainless steel and numerous other things including batteries."
"Of course Americans WILL pay higher prices. That's precisely what tariffs are designed for. 90% of all aluminum, 80 %of all potash used to make fertilizer, 60% of all imported oil comes from Canada. 
Prices at the pump, up, prices for cars, up, prices for anything made from steel and aluminum, up. 
Americans PAY the tariff costs on IMPORTED goods. Fruits, vegetables and auto parts and cars from Mexico, up. 
If the automotive supply chain breaks, cars and truck plants STOP. ""Just in time"" supplies won't be there."
"From Canada.. our response is just a warm up of what's to come. The dictator attacks his best friend and ally just so he can pay for his tax cuts of his friends (and himself of course) all on the backs of his trading partners and citizens. Well, if he goes any further, he'll get another punch in the nose (not literally) because that's how one deals with a bully. When we cut the oil, electricity and critical minerals for your military, maybe some of his cronies will finally wake up and convince him that this was a really bad idea to begin with. If he wanted to negotiate the trade agreements, all he had to do was ask, but you don't threaten right out of the gate when there is no reason for it. His numbers he preaches as an excuse are all false narratives."
"Please do note, ONCE THE PRICE IS UP, IT WILL SELDOM GO DOWN."
"🇨🇦Canada is removing all American alcohol from the shelves in stores, well done Donald."
Is anyone else starting to wonder if Trump is insane?  None of this makes rational sense...
"Looking at the US Bureau of Statistics, under the Consumer Price Index, one can notice that in the last quarter of last year, stocks are not really doing well, especially energy stocks as they seem to be below the zero point. However, I don't know if stocks will quickly rebound as I have no clue the direction of the market. Can I get an advice on any other stocks that I can acquire to diversify my reserve of $300k across multiple markets while creating a comprehensive portfolio."
"Saw video of Canadians yelling at each other in stores, ""don't buy anything American, don't be a traitor!"""
Red states enjoy the tariffs !
From fixing it in a day to pain. Thanks Donnie!
Oh what has he done! Canada is your neighbour and friend!
"When prices go up, they never come back down. Remember trump and the wealthy do not feel the pain from lack of products and higher prices, we do"
Trump playing Russian Roulette with the American Economy at the peoples expense! 
Trump lied? Who would have thought
Each 1% in increase in inflation adds 8 years to the average age of retirement. Tell your young people with student debt and no housing they will be living with their parents who are also working forever.
But this is what Americans voted for…. Stop complaining!
"Build a big, most beautiful Norhern border wall and make Trump pay for it!!!!!"
"This is a tax on the middle class, and poor in order to pay for more tax cuts for him, and his rich buddies."
A dozen of eggs cost me over $6 today! Typical lies from Trump and typical gullible Americans put him back in the white house!
In words that Trump can understand: “Efff off” Got it? Love from Canada and wishes for many more….
"2024 FENTANYL BUSTS CAN-USA BORDER ""63 LBS"". MEX-USA BORDER BUSTS ""224,846 LBS"". CANADA IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM FOOLS."
Trust a guy who has filed 6 times for bankruptcy  only in the U.S  
Feeling betrayed yet maga? Don't say we didn't try to warn you.
"You silly twits, you made a huge mess. It will not be cleaned up instantly."
"Poor US.middle class people 

Screwed !"
Canada has two settings - 'Sorry' and 'You'll be sorry'.
It's been years and no one has been able to get through trumps thick head that tarrifs hurt American consumers. Such an idiot.
"Canada isn't against Mexico.  I don't even think that that Doug Ford is truly against Mexico, although he's said some disrespectful things about them.  The point that I believe he's trying (badly) to make, is that Canada has been much more than a trading partner and neighbour, so why are we getting the same treatment as Mexico and WORSE treatment than China?"
People who are upset don't understand what he's doing. Bigger picture don't get stuck in the now like the news does. Of course countries will freak out and try to retaliate.  Have to start somewhere
Trumpy you have fucked with the wrong country!
Damn I thought egg prices were going down first day? 
Ahhhhh let him pay for more not us 
AMERICA YOU WERE WARNED OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT TRUMP ! HARD HEAD MAKES FOR A SOFT BEHIND !
The Dictator and Chief.
"I’m American & live in Texas. My advice to Canada, & Mexico, & any other nation who needs to return my country back to the path of sanity. Put the screws to us. Make this lesson painful & memorable. Teach us Americans to live within the rules & be civilized & empathetic to the world’s citizens. This is the only way to save us from ourselves."
I understand Mexico and China. I’m still trying to figure out Canada. Why Canada?
I'm glad I am old and have money......what a horrible world tRump is leading us into.
Which lies CNN this time tells us or the world??
"Tariffs are a Tax, Companies Not Countries Pay The Tariff Tax, That TAX is often passed along to the consumer."
"One thing these pundits don't mention is how this will affect businesses that sell to Canada and Mexico outside of costs.  Despite tariffs being placed on American goods as retaliation, the citizens of Canada and Mexico will now have a very bad taste in their mouth when considering purchasing any American-made goods even if the tariffs are dropped during Trump's presidency."
Higher prices are never temporary
It's alarming how some people do not know ultimately who will pay for the tariffs. Less than a month in office and already making dumb decisions...4 more years of pain.
This golden age doesn’t sound so golden 
"Funny how the guy who's famous for NOT paying people who work for him says the price will be worth it. 
Enjoy higher prices Americans. Remember, you voted for this."
oh well.. the voters wanted this... yet they complained about high prices under Biden... wait until the tariffs kick in.. 
"What happened to Trumpski's genius, fantastic, perfect free trade deal with Canada and Mexico? Anyone?"
"As an Australian, I'm not shocked by Trump's behaviour but by the fact that the US voted for him, so we have decided enough is enough. As of today, we have put our apartment in NYC up for sale, and we are cancelling our trip to the US in October. We feel we can not travel and spend money in a country under Trump. Even here at our local bottle shop, they are saying there has been a backlash on US-owned alcohol companies, and my work friend's husband works at Tesla here and has mentioned they are having lots of cancelled orders. interesting way to make the USA great."
"trump,is tariffying."
So happy!! America finally u are gonna feel your stupid choice by voting for Trump 
Smoke & Mirrors...its not about tarriffs! Its about closing the borders and isolating..he has no Allies!
Trump’s comments further prove how much a moron he is. This pain will not be short term nor bring America to a golden age until he gets his head out his own butt and stop these tariffs!
The emperor isn't wearing any clothing...
Well having kids definitely off the table now 
I hope Canada and Mexico work together. Doug Ford isn't the best speaker so hopefully Mexico doesn't take what he said too personally.
I hope it's everything the Trump supporters hoped it would be 
"Thank you, Mr President. MAGA !!!"
"Trumps downfall, less than 30 days in. 80 yo man with ego."
"I heard China is going to stop making trump merch.
Better hurry up and get your red hats, gold shoes, fancy diapers, cheap guitars, fake rolex, and trumpy bears fast. Buy in bulk to turn massive profit."
"OH NOOOO, not the guacamole.  Oh, the humanity!!"
I've got a feeling Canada wouldn't even have to impose retaliatory tarifs. Lots of Canadians would most likely by them self boycott everything made in USA.  Even some Europeans might do that.
I have run out of words to describe the sorrow I feel for AMERICA —- USA Voters have pressed the Self Destruct Button. 
PLEASE MR.PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU TURN THE POWER OFF TO USA ON FEB.09 2025
"It is not a question of fentanyl or illegals at the northern border. It is not also Canada badly treating the US. It has all to do with Trump’s goal to increase fiscal revenues in order to pay for the income tax break. Trump really thinks he can solve the US deficit by raising tariffs on all nations exporting to the US. If he is right, that would be the miracle the US needs to get out of its huge debt. however, he can push the US and the world into a deep recession and push the US into a fiscal abyss."
MAKING AMERICA POOR AGAIN  !!
"Canada economy 
is TINY
compare to USA."
"Good… I’m enjoying all this!!! You get what you ask for it…
 There is no Rehabilitation for Stupidity"
I ️ Tariffs 🇺🇸
Oh my God! Trump lied!
How will hipsters and yoga people survive without avocados??? This is a disaster
"Not short term pain.
Pain for his whole term."
America will reject this madness by Trump .
We are being led by a total fool.
It's the Trump tax!
Is Trump gambling with americans life?
MEXICO PESO FELL MORE THAN 2% TO 21.15 AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. MAGA!
"Canada is our next door neighbor and best friend:  Politically, economically, and militarily.  The Don has a funny way of treating friends.  I would not enjoy being in his family.  Thanks a lot Chump."
"You don't have to be an economic guru to figure out that tariffs doesn't solve anything. And for anyone that claims to bring prices lower, thinking that tariff won't affect inflation, it's not thinking right. I just hope these 4 years go by quick, and some other person becomes president from either party, and undo this mess."
"What, but he said he was gonna bring the prices down???"
"The u.s. ranks 36th in the world in literacy.

54% of adults have a literacy below a 6th-grade level (20% are below 5th-grade level)."
"As far as the drug situation,  if people in the United States who would quit using drugs, there would not be a problem."
FDT
Someone once stood on a podium and yelled 'you knew I was a snake and you let me in'.
CNN you need an economics class.
Heard china just withdrew 700 billion in US trade. Yikes.
Trump Tax.
Where was this guy during the rise of inflation?
"Disgusting, absolutely disgusting. We really need to get our shit together, same goes for main stream media. Stop normalizing all of this!"
"In case nobody has not figured it out for themselves, America is now installing a new regime.
It is not democratic.
I would give it a specific and accurate name but, YouTube would delete my comment.
This is the world we live in.
If you do not understand what I'm speaking of, I'll leave you with a quick phrase.
El Duce.
Do your own homework"
The Salt Must Flow Liberal Tears 
"Are eggs a lower price yet? They came down on day 1, correct?"
"Canada's President won't get a hold of Trump, he's on the golf course, and doesn't know how to use a cell phone."
got news for everyone tariffs  are not going to raise prices prices are already through the roof
"Een US handelsoorlog dus.., nou dat zal vooral de US raken dan.."
"You have lost Canadian oil and energy forever. These tariffs have guaranteed the construction of Canadian pipelines to get oil to every other market besides America. I believe this is the end of the alliance between America and Canada. I don’t believe Canada will ever side with America again, you have lost your number one ally on earth."
He Lost his Mind¥
"Even though America collects taxes from the people, I still love America."
25% on oil and energy see how America likes it
"On Fox Business, they're gas lighting viewers about tariffs, telling them that tariffs are a great thing that will bring in all kinds of revenue, and cite the roaring (19)20's as an example of high tariffs during economic expansion. Fox Business omitted the Great Depression, which resulted from a decade of protectionism and trade barriers, and gas lighted their viewers by omitting that tariffs are paid by Importers and consumers - not the foreign exporter."
Musk is trumps brain worm
"Well if Trump managed his Atlantic casinos into bankruptcy,  what should we expect from  him managing the U.S. economy?"
The bottom line is we have five percent of the worlds population and we use twenty percent of the worlds resources. At the same time we have enough food for a country twice our size and more than enough oil within our borders.the worst that could happen is we start producing everything in the United States.If prices go up for a while everyone will be working .
"and so will U.S. companies and workers.  It takes about 10 minutes to find out that if you exclude the oil that U.S. oil companies take south to refine into something useable, the U.S. has a trade surplus in goods and services with Canada.  Do you have any idea how pissed we are up here?  Our government doesn't need to put tariffs on U.S. products to get Canadian consumers to put goods exported from the U.S. last in our purchase decisions."
One thing I have noticed about Americans is that we love liars lol...Who else know the story of Jim Jones?
CNN I realize you are noticing prices now that Trump is in office. But we have gone through this with the last administration. The president you told us that was mentally sharp as a tack . So we will get through this . Maybe you should report on Hakeem Jeffrey being responsible for all the protesting going on today
You were ALL warned.
I’ve seen that headline 1000 times since the inauguration.  Trump is the only one in denial about it.
Nobody believes what you people are saying that's why you're going out of business
"Invitation to become the 51st state of a president who just watched his second largest city burn to the ground, a helicopter and two planes crash the week of his inauguration. No thanks.🇨🇦"
TRUMPFLATION IS HERE LMAO
Look at the big picture. His plan seems the most logical for the future of the US. We can’t possibly continue as we have been.
"I miss over-easy eggs, scrambled eggs, poached eggs, hard-boiled eggs, soft-boiled eggs, egg drop soup, egg foo young, egg fried rice, creme brulee…"
"Canada, please allow americans to seek asylum. I fear i will die here"
Now this media is complaining the prices will go up but when gas was 6 dollars per gallon they’re quiet  like 40 dollars more at gas pump
"Dumbest trade law in history by the dumbest president in history 
🇺🇲"
"Canadians see this as being backstabbed by a trusted ally. Canadians are a lot tougher than you think, we can take any hard times."
Trump  Vance  weird. Mad dogs
"Near Montreal, Quebec, Titanium dioxide (TiO2, Anatase & Rutile forms of the substance) is refined. Anatase is used for pharma (all white 'Aspirin/Tylenol/Advil' type tableting, or pills!), personal care products (i.e., 'Coppertone' sunscreens) while rutile is used for coating agents (i.e., paints you may buy at Home Depot or be used for Hwys., Streets, etc.). The prices for products containing just these 2 fine chemicals just increased...way to go MAGA, real smart!  Take it from me, in the early 1990s, the company I worked for in NJ audited that manufacturing facility!"
"Trump is playing with the tariff war card, and everyone loses even the people who voted for him?!"
"How about we start making things again in America ??? Oh wait, what would the Liberals complain about then ????"
I guess we'll soon find out if it's true that Canadians can live off maple syrup alone
It will NOT impact the rich and privileged.  No pain for the rich only gain.
The peso and the CAD have plummeted but sure.
"Trump, kept his promise to USA about tariffs!!! UNREAL!!!"
"In this world there are MANY enemies of the American Republic both within and without, domestic and foreign. The Canadian people at large however, are NOT among them. Indeed, Americans have no single greater ally on God's green Earth, than they do in Canadians. The truly alarming part to me as a Canadian with deep American family and roots, is not merely the out-of-thin-air tariff and its questionable justifications; it's the widespread aggression and even anger that many Americans now seem to have in support of it. I agree with most of what President Trump has done so far in his short second term...but on this issue, I honestly believe we are watching the formation of a cult of personality that should give any clear, logical, rational thinker a reason to pause."
"Told ya so
$2600?
You're going to pay that for a mid ranged new cell phone lol"
"Bank of America, US Bank Canada and Citibank are in Canada. And most banks allow US bank accounts. More lies"
People were warned but didn't listen.......Have fun with your higher prices people.........
US will only have to bear this for a short period of time after that Canada have to face the reality. The US will need time to adjust their energy needs then relying on canada won't b necessary
Gas prices sure did go down. Couldn't believe how cheap it was to fill up my little 10 gal tank. Several dollars cheaper. Terrif away Mr President.
"On January 20, $1 USD was worth $1.42 CAD. Now it is worth $1.48 CAD. What will it be in another week? A month? Canada is going to bow down so quick, none of this fearmongering is going to matter."
"What’s new America? Once a lying sac, always a lying sac…….buckle up"
When is CNN going out of business
Stop parroting the felon's false arguments.
In all probability Trump will not impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada this Monday. It will be another USAID episode.
Well people wouldn't understand until the very day they got to pay $15 for a pack of eggs that would be the very day they would say what have I done to deserve this
Most of us already knew this.. it was MAG/ who can’t quite grasp the concept
I am not buying anything I  want but only need. I dont have a tax problem.

"“As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.” H.L. Mencken"
Remember most of these issues where supposed to be fixed on day one or before? Looks like that was a lie.
"Doug Ford is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, speaking as a Canadian"
Short term pain really that’s not what he ran on.
Isn’t there a process to enable the Trump tariffs to work in effect? Doesn’t the Senate need to discuss about it before tariffs kick off?
Is this surprising? Your average american doesn't even understand what a tariff is.
This is insane. What's the point of this?
We will find other countries for our oil wood keep our water and hydro
"Jeez. If i were a trumpy advisor i could end this. 
All i need to say is that inflation is killing fast food chains. It’s no longer viable and nobody going to them. If cost becomes higher then McDonalds and kfc will disappear. 
Trumpy “Noooooo!!!!”

Note: I’m not even kidding about the fast food chains. A large number of them will close this year and we will have thousands of unemployed."
""" Short term pain.""Yes only a decade or two."

Sacrifices Must Be Made.  This is an old WWI era German slogan that was commemorated on a postage stamp honoring early aviators.   The aviator depicted was killed in an attempted flight in a home-built airframe that collapsed almost immediately after leaping from a mountain ledge.
Increase tariff to minimum 50% to all countries. 
He wasn’t throwing Mexico under the bus. We stand with them. He just referring to the outright difference in illegal people and drugs/guns coming in from those two countries. We have almost 0 to do with that.
Duh! Wake up!! Start pushing back and never stop pushing back!!!
"As a Canadian, I need to say I have always considered Americans as great people and our friends. I still feel that way. However, we cant sit idly by while the current president tries to destroy our economy. I dont suppose Americans really have a way to know what is taking place right now north of the border at the ground level. Everywhere I go here in our city, all I hear from people is - what can I replace in my purchases both long and short term with some product other than American. Literally dozens of people we know, have cancelled their travel plans in the USA. We have taken 14 assorted cruises in the Caribbean and USA. Every one of them had stops in or originated in the USA. That is over, we will now travel in Europe or the far east. This really has Canadians upset and mobilizing to avoid spending money as much as they can in USA. Personally, I feel Florida, Mr Trumps home state will be one of the hardest hit areas over this - not only from Canadians, but from Mexico and other countries who holiday there as well. Sorry Americans, I wish it didnt have to be this way but we cant just sit and take it. And if we do act in the proper responsible way, seeking out suppliers from other countries - and actively, for the first time in decades, seeking markets in other countries than US, what Americans may give up in a trade war in the way of our resource rich raw materials, and in markets for their goods, once we find alternatives, you will likely lose forever."
"The same people who are saying we shouldn't put tariffs on corporations outside of the USA because it's inflationary are always calling for higher corporate taxes inside of the USA. If tariffs are passed on to consumers then what makes them think corporate taxes aren't also be passed on to consumers? The fact is, corporations don't have unlimited pricing power and they DO have to absorb a large amount of the cost. Why else would importers be trying to stockpile ahead of tariffs? To save money for the consumer? I don't think so. And why would a country protest those tariffs they could simply pass all of the cost to American consumers? Low tariffs on overseas corporations and high taxes on USA corporations is an America Last policy and Trump is taking action to reverse that."
"For years Canada was like the safe and friendly uncle who came to your house every second weekend in the summer and ate all the BBQ and Drank all the beer and then someone came to his senses and realized all that Uncle did for 20 years is bring his charm and smile and nothing else 

Trump just had a talk with that grifter Uncle"
"And the American people deserve every bit of this. The American people either voted for Trump, or awful Kamala Harris, or didn’t bother at all.

The real truth is that the American people themselves are awful and broken."
This is great coming from people who want higher wages but won’t buy American products because they’re too expensive.
Starting a trade war against Canada in hopes of making them into a State is stupid.  Really stupid.
This is what rural America wanted
Impeach Trumpee as he is old.and last term so he doesn't care
"As Prime Minister Trudeau has said, both Canadians and Americans will suffer. It was so unnecessary."
This whole saga between Canada and the USA is super entertaining to watch. 
"Canada, Mexico, and China should form trade agreements."
"Poor Americans, they have no idea what they have voted for..."
Raise them further. Americans will pay even more? How does that make sense!!?
A 10% tariff would have brought money into government coffers without causing much inflation or provoking retaliation.  Excessive.
Saying US consumers will pay price for tariffs and in the meantime imposing tariffs on US is just disingenuous. What Canada is doing shows tariffs hurt consumers in other countries more than one's own.
"Why are American commentators so ignorant and stupid when it comes to tariffs & basic economics?  Trump tariffs WILL increase inflation. Increase food costs. Increase gas & energy costs. increase the costs for cars and farming machinery! Increase the costs for phones, TV’s, computers, white goods, pharmaceutical goods, etc etc. This is what 77 million MAGA Republican Cult supporters voted for! Trump voters want this!!!"
After the last administration kept prices so cheap? How could they? Shame on them.
"Secure your border, no more tariff.  The US can live without Canadian products."
"This will resurface continually until Canada learns to diversify trade with other countries. US constantly threatening tariffs is becoming tiresome, and I for one will avoid American products where obviously possible."
"CNN, you've never seen before such a great american president as Mr Trump!!! right???"
Short time pains for how long ? How many countries?
"There will be inflation, but he will “blame Canada”."
"You can't even become a propper banana republic
if bananas become too expensive"
"The U.S. market is too valuable for trade disruptions to matter long-term. If one supplier exits, another quickly steps in. Tariffs are leverage, not a crisis—America adapts, and partners are always ready to replace those who retaliate."
A drop in the price of energy will counteract this by 10 times
"Canada offer him building a joint nationalized ""Great Trump Pipeline"" for inceased mutually profitable and stable oil.  He would go for it."
"100% the tariffs will cause long term pain for Americans. Plus, non tariff actions will seriously amplify the pain.  Canadians are now aggressively not buying American products. Canada will create new companies to replace. Canada will start selling all of its natural resources elsewhere, starving the US of needed oil, gas, metals, potash, lumbar, and a lot more."
"The rich stock holders could see to it that there greed is bot necessary at this juncture an instead of being blind to what is happening with the own pride. They would want to keep the prices down and pay employees more for the minimum wage workers and this would show unity and a form to the other countries, but do what to think about it first.  I know that some people will lie to your face with a smile and say how much they care for you and this country but in fact they do lie. One way to see who is on the side of the USA is to watch and see."
He never mentioned tariffs on Canada and Mexico until after the election. It was not a campaign promise.
"Stop asking Democrats to ""do better"" where ARE YOU CHICKEN REPUBLICANS!!!"
We dont buy things that are too expensive....try that to avoid the pain.
“Could mean” …. It WILL MEAN higher prices for Americans and not short term …
"Just to be clear, Doug Ford the Conservative Premier of Ontario, and Danielle Smith, the Conservative Premier of Alberta are throwing Mexico under the bus, NOT our Federal Government. Canada has a trade agreement with Mexico and the United States which Trump helped negotiate. Canadians honour their commitments, unlike the U.S. president."
Your right it only takes 16 days to conquer inflation. You are correct in the world of rhetoric you live in!
People worried about tariffs raising prices don't think that raising taxes on companies raise prices
Are there people in the U.S. who still believe that tariffs are paid by the exporting country when they are paid by the U.S. importer and thus the American consumer?
excellent analysis Mr Brownstein ! I agree in particular with your observation regarding Mr Ford throwing Mexico under the bus .This is a mistake. We should be united against Trump’s aggression.
"25% tariffs!  In a week, will Canadian malls stock enough inventories to sell to the USA shoppers? With loonies down below 69 cents to $1 USD, the same items in Canadian malls are so so so much CHEAPER to the USA households !"
"He said that economic pain will be worth it. Yes, because he won't experience it; it will be experienced by us, the general population."
My dad worked for 20 years underground as a safety engineer in the mine that has 85% of the world's nickel in Sudbury Ontario. His mine alone provided 40% of all the nickel used in the entire Allied war effort for world war 2. I live near a farm in British Columbia that produces 90% of the world's blueberries. Good luck with your morning smoothies ladies.
"When will the country have a real project in education, health, transportation and support for farmers? So GM doesn't sell cars every week the workers get scared again!!  Calm down get retired"
Maybe the US shouldn't be creating a demand for those drugs ... no?
At least we’ll pay higher prices for a reason.
"Canadians will not come back… you’ve highlighted the fact we need to buy from Canadian companies.  We send you oil, lumber and minerals.  This will damage our relationship for a long time."
"It's easy for the Rich to tell the Poor to ""bear the pain for a little while"" because they will never feel the pain. Even a 25% increase in prices would not make them feel the pain. 
""a little while"" -  may also mean   ""years""."
America's about to party like it's 1929
"What don't people understand about trickle down economics.  The object is to concentrate the nation's wealth into the economic elite.  That is the dear leader s economic policy.  In addition to shifting the tax burden, the next steps will be to shut down programs that benefit the middle class like social security, Medicare, education funding,  agriculture subsidies, etc."
I'm so glad I started watching CNN. I now know the real truth and how inept Trump is. Thank you for opening up my eyes. Said NO ONE.
"When there's such a high demand for drugs in America how can you stop the flow of drugs. Oh yeah, just say no."
Canada and Mexico should make a free  trade deal. Press pause with the USA
"I understand that Doug Ford didn't communicate his point directly, but I think when sayings don't lump us in with Mexico and China, he's referring to the erroneous premise that Trump has used for Fentanyl crossing the border. The estimate is that less than 1% crosses the Canadian border."
Bring prices down on day one. CHECK. DONE. End the war in Ukraine on day one CHECK. DONE. It's just a big love fest over in Ukraine. Looks like Donald Trumps presidency is off to a smashing success so far. That man is an absolute genius. Move aside Albert!
I can choose what products I buy. I can't choose to pay the taxes imposed on me to make up for the trade deficits.
"Let's say it's ""totally fine"", as you said. It's not totally fine. You don't treat your closest allies like this. Even the thought of imposing these tariffs is disrespectful and, frankly, insulting."
"Forget about the price of eggs. Don't forget about them student loans that are coming out of forbearance from block and pause by the courts on top of the exponential amount of increase in food and groceries and gas and oil changes, car parts, or a gallon of milk to be put on blast by local media. The short term memory is astounding!"
"Yes, tariffs will raise prices. That's kind of the point. The goal is to raise prices to a point where it costs less to manufacture in the US than overseas. This will bring manufacturing back to the US and raise the median household income because manufacturing jobs pay better than the ""service industry"" jobs people are currently doing. The reason why we're targeting Canada and Mexico is to specifically bring automobile manufacturing jobs back to the US. These jobs left the US when NAFTA became law. The goal is to repair the damage done by NAFTA."
Canada should’ve just put 100% tariffs on all American goods. They can always substitute it from the ROW with immediate effect!
The chickens are charging too much for their eggs. They need to start laying eggs at a cheaper price.Hehe
"agree - Canada, Mexico and China need to be united on this tariff issue otherwise, they will lose on their own."
it's not temporary.  it will last as long as the tarrifs.
No intelligent or patriot person  would ever harm it's own nation on purpose.
Selling the snake oil again.
Going to be interesting to watch the stock market on Monday.
Why would anybody believe a convicted felon
"""Just I promised I will being prices down on day 1..""
And every economist thrughout the country spit up their coffee and laughed for several minutes..."
Canada should target Tesla products with 100% tariffs.
"In the words of the great comedian Brandon Shoob, ""Water we dune hair, B?"""
Why Canada is putting tariffs back to punish own citizens
President Trump is a brilliant leader and business man. How lucky America is to have such a wise president.
It’s a violation of the free trade agreement.
"Trump believes “Why pay more elsewhere when you can pay more , for American made products..
…
Got no money? Buy elsewhere.."
CNN the gaslighting Network 
"""NO QUESTION""  Americans have the choice to buy what they want.  If Tariffs make prices go up I won't be buying more expensive items and will choose American goods over foreign."
#1 issue is inflation which was caused by Trump not handling  COVID correctly..
There is no such thing as short term when it comes to money.  Financial pain today affects a family's  assets forever going forward.  Get it?
"Cant believe there are so many guillible americans, once bitten twice shy and they still voted for trump"
"The easy way to understand tariffs is that they are essentially sales taxes on everything that is tariffed. Generally, the consumer will pay the tariff, or in some cases more, as if it is a raw material it will cost more as an input and profit margin will apply.
Also, generally, domestic suppliers raise their prices to match those of the tariff-added import. 
Finally, tariffs have a bigger impact on poor and middle-class people than the wealthy."
Tariffs are not inflationary. They will raise prices once but not month after month. Also the products that Canada and Mexico place retaliatory tariffs on will flood in the domestic market lowering prices for us here at home.
"This isn't only about economy. Actually, its much much more."
Why do these simple ideas need to be explained now? Months after the election. Are Americans too busy watching professional wrestling to think about these things?
"This didn’t age well, Obviously this guy knows nothing because Mexico and Canada folded."
"President Trump said, ""We will feel a little pain."" He won't, but most Americans will! "
God bless America 🇺🇸 and God bless President Donald Trump
"If the Republicans were read a little bit more about Trump, none of this would’ve happened thanks a lot Republicans"
Lmao wait Canada trying to use we both white line that was disgusting 
"Trump just doesn’t like 
Justin Trudeau."
"Don't worry, there will be a seller out there willing to offer competitive pricing to beat other sellers which will force other sellers to follow suit. Consumers dictate the price."
US imports more than it exports. Because of these tariffs there will be a huge gap in the supply and demand if the Americans going to rely on Americans products. Eventually Americans will have to pay the extra 25% to make their businesses running.
I guess U.S and Canada are no longer friends within 4 or 8 yrs..right?
Idk what you guys hear. Ive heard from Canadians that not to listen to Trudeau. That they hate him and Canada people want to agree to it.
We don’t we just put a billion in gold bars on Dump’s head?
Americans need to strongly oppose these tariffs to get Trump to revert this dumb decision.
Time for Canada to step up and develop their own quality brands and stop relying on the US.
Golden age of America? pstttt..... hahahhahaa.  The Golden Age was in the 50s to 70s.  Those days are long gone.  America is on the decline.  How many average American can afford a house these days?
The true reason is our debt.   He is making Americans finally to start paying our national debt.
“American people expect ‘some’ pain.” -Trump
"Tariffs are a tax on foreign companies…yeah, sure they are."
"There is no ""problem"" with the northern border.  His goal is to annex Canada.  This is the equivalent of a non-military (for now) move out of the Putin playbook."
Canada's economy is as bright as CNN's ratings.
This will be used as an excuse to raise the debt limit for tax cuts!
He's not FDR
Jim Acosta should’ve never left the weekend show. Look at him now.
"There is 90% trade imbalance already between canada, China Mexico and US. we import everything. Maybe some pain but those other countries will suffer much more. I’m willing to pay more for Canadian bacon and maple syrup."
In support of canada i wont be buying any american products
"The fentanyl raw materials from China are sold to Canada and Mexico pharmaceuticals  . So if there were any problems, US should blame Canada and Mexico and herself. How Canada distribute or made this raw material is up to them, so how can China interfere ? Even so, how come US doesn’t have any security check or custom check to make sure those finished products will not  fall into the wrong hands. They are slackened or incompetent but then to blame others for the drug problem."
MEXICO PESO FELL MORE THAN 2% TO 21.15 AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. MAGA!

"Hahahah, now his promises are gone "
"AAA average gas prices have been dropping for a week, which makes no sense vs, the 25% Trump Tariff on Canada. I am wondering if there might be data manipulation?!"
SOMEONE NEED TO STOP THIS BULLY SERIOUSLY JUST CRAZY
I think Canadian consumer also have to pay higher prices 
Thanks a lot Trump 
"Such a stupid thing for Doug Ford to keep on going with the same antimexican speech and disgracing himself by begging Donald Trump to ""Please please I don't want to be compared with Mexico, we are different"". We stand a better chance in the negotiating table if we stand together as a common front... I just don't understand the logic"
Those Mexican agricultural imports will hit hard. Just in time for superbowl.
Yep Canadians will just stop going on vacation to USA. Europeans will side with Canada as well.
Promise you will lower the prices. He just wants to make himself rich by raising the prices and getting the tax.
"Such ignorant people, MAGA folks."
Facing a bully some Canadian politicians tried to throw Mexico under the bus to appease Trump.  That reflects the attitude and character and make Trump want to bully Canada more. LOL
It’s not a tariff it’s a special Trump tax hissy fit…..I say we put 75 percent tariffs on energy ….love Canada 🇨🇦
"Price hikes will be ok for the rich , but what about the rest of us? Tax time is coming, can we not pay federal taxes? Trump doesn’t so why should we?"
"The US consumers may have to pay higher prices  but the US citizens are winning. Sometimes there is a price to be paid for being victory.
The US has to show the world that the United States is the land of justice and fairness. 
What did JFK say ? Ask not what the country can do you for you. Ask what you can do  for your country."
This Ford dude keeps throwing Mexico under the bus.
A small price to pay. Other effects will balance out any effects from tariffs.
How about having an economist and international lawyer because he is in violation of the trade agreements
"The DNC socialist babblers 
are back on the Internet. "

"Canada and Mexico should pay for what they have done with mr. Musk. Stop fentanyl, say no to drugs!"
"Please, for the love of God watch the movie made about him in the 90s, ""Small Potatoes, Who Killed The USFL."" He owned the NJ Generals, and had Hershel Walker under contract.

"IGNORE the 
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE 
of Canada and Mexico.  

Awesome neighbors. "
Canadians needs to stop the dairy cartel...and need to allow American banks into Canada before talking about tarrifs
Amazing how cnn watchers are experts on everthing
"Tariffs and immigrant farm worker loss will create massive shortages of food and loss of jobs.  Lost jobs will cause foreclosures  on homes. N The food magnates will jack up the price of everything. We will have inflation and high unemployment, resulting in a recession like none before."
The rich will stay rich and the poor will suffer a lot. Imagine Apple products price will get more expensive.
He's an habitual liar you cant believe a word he says surely you have learned that.
"That's ok i can live without Ford, BMW and Tequila"
"Biden economic cost me 4,600 dollars a year ... Trumps tariffs are going to  cost me 2,600 . The math is working ."
This pain could be terminal for many Americans all for what
"he's bluffing, already he's giving mexico a month extension."
I'm quite sure that President Trump have got the best economists and advisors around him to do what he is doing about all the tariffs and I hope and prayer that the citizens must have faith in their president and not to allow the media and all those socalled experts influence their beliefs in what their president is trying to achieve in the interest of the american society and possibly the rest of the world.
Don't see how this will change a thing. Bidenomics the last four years have taught me how to live without alot of things.
Ford has plants near Buffalo and upstate NY that have parts for high end trucks that come from both countries and the 24% tariffs will ironically cause trucks from other foreign countries to sell in bigger numbers.
Us consumers already pay higher prices during biden last year. You ID didn't know that
"No, dummies, consumers will be just fine. Probably will consume little less and demand higher quality for a change "
"i would recomend us citizens to stay out of europe, for the next 4 years, because people are angry. so enter at your own risk. we stand with canada and mexico."
If people I the U.S. stopped using drugs….
My question is how much will Trump and his billionaire buddies make from this BS.
"These reporters are the worst,  where is the same outrage about high price of the last administration."
"Answer this question,maggaz, to confirm my fears..If you add cost to a thing, does that thing now cost more??
.... Take yer time, don't rush it ."
Well not really! Short term sure but long term we can find new trade partners with more favorable trade deals.
Are you not entertained!
"How surprising. Price of eggs are up, inflation is up, stock market is tanking and we’ve pissed off the rest of the world. All in less than a month. Regular Americans getting screwed while billionaires make out.  "
Canada and Mexico shall double the retaliation by imposing 50% tariff on US goods.
Yes!!! I've been pushing calling it the Trump Tax everywhere! Name and shame and maybe it'll get through to his followers! Everyone should take this up!
"Is implementing tariffs harder than lowering prices, or easier?"
Donald Duck is not going to lead to a global economic disaster...
"Trump don’t eat fruit and avocado, he doesn’t drink alcohol. He only eat McDonald’s and Diet Coke."
"I think a lot of Canadians are waking up to the intensity of American hatered of Canada. Wow, and here we were all these years thinking that we are friends. This is really amazing. If Americans hate Canda this much, who do they like? Anyone?"
"I love Canada but from my perspective Tariffs were necessary to wake us up and for our greater good (many will disagree but we all can have a difference of opinion!). Unfortunately misplaced patriotism is being whipped up because no one cares for Common Canadians. Where were these politicians for last 2 years when grocery chains, banks, auto makers etc were price gouging us and increasing their profits? They raised the bogey of supply chain issues, never allowed outside chains to come in and held us ordinary Canadians hostage. Inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. Where did excess money come from? Only immigration? Grocery chains and alcohol producers made big profits without allowing inter provincial movement of goods, while we struggled with taxes, food and rent, so really who cares about  tariffs? Trump will force us to allow foreign companies to come here, excess internal supply will be diverted to us, hence less money will chase more goods, hopefully driving down prices.  The main downside is loss of jobs but companies were anyways silently laying off people last year under the radar so that will continue. I think we need something like this to wake up our politicians, who are hand in glove with corporate Oligarchy. No offence to anyone!"
We’ve been paying for the last 4 years
"Some pain for the poor, may be not for the rich."
yep being the president i just forgot to tell you prices will go up and we will cut the budget so dont count on us for any relief just feel the pain and enjoy my presidency
"Trump will lower income tax but would want you to pay more, lalala"
"Trump: ""Is my pilot light still lit and I feel this urgency to go poo."""
"What is going to happen is from Canada, the US will stop buying their sour crude reducing overall supply in the system which will increase the price of gas. 
American consumers wont like it, but Canada will really hate losing the 250 billion they usually make off the crude AND paying higher prices at the pump. 

Mexico, remittances will be way down because of deportations, goods wont be sent to the us over the boarder which will result in layoffs. Americans may see an increase in vegetable prices and unavailability of some items to purchase."
RON BROWNSTEIN WILL BE THE FIRST!! 
It won't be so short term. You've lost the trust of your closest ally. We're looking elsewhere now to source and sell our goods.
That guy say guacamole instead of wack. This hommie can come to the carne asada
What’s new. We been paying the price the last 4 years because of demoncrats.
i'm sure Americans are good with facing pain to keep drugs and criminals out of our country is this gal even an American citizen reporting this shit?
"Every year in the USA around 100.000 people die of drug addiction (and related health problems). Very, very sad situation !  My sincere  condolences to the families involved!

... BUT:

- If it weren't fentanyl it would be some other drugs (heroin; other synthetic drugs, etc. ), at least partly.

- To think Trump gives a damn about 100.000+ us drug addicted is laughable.

- To think that tariffs (especially toward Canada and Europe where fentanyl is almost unknown) would solve the problem of us citizens with drug addiction is laughable.

The tariffs implemented by THE FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION  TO BRING  BACK TO THE USA JOBS (LESS THAN 3000 IN TOTAL & MOSTLY LOW LEVEL FACTORY JOBS), COSTED TO THE US AMERICAN TAX PAYER A SUM IN EXCESS OF:  ""800.000 US DOLLARS EACH"" (PAYED IN TARIFFS). THE US FARMERS EXPOSED TO COUNTER-TARIFFS (SOYBEAN PRODUCERS) HAD TO BE SUPPORTED (AND STILL ARE TO THIS DAY)  WITH 100+ millions US DOLLARS PAYED WITH INCOME TAXES (...ON YOUR INCOME FOR EXAMPLE) . MEANWHILE, CHINA MADE LONG TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH BRAZILIAN FARMS.

- 2024 IS THE 100 YEARS ANNIVERSARY OF THE REMOVAL OF THE ""PITTSBURGH PLUS"" TARIFF GUESS BY WHO? - THE GOP .

- THIS ATTITUDE  WILL SPUR THE DECISION OF BRICS COUNTRIES TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT CURRENCY, IN SUBSTITUTION OF THE US DOLLAR,  AS AN UNDERLYING CURRENCY FOR MOST RAW MATERIALS CONTRACTS (OIL; IRON ORE; COPPER; GOLD ; SILVER; ETC ETC. ). THUS COMPROMISING US AND WESTERN DEMOCRACIES SUPPLY CHAINS CONTROL.

THIS USELESS, COMPLETELY USELESS, TRADE WAR WILL AFFLICT  THE AVERAGE CITIZENS AND DAMAGE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WESTERN DEMOCRACIES FOR YEARS TO COME.

And now, if the U.S. military wants to stay in Korea, they will have to pay monthly rent!

- Korean people -"
Did prices go up yet?
Did anyone pay the price while Biden didn’t end one original Trump tariff during his administration?
Canada should stop sending illegal immigrants. Canada is doing. US stop raising the tariff .
But you don’t givafcc about the hundreds of billions in trade deficits as buy from them but they won’t even allow us to bank in canada
"Lol, those who voted him in believed him too,  crazy."
Everyone knows Tariffs won’t solve our drug problem. Only education starting in kindergarten will end this continual epidemic.  We have to  stop Americas cravings for these drugs.
I wonder what percentage of Trump voters are in agrement with his actions?
If you buy U.S products no difference.
"All Canada needs to do is start normalizing relationships with China. Then watch Trump run barefoot, begging Canadians to return to the original trade agreement. Canadians have options; Americans don’t, because all they want is dominance. But Trump’s stupidity doesn’t stop there. If he wants to keep the U.S. a superpower, he needs allies—not trade wars with its closest friends (who aren’t so close anymore)."
"Trump has underestimated the poverty in America. Most of us won't be paying more for things, we'll just be going without. We just won't be able to buy what we need. Not like we're able to afford much now anyways."
"Hey CNN, why are you not talking about the treasury?"
Those who voted for this   thanks
 GOT IT 
Him just want to put the tariffs so he will tell his supporters he did what he promised you guys .
"CNN better support Mr trump,,,USA is Rising!!!"
"Sure, but we'll also reap the benefits of them after they do their job. Don't be a simpleton, we see the bigger picture here.

The trade deficits devalue the American worker and drive up inflation as well as the national debt. We need few things from other countries. Certainly not lopsided trade deals.

We're the greatest country on earth. We have reasonable expectations of those we do business with. Our economy will remain strong and theirs will collapse under the pressure of their Hubris."
"America is an import nation. Unbalanced trade balances with other countries are not a bug, they are a feature"
I dont think that donald understand what tariffs actually mean to Americans...and I mean besides putting the rest of the worlds discussed towards your country.  Nice try trying to blame a drug problem
He’s just picking fights because it keeps him in the spotlight. Also makes it able to portray friends as enemies… which makes it easier to walk away from them…
With friends like that who needs enemies
"Canada and Mexico were asked to solidify their border. They didn't. Canada was asked to spend more that 1% of their GDP on their military. They responded ""Why? the US will protect us."" Wrong answer."
"For all of those arguing with the tariffs. 

Yes both country citizens will hurt in the short term but imo will be better for long term. For Americans, go to the government census website on trade between US and these countries. We import BILLIONs more than they import from the US and have for years. We are supporting their economy significantly more than they are helping ours. Evening out the balance sheet has to be done at some point. 

You can’t argue with the discrepancy although I do wish he didn’t take such a harsh action."
US and Canada can keep tariff and give tax relief
It will be long term pain unless Trump comes to his senses
Trickle up pain won't reach the White House and its billionaires.
"I remember Trump when he was just a flamboyant braggart. Now he's flat out malicious. Maybe he figures that he's going to die soon, and wants to take the world with him. I would not rule this out! He's getting crazier every day."
"It won’t last very long, they made their bed now they can sleep in it"
"DT, here to take your money and freedom."
u think this but we dont relie on trade as much as uthink we can and have relied soley on our own resorces tho greenland rareearth metals is the only thing but that will be taking care of soon!
"cut off electricity to the US East coast, cut off oil to the Midwest, cut off natural gas, cut off potash, and we can keep going Trump. From the USA to the new USSR ️🇨🇦"
I think it's more to this tariff plan....Long Term it's gonna work
Even the staunchest trump fan with the barest knowledge of history & economics knows this isnt going to end well.  Just riding the wave.
Canada should join BRICS.
"Great move making sure the gap between the have and have not

"It Won’t hurt the billionaire class…what a hero….promised cheap groceries bla bla. It will take years for this to maybe have more production in the US, there is no infrastructure or supply chains etc etc. =higher prices for years…"
Trump promised tariffs (higher prices) in his campaign. He kept his promise.
Tariffs go to the Government .

"the only way to make inflation go down is back to basic, supply and demand. make more supply, increase production, increase efficiency and more.
that way the price will come down, nice and smooth

"If anyone is curious, you may be saying “why is he doing this? And why now!?”….(at a time when Americans are already struggling..) The answers are simple to me. It’s because he HAS to fix inflation for one, and two he’s determined to place tariffs. Unfortunately the two don’t mix…Not to mention….he will want to get elected for a third term. So, he has to do the tariffs now so that it he has time rebound and to try fixing inflation before “re-election”. This way he still gets all 3. He gets his tariffs, he gets his “I fixed it moment, and then his cult re-elects him a third term…

The other possible plan b is, that he keeps doing these new laws and making changes until the left breaks out in violence. He then declares marshal law, squashes the rebellion/violence and then he suspends constitution. Boom, he’s a full blown dictator. 

These are my worst case scenarios essentially."

"It's wild to me that CNN doesn’t understand the laws of economics. Supply and demand. Removing people from this country decreases the supply and the demand, but decreases the demand far more than it decreases the supply. Removing federal workers and benefits from those on welfare, but are perfectly capable of working reduces our liabilities and increases the labor pool. The majority of these newly unemployed laborers will take jobs that create new supply. Tarrifs contribute to this new supply and job pool by forcing companies to make their product in America. It's already working with Canadian companies."
Suddenly Republicans are ok with a price hike! what a joke they are

Wait I thought trump promised to lower pricesnot raise them
Remember everyone forecasting economic apocalypse first time he got elected?
Canada cant do much to the usa neither can mexico
Canada also tariff America does that mean it will not cost inflation in Canada or is it only in America because is trump
That's what they voted for. This Really is a good movie p2
Seems to be that things have changed over the past 24 hours huh
"This is ultimately NOT true, but it depends on how things turn out.
    These tariffs could majorly shify how and what products are sold here in America.
    The only way it could be bad is if people keep buying products and using services that could very well be made and used here inside the U.S. from other countries.
   If executed correctly, thes tariffs could force a HUGE bloom of jobs in the U.S. Allow buisness inside the country to flourish and bring back real value back to the American dollar. 🇺🇸"
Omg.  We need manufacturing back.  1st step.
"Trump......How can I give tax breaks to my rich friends......I know I'll put a tax on everything all Americans buy and they will pay more for everything and we'll take that money to fund the tax breaks for the rich...... brilliant!!, All I need to do is find a few rubes to believe that I'm helping them."
It's  called 'trump tax'.
"I'm % in favor of Tariffs for Canada & Mexico, if they retaliate then raise Tariffs even more, I support President Trump making US 🇺🇸 Great Again through Tariffs"

The key is the yearly interest payments, which the U.S. Treasury Department's October report estimated will hit a record $1.2 trillion for fiscal year 2025, which ends next Sept. 30. The Federal Reserve Board's Nov. 7 interest-rate cut by one-quarter percentage point could reduce that somewhat."""

"Canada should respond by introducing a 125% export tariff on energy and other critical exports to the US. 
Recognising Trump's professed love for tariffs, Canada shouldn't let the hard work of raising tariffs fall solely on Trump & Co. Instead, in the spirit of friendship and cooperation, and as a sign that Canada wishes to share the administrative burden of tariffs, it should have an equivalent export tariff for anything that Trump is introducing tariffs on.

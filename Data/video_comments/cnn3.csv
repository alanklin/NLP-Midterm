What part of his companies declaring bankruptcy 6 times did people not understand?

What part of his own leadership to not work with Democrats for a better immigration policy do people not understand?

What part of the fact that he is a known narcissist do people not understand?
Those traits are as follows...

Symptoms include an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others' feelings, an inability to handle any criticism, and a sense of entitlement.grandiosity, callous and unemotional traits, disregard for others' feelings, excessive need for admiration, or social isolation...

What part of those symptoms do not fit tRUMP?

Talked to a Trump supporter the other day, he was ecstatic when Trump won back in November and then now, he doesn't feel so good because he is actually a Canadian and still have family back in Canada

He simply said ""I wanted trump when we don't know what he would do, and believing that he wouldn't actually put tariff on""

That's the issue, many people supported trump because they think he wouldn't do anything. But well, I guess you get who you voted for......

Trump mentioned that there would be some ""pain"" after he imposes tariffs. If you are a Trump supporter, clearly you are comfortable with this right now. But for how long? How much pain are you willing to endure? How much are you willing to watch others endure? And for how many months? Or years? How long do you realistically expect it to take before Americans can start to see their circumstances improve and to feel the pain subside? Or, could there ever come a point where the pain has become so unbearable, and has lasted for so long, that you would finally dare to stand up and say: ""Enough, Mr. President. Enough. This is not working."" Could there ever come such a point? Or would you just loyally endure the suffering forever, like a beaten dog that would never even conceive to leave its master...

What's even more disappointing is how Trump's rhetoric has really twisted the facts.  The only reason that the US has a trade deficit with Canada is because of the volume of lower cost crude sold from Canada to the US.  If you take that out of the equation, the US is the one with the surplus.  There is no logic to this approach, especially given that Canada is the United State's largest customer.  Despite this episode, we Canadian really do cherish our neighbours to the south, which is partly why this stings so much.

Since Trump took office, there seem to have been more unfavorable results in America. These results include effects on the markets, such as price declines and sharp increases in inflation, as well as bank failures. I wonder if the sudden increase in interest rates will help value investors or if it would be wiser to stay away from the stock and financial markets for the time being.

When he says they owe us a lot of money and I'm sure they're gonna pay, he's mimicking the mob bosses from every 1940's-70's gangster film we ever saw. And I'm sure he's found a way to get them to pay HIM.

It‚Äôs fascinating that the complete narrative isn‚Äôt being shared. Why should we permit other nations to impose steep tariffs on our goods? and not do the same, by raising tariffs , this creates an opportunity for negotiation vs doing nothing and giving all of the countries a free pass.

Why would people think that it's a good thing to increase tariffs and pay more for everything.
Not to mention that higher tariffs will cause manufacturers in the US to shut down.
Then you have the tariffs wars between the US, Canada, Mexico, and China.

I do love how Trudeaus tariffs are targeted at red states
51% ...and that's BEFORE people feel the consequences.
17% of Americans think the tariffs will have a positive effect. 46% believe it will have a negative effect. 37% couldn‚Äôt read the question
"Canada has been a loyal friend, selling you energy and raw materials at discounted prices. And this is the thanks we get."
Americans have no one to blame but themselves.
"Never in the history of the USA has a president done so much, so fast!.................. to alienate his allies."
The fact that even 38% support this should worry everyone...
This is stupid. The average American will get screwed.
"I told you I was a snake.
You knew exactly who I am.
And yet, you took me in anyway
How can you be surprised?"
"As a Canadian, I never saw a gun in my life, never paid for healthcare, and was not broke after finishing my studies. I want to remain in such a country."
Maybe they should have googled it before November
Tariffs = Trump TAX
"The time that Americans should have said ""no, no, no"" was last November.  It's too late for polls now."
"A wise man once said,  You can‚Äôt fix stupid"
When prices go up because of tarrifs they stay up and don't go back down. Congrats red states you voted for this.
I know people (American's) who are going out of their way to buy Canada products and NOT buy America. We are pissed off!!
"Americans are saying no, no, no to tariffs. Just one problem with that. Trump could care less what Americans think. He is now the president and does not need you."
Many have already started boycotting American products due to these tariffs
He said he wanted to make the entire world respect America again. But his own actions are causing disrespect from the world.
As a Canadian I'll never cross border again to shop .   Let see how America will be great again . .. America also need our money Canadians spend so much in Buffalo .
The new American dream is to stop the nightmare
Don't underestimate Canadians. Never mistake politeness with weakness
"As an American, I support the retaliatory tariffs being imposed on Red states."
"Trust is gone. Canada is already seeking other markets, and Canadians are reading labels. Hard thing to walk back. Too bad for decent Americans...where are you?"
"Trump's new cap: ""MAKE AMERICANS POOR AGAIN"""
"As an American citizen I don‚Äôt want to pay for Trump‚Äôs tariff. My salary didn‚Äôt increased by 25% and Elon Musk didn‚Äôt give me over $300M. I want cheap Mexican, Canadian and Chinese goods!"
As a Canadian I can tell you that I've never seen our country so united in our anger and feeling of betrayal by your president and country... it's been decades and decades that üá®üá¶ has supported the üá∫üá≤... I really am sad because I think he's inflicted permanent damage to our relationship... the trust has been broken
Tariffs make the imports more expensive for Americans. Why would anyone want that? Just stupid.
So this tells that 38 percent of Americans have no clue how tariffs work and that our public schools are failing us because it should be 90 percent of Americans should be against tariffs like this!
There are no words to describe how much I despise this president for what he is doing to Canada. I have friends there who are ready to fight to their deaths. Our country elected a monster.
The world would be better off not trading with America for the next four years
This is a tax on Americans people don‚Äôt seem to understand this
"Why is Trump putting a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, but only a 10% tariff on China? Is it because Elon Musk does billions of dollars worth of business with China and Trump doesn't want to disrupt Musk's business interests?"
I hope Americans come together like Canadians and stop this madness. Say no to Trump!
Too bad. That‚Äôs what they voted for. Voting matters. They will soon be in the find out phase. Good luck!
Did he really earn a degree from Wharton??? His obsession with tariffs would say not!!!
"We, the People, are so SCREWED. The economy is going to TANK."
"‚ÄúOh shut up, silly American,‚Äù said DonaId the Reptile with a grin,
‚ÄúYou knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in."""
"Wake up, America ! Lock him up already !!!"
"But American were voting for this guy, so why 51%? Good job American people."
"Canada showed up on 911, we show up when there‚Äôs forest fires in California and we fight alongside you in every world war and every battle, Afghanistan, etc. This is just rude"
THE TRUMP TAX will hurt everyone.
"Even 38% support this, which should be cause for concern..."
I don‚Äôt get it.   That‚Äôs  CNN      Always wrong
Trump needs the tariffs to cover up for the Tax cuts for big corporations and rich people.  by flipping the bill to the regular person
Making America Go Alone
"Canadian here, we feel hurt and betrayed! We will forgive but we will never forget"
Majority of Americans voted for this! This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
He literally ran his campaign on imposing these tariffs! Now they are surprised?!
Some Americans understand this is not going to work out well. Most Canadians do too. This will increase prices for every consumer and hurt business growth and jobs. This is what happens though when you put a moron in a top office.
The stupid part of American voted for this on the onset! All those idiots searching for tariffs on google after electing that criminal is moronic! Just can‚Äôt fix stupidity!
Stand strong Mexico and Canada.
Why give someone so stupid so much power?
Too late America! You voted knowing who this madman was!
‚ÄúDonald Trump was the dumbest goddam student I ever had.‚Äù - Wharton Economics Prof. William T. Kelley
"Amazing video, A friend of mine referred me to a financial adviser sometime ago and we got talking about investment and money. I started investing with $120k and in the first 2 months , my portfolio was  reading $274,800. Crazy right!, I decided to reinvest my profit and gets more interesting. For over a year we have been working together making consistent profit just bought my second home 2 weeks ago and care for my family."
To those of you who didn't learn the first time: You did this!
"What part of his companies declaring bankruptcy 6 times did people not understand?

What part of his own leadership to not work with Democrats for a better immigration policy do people not understand?

What part of the fact that he is a known narcissist do people not understand?
Those traits are as follows...

Symptoms include an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others' feelings, an inability to handle any criticism, and a sense of entitlement.grandiosity, callous and unemotional traits, disregard for others' feelings, excessive need for admiration, or social isolation...

What part of those symptoms do not fit tRUMP?

This is the part I just can't understand.. HE WAS ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES!"
"Trump has been a disaster.  If he does not resign, remove him before he does anymore damage."
What about if every country tell Trump to get their military bases out of their countries?
"They owe us a lot of money... From what? From investing in Treasurys, in which case Canada has $328.7 billion? Make it make sense."
"As someone from outside the US, I will no longer be supporting American companies."
Wait till prices start to rise. His numbers will be in the teens
"Canadian here trust me we will not forgot your digraceful actions, we have already started trade with the eu japan and china took us 2 weeks"
maybe next time americans decide their vote on stuff that matters instead of stupid woke/anti-woke bs topics...fafo indeed
"Talked to a Trump supporter the other day, he was ecstatic when Trump won back in November and then now, he doesn't feel so good because he is actually a Canadian and still have family back in Canada

He simply said ""I wanted trump when we don't know what he would do, and believing that he wouldn't actually put tariff on""

That's the issue, many people supported trump because they think he wouldn't do anything. But well, I guess you get who you voted for......"
"It's going to destroy the hard-working poor, disabled, seniors, poor kids"
Where do CNN get their polling?! I understand why their ratings are in the pits!!!!

"Tariffs will become even less popular as they affect people's bottom-line.

The longer they are in place the worse they are."
As an American I‚Äôm saying trump is doing the wrong thing
If a president make his people pay more for a living that's very clever.
"Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have said yes, yes, yes in the voting booth. Not like he didn‚Äôt announce what he was going to do."
"sadly, they did their google searches after he won, how backwards is that?"
"No no no no  no no to tariffs 
No to tyranny 
No to the felon 
No to Elon Musk and trump"
Well they said yeah when they voted for him.  He said he was going to do this on the campaign trail
That support number would be closer to 0% if people actually knew how tariffs work and what a trade deficit is.
"This seriously feels like Idiocracy. ""Look at this, it's bigger than this other number."""
"they elected him to be in charge, there are consequences of their actions and they will pay for it .."
Enough of you guys BS survey. This guy is so horrible and I am sick and tired of you guys not calling out the admin BS but instead you guys walk the rope. Give real news and call facts instead of these ridiculous surveys that is ridiculous
"Trump mentioned that there would be some ""pain"" after he imposes tariffs. If you are a Trump supporter, clearly you are comfortable with this right now. But for how long? How much pain are you willing to endure? How much are you willing to watch others endure? And for how many months? Or years? How long do you realistically expect it to take before Americans can start to see their circumstances improve and to feel the pain subside? Or, could there ever come a point where the pain has become so unbearable, and has lasted for so long, that you would finally dare to stand up and say: ""Enough, Mr. President. Enough. This is not working."" Could there ever come such a point? Or would you just loyally endure the suffering forever, like a beaten dog that would never even conceive to leave its master..."
The US needs to be alone in the world for a while.
Can Canada turn a switch OFF for a day?
much too late now. the only solution is impeachment.
38% support is wild.
Get those MAGA wallets and purses ready to pay more‚Ä¶ You get what you voted for‚Ä¶zero sympathy from me.
We Canadians stand in solidarity with the American people . Against these absurd tariffs
Be careful what you wish for America!! You can‚Äôt tariff the entire world!!!
"Tariff wars lead to economic collapse. What in the world are the 38% for tariffs thinking, or not?"
Take pictures of your grocery receipts today so you can see what they are a year from now.
Media should do more to educate the public. TARRIFFS COST AMERICANS
Screw you CNN. You should have pushed to defeat him.
"How did some people ‚Äúmiss‚Äù this during the election campaign? DJT talked about tariffs nonstop during the campaign like he talked about everything else. Is this another case of sanewashing, rationalizing or making excuses for him like some usually do?"
I was advised to diversify my portfolio among several assets such as stocks and bonds since this can protect my portfolio for retirement. I'm seeking to invest $250K across markets but don't know where to start.
Impeach Trump!
Reporter needs a raise the way he explain this 
Make America Trump and Elon free
It really has the same effect as taxes. The government takes the money and the citizens pay the price. The foreigners don‚Äôt pay a dime.
"What's even more disappointing is how Trump's rhetoric has really twisted the facts.  The only reason that the US has a trade deficit with Canada is because of the volume of lower cost crude sold from Canada to the US.  If you take that out of the equation, the US is the one with the surplus.  There is no logic to this approach, especially given that Canada is the United State's largest customer.  Despite this episode, we Canadian really do cherish our neighbours to the south, which is partly why this stings so much."
"Look, just start calling it TRUMP TAX already. That's the only way for MAGA to understand. Watching from Europe, btw."
"Canada should be imposing bans not just tariffs. I would like to see Canada ban american dairy, pork, chicken, beef and fish to start. Then corn, wheat, barley and fruit. The US is forgetting that the much needed uranium to run your nuke reactors and ships comes from Canada."
"If people think Canada does nothing for the united states, the last thing you EVER, want Canada to say is, ""I'm sorry, for what we are aboot to do to you."""
I want to see his University diploma. He has no understanding of what tariffs are about and how they work.
Americans are not saying no no no. You‚Äôre saying no no no because you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
They voted for this struggle.
"Trump said exactly what he was going to do, even laid it all out in writing.  So anyone that voted for him deserve to have their costs going up, deserve to have their children's free lunches, head start and other programs taken away, deserve to have their healthcare costs to go up.  They voted for it."
"MAGA supporters, is this what you voted for? "
"I love that Trump is the one who negotiated the last North American trade deal and now he's saying ""America is being ripped off""! "
Yeah well you voted for him. Can‚Äôt say he didn‚Äôt warn you.
Glad to hear  Americans are against elons wishes !
Canadian's are not happy. Seeing it everywhere.. Haven't seen anything like this over here. Many feel betrayed
I can't watch these hacks anymore.
"""There are more searches for tariffs this week than for Taylor Swift"" has me crying, lmaoooo"
This is also polling BEFORE the prices start to go up.  Watch this number jump dramatically after weeks and months
"How do 38% support tariffs? Trump is unstoppable. These number should be something like 15% supported, 70% oppose, 15% indifferent."
Were can Americans vacation this summer. North Korea. OR ruisa.
Wow well if only the people who oppose the tariff didn‚Äôt vote for him when he was campaigning and talking about it all the time.
You chose this President so don't complaint now 
they already knew this when they voted?
"Canadians need to stand together, buy Canadian and avoid  US products and services.  Canada needs to find other viable trade partners that honour contracts and leave the US behind.
THANK you Japan and that‚Äôs just a start  Go Canada!"
"Don't look at me, I didn't vote for him!"
The whole of Canada is united on this
Importers will just pass the cost onto the consumer.
As an American I DO NOT stand by Trump Tariffs!!!
Massive insider trading. It's illegal!
you get what you vote for
I don't understand how the richest country in the world has been ripped of wtf 
But Americans voted voted voted for trump the terrible. And for those who didn't vote for him. I am truly sorry.
"Americans don't notice this but only in your country would a graph showing complex Economics data be dumbed down for Tarzan to read it showing two sides labeled ""Good"" and ""Bad."" You crack us up in Europe "
This is what autocrocy looks like
"First it was Brexit, now this... self-inflicted economic wounds - What were the west thinking?"
I support it. Other countries need to pay what they owe us.
"WHAT tariff man is implementing tariffs? Im so surprised

The man who said tariff was the most beautiful word in the dictionary, the man who said he would replace all taxes with a universal tariff... is implementing tariffs?"
losers learning about tariffs after election
"He doesn't care, care, care. Canada needs to start issuing sanctions."
"Heys guys, the people voted for exactly what he ran on which included Tariffs. What's not to understand? He said he would do it and the people clearly mandated it."
To whoever voted for trump I bet you feel like a CLOWN! 
Make Americans Gasp Again? 
"Gosh I‚Äôm mad!!!!!! Canadians are known to be the nicest people on earth but pleaseeeee Let us be bad for just few days, few weeks or few years. Please forgive us but we have to!"
38% still don‚Äôt understand how tariffs work
The tariffs are what Americans voted for. This was not a secret. 
This is exactly what they asked for. Apparently a majority of people in this nation seem to have to pee on the electric fence themselves to learn it hurts.
What isn't this what they voted him in for???
Americans are just watching...
38% support the tariffs?! Who are these people?
I was talking to my friends who work at Chevy dealerships the other day and they see what's coming with these tariffs. It's not good folks.
And a substantial percent of the 38% still think these aren‚Äôt consumer taxes.
I'm pretty sure there's a very different way to do things but he probably chose this way to feed his ego
Tax their whiskey. Get the attention of congress!
"Since Trump took office, there seem to have been more unfavorable results in America. These results include effects on the markets, such as price declines and sharp increases in inflation, as well as bank failures. I wonder if the sudden increase in interest rates will help value investors or if it would be wiser to stay away from the stock and financial markets for the time being."
"The nations suffers because those who can‚Äôt afford a cyber truck let alone eggs thinks a game show host will fix their poor life choices. 
Amazing"
This the same guy that said Harris was in the lead trump got a 10 point spread off the bat
Try polling REAL Americans
"When he says they owe us a lot of money and I'm sure they're gonna pay, he's mimicking the mob bosses from every 1940's-70's gangster film we ever saw. And I'm sure he's found a way to get them to pay HIM."
"Those are cnn polls, not antional polls. Trump campaign about tariffs and america gave him the mandate to do so."
Long time since I've seen comments this uninformed. The US people are clueless because nobody ever educated them on tariffs.
These the same pollsters who gave Kamala a chance?
"Canada should IMMEDIATELY put a 50% Export Tariff on Canadian Oil, Energy, Potash, and Critical Minerals 
Or simply TURN off these Commodities to the US
Donnie says he doesn't need Canadian commodities... we'll see üá®üá¶"
I can‚Äôt believe 38% want it?!
Why is the approve number for tariffs so high?!  They must not know how they work!
"Trump e o alzheimer Dementia is a chronic, progressive condition that affects memory, reasoning, language and behavior."
"The risk he's taking is fascinating. If it plays out well, wtf."
"Are you asking the same individuals that said, Trump has no chance of winning...The Trump supporters, are not fearful of tuff times, and understand sacrifice is a gimme in any war..."
"It‚Äôs fascinating that the complete narrative isn‚Äôt being shared. Why should we permit other nations to impose steep tariffs on our goods? and not do the same, by raising tariffs , this creates an opportunity for negotiation vs doing nothing and giving all of the countries a free pass."
The only thing that tariffs do is make everything more expensive for the average person.
"BREAKING: Trump pauses tariffs on Mexico for one month after Pres Claudia Sheinbaum agrees to reinforce border with 10,000 Mexican troops"
"Why would people think that it's a good thing to increase tariffs and pay more for everything.
Not to mention that higher tariffs will cause manufacturers in the US to shut down.
Then you have the tariffs wars between the US, Canada, Mexico, and China."
"Good thing nobody pays attention to ""Polling Data"" anymore"
"We will find new markets , that is what countries will do"
The world should stop trading with the Banana Republic of the United States
Ooohh‚Ä¶ this didn‚Äôt age well. Typical.
"Who is saying tariff is good? What's wrong with them, it should be 0%."
America really needs to get rid of President Musk and Boy Wonder Trump once and for all.
this pole like harris 55 % a head pole?
This didn‚Äôt age well.  Thousands of Mexican and Canadian troops sent to help protect the border. Mission accomplished
"Some peoples are wasting time, No No No don't mean nothing to him js in his campaign promise, so why now No No No ?"
"Damage is done, folks. Of course the big corporate customers for US goods and services will be back. The two economies are naturally so integrated. But the individual Canadian consumer is pissed off, and will hold that grudge."
"Yeah, when taking into consideration your credibility... DISCARD"
Erase trump
You all voted for this. The rest of the world has ran out of sympathy and respect for you. We‚Äôre done with you.
38% is still a high number of people who agree. Who would that demographic be?
And we're saying no no no to CNN
Here we go again messing up the stock market‚Ä¶.  Way to go trumpsters‚Ä¶.
üá®üá¶So happy many Americans are smart enough to know the negative outcome of tariffs!!üá®üá¶
If people in America agreed on everything President Trump did he would be a bad leader.. Thank you President Trump for doing what's best for the American people.
"Pay attention,  this is how a true negotiator works !  Watch how someone who knows how to negotiate works.  Here we are
less than 24 hours later and they all caved !  So sit down and let someone who knows what to do work for the American
people.  That's what voters voted for..  NO more business as usual !  America 1st,  not last !!!"
"He is using the tariffs to negotiate, exactly what he has been saying all along.  And now look, 30 day pause on both canada and mx.  Mx is already sending 10k troops.  You people are so gullible and read a headline and chase after it.  He is a billionaire business man and is smarter and more successful than all of you on here. So chill he does what he needs to do to negotiate"
"I did not vote for Trump and I do not support Tariffs, I have told everyone that it will be a disaster!"
Because you poll people who were given false infotmation about the tariffs.
It has not been a month yet and all this just keep adding up. We are going to have a lot of struggling times ahead of us here in America.
"Republicans, you voted for him. "
What's wrong with paying extra 25%
No one in America wants to pay higher prices for imports because of Tariffs. Period.
Yeah bullshit we 100% fully support them furthermore we think trump needs to double them! He ran on Tariffs and he had 60% support when running and won
When more people Google searching for tariffs than Taylor Swift got me rolling  
3:34 They should have known how they work already.
DADDYS HOME!!!
It is way too early to see how this works. Propaganda at its best. I‚Äôm a stock trader and trust me time is the keeper.
It's not just Americans who doesn't want tariffs.
And this was just a poll done by and for the democrats?

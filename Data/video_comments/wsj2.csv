President Donald Trump often cites the 25th President, William McKinley, as an inspiration for tariffs. The ‘McKinley Tariffs’ were some of the largest hikes in U.S. history, but in his second term, McKinley changed his mind, and argued for more free international trade as a way of helping the U.S. economy. …

Note they didn't do anything in this piece to show the link that can come from tariff and income inequality  -  by he late 19th C tariffs led america into the Gilded age - super rich oligarchs who BOUGHT American civil society - they owned the banks, the media, the politicians, and levers of regulation - and was one of the greatest periods of income inequality in the US (and the world). America started to wean themselves off Tarriffs as they had saturated their on markets - when America reached for Tariffs again in 1930 with the economic downturn, it crashed the economy and led to the great depression.

Actually, the three Rs fit into Trump's methodology just fine.  He'll pursue revenue on Monday, restriction on Tuesday, reciprocity on Wednesday, and then on Thursday he'll deny any of it ever happened and call it a plot against him.  We went through this for four years.  It's utterly predictable.

Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..

Trump likes to say that tariffs won't raise prices, but the whole purpose of tariffs is to raise prices, so people won't buy cheap foreign goods, but more expensive American goods that are only cheaper than the foreign goods because of the tariffs. He says that foreign companies will lower their prices, so tariffs won't actually make foreign goods more expensive, which means that the tariffs won't help American companies make more money by being cheaper than the foreign goods. He is actually saying that he is doing it for the tax revenue and not to help American companies increase their sales. 

On the other hand, tariffs other countries put on American products will mean lost sales for American companies or they will have to lower their prices too to counter-act the tariffs. Either way, they lose money.

No, President William McKinley did not abandon his tariff policy. He was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. As a Congressman, he was responsible for the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect American industries. Later, as president, he signed the Dingley Tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in U.S. history until the 1930s.

However, McKinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. He began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. This was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage U.S. exports.

Why Was McKinley Assassinated?
McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. Czolgosz believed that McKinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. Inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the Pan-American Exposition. The president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on September 14, 1901. His assassination led to Theodore Roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the Progressive Era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy.

Global manufacturing wasn't as specialized or technical as it is today. Moving a wool mill or tin smelting is very different than moving auto or computer chip or even labor-intensive tasks like clothing that favor low wage countries.  You improve domestic manufacturing through investment, building modern automated factors that require little or no labor inputs and thus can compete with the global price against the developing nations. Tariffs doesn't create this investment, tax breaks or even stimulus does.

While I liked the insight and history of McKinley's presidency and tariff policy, this video omits that the America that President Trump resides over is not even remotely the same type of economy as it was back then. And the video skips the nuances of the differences between how his policies would actually impact the three R's (Revenue, Restriction/Protectionism, and Reciprocity) versus how McKinley used them in the 19th century. Also the government revenue chart is misleading, because both Income Tax and Tariffs primarily are paid by Americans, not foreigners. And it just affects Americans at different rates. Income Tax is more progressive (affecting wealthier people more (allegedly), whereas Tariffs are more regressive (affecting poorer people more).

I think that this media piece is saying is that tariffs can be used to achieve specific limited goals.  However, they are a Tax on the average consumer.  Also, one must consider the negative effects on other related industries.
   I think that the way to best use them in this day and age to increase the federal inflow (or decrease the deficit), is to combine them with automating (& increasing the use of AI) the federal government as much as can be and increase the tax (significantly ) on those billionaires who benefitted the most from the new technology they created.

It's ironic that the 1 policy Trump has been the most consistent on even decades before he became a politician is believing that tariffs are always good for U.S. businesses. Then again, he failed/bankrupted multiple businesses before becoming a politician, so it's not too surprising he stands by enacting tariffs regardless of what economists say. Tariffs can work effectively if used sparingly/selectively, but when you put broad tariffs on all goods from a specific or even multiple countries it makes foreign made goods more expensive, as well as U.S. made goods that include foreign produced parts.

I get the point about McKinley saying at that time tariffs weren’t the answer and now the most was global cooperation and they were no longer necessary because we had a large surplus. What everyone is failing to recognize is that we aren’t in those times now we have a massive deficit and we gave up too many important sectors of us manufacturing. Trump just wants to bring that back as well as use them as a threat to make country’s more malleable to his goals.

I don't see a problem with government surpluses. Use them to build up a reserve. When the economy takes a downturn, as periodically happens, spend from the reserve to stimulate it instead of doing that with borrowed money. Other countries have reserves, why shouldn't the US?

The tarriff plan will evidently lead to high inflation, the high inflation is a significant reason why most retirees have sleepless nights. The increase in prices of everyday items puts them at risk of running out of money. As prices rise, the amount of money retirees can withdraw from their retirement savings also increases.

The economy and industry of the US and globally during McKinley’s era was vastly different to that of today. Consumerism dominates our economy today and domestic industry has essentially been wiped out in the US over the last 70 years. Asking Americans that overwhelmingly buy goods made in China and other overseas manufacturers to now buy goods made in the US, if there are any left, will exponentially raise the price of those goods, or, raise the price of those goods by virtue of tariffs. This is just another way to increase revenue that will ultimately be paid for by the average taxpayer and avoids having the billionaire class and corporations from paying their fair share of taxes.

As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run.

The Wall Street Journal’s dismissal of Trump’s tariffs as “the dumbest trade war” ignores their strategic leverage in reshaping North American trade and security. Far from reckless protectionism, the policy has already pressured Mexico to deploy troops against fentanyl trafficking and incentivized trade shifts that align with U.S. interests. These tariffs are not just economic penalties but a calculated effort to force concessions on critical issues like immigration, drug enforcement, and manufacturing imbalances.

Beyond diplomacy, tariffs serve a broader goal—reducing U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains and reviving domestic industries. With 42% of auto parts sourced from Mexico, targeted tariffs encourage reshoring, strengthening states like Michigan and Ohio. Selective rates, such as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy versus 25% on other goods, further reveal a nuanced strategy protecting key sectors without fully severing trade ties. This push for economic sovereignty is a response to vulnerabilities exposed by global crises, ensuring long-term resilience over short-term economic discomfort.

Critics who champion free trade often ignore its failures, from stagnant wages to the U.S.’s $180 billion trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. Just as Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs led to USMCA negotiations that strengthened labor protections, these tariffs could force necessary reforms. Markets, too, have proven adaptable, with initial stock market dips stabilizing as businesses adjust.

Labeling this strategy as simply “dumb” oversimplifies a complex, high-stakes negotiation. The real question isn’t whether tariffs cause disruption—they always do—but whether that disruption secures lasting economic and security advantages. If it does, then the short-term pain is a price worth paying.

On a popular radio talk show they said we needed to have an income tax back in 1913 because tariffs didn't provide enough revenue. they also said that tariffs only brought in 10% while DUTIES on tobacco and alcohol provided the rest. So, here we go again with the word duties, just another word that means the same thing as a tax or a tariff with the same intent, raising money for the government. How about we change income tax to income tariff or WAIT, income duties. I suggest we choose one of these words and drop the other two, so we can all be on the same page., especially those of you who say tarff's only worked then, but not now, just a play on words.

Tariffs are a tactical approach, not an overarching strategy. That is why during his first Presidency from 2018 through 2020 the trade war with China was a fiesta-del-failure for the United States which hurt the Supply Chain. The damage was only worsened by the Pandemic in 2020 which aggravated the availability of certain goods and catalyzed the increase in prices. I can understand the goals of the tariffs, but, without a strategic backbone, this can only be another foreign policy failure that will hurt common folk in the long run. And like explained in this video, you cannot achieve ALL goals concurrently.

Protectionist policies implemented during Mao Zedong's tenure proved detrimental to China's economic well-being, contributing to widespread poverty. The late 1970s marked a turning point when Deng Xiaoping moved away from this model. This shift towards market liberalization in the 1980s sparked a period of unprecedented economic growth in China. However, under Xi Jinping's leadership, a more cautious and state-centric approach, reminiscent of Mao's era, has emerged, potentially tempering the pace of this economic expansion.

In fact Roosevelt continued on with Mckinley's Tariffs and was a big supporter of Tariffs and he ended up on Mount Rushmore. A tariff is a tax and a tax is a tariff and the both start with TA and are one in the same in raising money for governments. People say tariffs or should I say taxes used to only work 200 years ago, but not now, so in essence then  taxes which are tariffs worked then, but not now, but this is BS.. It's rich that Democrats are complaining about Tariffs now, since they support high taxes, or should I say high tariffs on business which then passes the cost down to the consumers who they claim to care so much about, but this BS too.

The WSJ is in such a rush to try and debunk protectionism that it has oversimplified the history shown here and seemingly not grasped the point of McKinley's approach to tariffs throughout his career.


1. McKinley never ""abandoned"" tariffs. He negotiated with other countries and cut deals where it benefitted the US economy, especially in the wake of the Panic of 1893 and even his final proposal came only after the growth of competitive domestic industries ready for international competition. 

2. The US was running a surplus during McKinley's presidency, but we were not yet debt free. The last time we were debt free and running surpluses was in 1835 under Andrew Jackson. But that's beside the point. It would take a very long time to service our debt even with a modest surplus, and if we did begin to service the debt it would open up a greater portion of our government budget to spend on other things that benefit the public, or allow us to reduce taxes to moderate the surplus and strengthen the economy.

3. Any tariff policy would necessarily be results driven and rely on a more robust,  results driven plan to strengthen America's competitiveness by restoring domestic industry. Tariffs should of course be adjusted when appropriate. If tariffs are raised to protect and revive certain industries in the United States, we can expect prices to rise for a time before subsiding as we see production closer to our own market grow. Once this period passes, we will be in a stronger position to exercise reciprocity and can moderate our tariff policy where it best would benefit our economy.

We're not the small growing nation we were before though. Americans love their options, don't actually care about buying American if it's even a little more expensive than another product, and things are so international now that buying any new appliance or car or whatever would absolutely have some part or labor from another country. That's gonna jack our prices up, but Americans won't see it improving things for themselves

The tariffs also only worked during a time period where we were mostly farmers. We were exporting much more than we were importing. That’s not our current system now (it’s the complete opposite), so if he were to impose a bunch of tariffs on the imports it would dramatically hurt us. 
Why doesn’t he focus on bringing back jobs and focus on that first? He’s trying to jump the gun and he’s missing a crucial step!

The first element to understand is that the US economy is the world's biggest, therefore it can buy the most.  So, it is not possible for there to be balanced trade, anymore.  Comprehending this principle is like realizing you have a trade deficit with the supermarket or gasoline stand.  

There are more principles, of course; to include exchange rates, national fuel needs, supply chains, commodities based on dollars, what have you.

Use common sense.

The ""chicken race"" policy he has adopted when it comes to tariffs is not going to work for ever and can somebody inform him that it is now more than 24 hours since he became president. You can dupe just for so long and when that curtain falls, it falls forever.

Tariffs are bad, but what is the answer? Pay TSMC to build factories in the USA? This cant be the answer. You cant let the gouvernment decide which industries are important enough to support them. Lets say in an alternative world China conquered taiwan and stopped all chip supply to the USA. So you dont use the internet, computers, machines... for months? maybe years?

In france the gouvernement knew that computers are important and put so much money in it. Do you know any computer components which come from france? No? I dont eighter... China pushs some industries with tax money to make them competitiors world wide. Now our industries have to battle product cost which cant be fight with because they have no communist state putting all the money in. So how can we compete?

Mckinley's America is totally different from today's America. Back then America was industrializing itself meaning there were already manufacturing industries in place to protect. In that sense, tariffs make total sense as they protect domestic industries in their infancy. America as de-industrialized as it is today lacks necessary infrastructure, skilled workers. Simply slashing tariffs on foreign goods will not do much in helping rebuild its industries.

We have a President, finally looking out for working man, families and Those on Government Assistance. He's stopped spending US money on immigrants and other countries and waste. He will redirect funds and save. And increase military since it protects America AND ALLIES who are not footing the bil. He will give Anerican taxpayers a break!

The difference was that the rest of the world struggled. Now, there are alternatives. Many U.S. companies also have factories in different parts of the world. For example, the iPhone is made in China. Bringing it to the U.S. will increase its price due to tariffs. But they won't stop making IPhones in china. They will maybe make more expensive version of it for USA market.

You all are purposely missing the point, if Tariffs dont work then how come we are paying high tariffs while everyone else is paying low tariffs! We are paying 5-50% to mexico and sometimes 300% and lower to CANADA but Tariffs don't work according to your ""experts"" then why are we paying for them then? What your experts are really saying we want stuff valued cheap so we can get cheap labor and corporation wont be able to do that if we out Tariff them they will have to make there stuff here! There I fixed your argument! He is trying to get the economy to a point where we can drop income tax! But of course the WSJ wants everything to keep the same so they can continue to rob Americans blind and pay for cheap China labor!

So let me get this straight. Like a creditcard for example, you want me to accumulate more debt and make the minimum payment every month but not pay the creditcard off in full?  So if tariffs work and pays off some or all the national debt it’s a problem???  That logic is why i got divorced hahaha. I don’t like trump but if we have an excess of money and then go back to how it used to be to be (after we pay off the national debt) i’m not seeing the issue here. Seems like the old guard wants to keep maxing out the creditcard . I’ve been credit rich but would’ve always preferred being mostly liquid cash rich. Idk. I don’t even like Trump and i think, if this works it’s not a bad thing. Didn’t greece 🇬🇷 do this for a bunch of years and yes things went up in price but now reverted back? How many people who went on a credit binge when they were making $200k in a household and still paid the minimum on the card, both lost their job and wished they’d cut back and been more liquid to payoff that debt? Somebody correct me.

Both China and Japan are guilty of putting restrictions on the selling of goods in their domestic markets, but happily exporting goods to the West, for example cars. 
This is unfair, therefore selective tariffs could be used to encourage certain markets to open up. However scattergun tariffs, by a man with an ego, that dwarfs his intellect, are not a great idea.
The biggest issue for the USA / Europe is an issue of competitiveness, can we offer enticing, high quality products at a competitive price point? When it comes to EVs, even with subsidies to lower prices, the Western products are not clearly superior to Chinese versions, especially when it comes to tailoring to the tastes of the local culture.

Trump is right that tariffs would bring back manufacturing in the US and bring more fiscal revenues directly and indirectly thru more jobs paying income taxes. But where, IMHO he is wrong is to tariff Canada because the US needs Cdn natural resources in order to support their manufacturing industry and keep prices low. Tariffing Canada would push Canada to look for international markets et diversify away from the US. However, tariffing Mexico is understandable because Mexico’s links with China will create havoc in the US.

This is all true however I do think there is another side to this which for some reason everyone seems to be glossing over that trump does with tarrifs. Creating security (not depending on foreign adversaries for production) and using it as a major bargaining chip. The US has an interesting position as the worlds largest market of goods and so every country and their mother wants to import their goods there. We are also a heavy service based economy as opposed to production all of which is good and it helps when bargaining. If we threaten tariffs because we are a net importer countries will tend to lose any trade war they think about imposing or at the very least they'll be more hurt than the US consumer. This is why for example we saw trump threaten tariffs on Mexico and Canada. It was a strategy to get them to come to the table. The US cannot be the only country enforcing immigration and border policies and it worked. The other part of this is fairness. The US has close to no tariffs but many other countries in the world including the entire EU has loads of tarriffs on American goods and even services all while they don't pay the necessary fees to be in NATO so what does trump do? He threatens tariffs and talks it up making people think he is dead serious only for it to be a bargaining chip to force them to get a more fair deal. In this case he wants the EU to lessen their tariffs and open up more of their economies to US energy production to stop the reliance on Russia. China is self explanatory. They devalue their currency, steal patents, and use their government control to screw with American companies so using tariffs and forcing them to the table is also a good idea nevermind the fact its a major security risk to have almost all your military and domestic products reliant on a foreign adversary which is why the Biden administration and many foreign policy gurus and “experts” quietly supported it after trump left office.

What Happens When a Competitor’s Market Enters a Deflationary Spiral?
(Applying the VCEC Theory 2.0)

When a competing economy (e.g., China or the EU) enters a deflationary spiral, the following self-reinforcing cycle occurs:

1. Falling Prices Lead to Margin Collapse
Overproduction and weak demand force price cuts, but lower prices don’t stimulate new demand (especially for durable goods like cars or appliances).
Profit margins shrink, making it harder for businesses to cover costs.
Companies desperately cut costs, slash wages, and lay off workers, further reducing demand.
 Example:

Chinese EV makers slash prices, but demand remains stagnant.
Low margins force weaker companies into bankruptcy, and job losses weaken domestic consumption.

2. Capital Flight & Currency Depreciation
Investors pull capital out of the struggling economy to seek safer, higher-yield assets (often in U.S. markets).
The local currency weakens due to capital outflows and collapsing corporate earnings.
A weaker currency raises import costs, worsening profitability for businesses relying on foreign components.
 Example:

China experiences capital flight to USD assets, further weakening the yuan.
Higher import costs on essential goods (e.g., semiconductors, energy) increase financial strain.

3. The U.S. Economy Strengthens from the Spiral
Foreign capital flows into U.S. Treasuries, stocks, and real estate, strengthening the dollar.
A strong USD lowers U.S. import costs, reducing inflationary pressures.
U.S. consumers maintain spending power, while competitors suffer from currency weakness.
 Example:

The strong dollar makes imported goods (oil, semiconductors) cheaper for the U.S.
Tariffed goods become more expensive for the competitor but not for the U.S., as production shifts elsewhere (e.g., Mexico, Vietnam).

4. Trade War Intensifies: Tariffs & Market Fragmentation
The U.S. exploits the competitor’s weakness by increasing tariffs or restricting market access to slow their recovery.
A collapsing competitor’s market means excess supply floods into weaker economies, creating a race to the bottom in pricing.
Tariffs block competitors from dumping excess supply into high-margin Western markets, forcing them into low-profit secondary markets (Africa, Latin America).
 Example:

China’s EVs are hit with 100% tariffs in the U.S. and EU, forcing them to sell at near-zero margins in poorer markets.
U.S. and EU firms gain market share, while BYD and other Chinese firms face financial collapse before Tesla or Ford feel pressure.

5. Economic Collapse Triggers Political Instability
Widespread factory closures, job losses, and economic stagnation fuel internal unrest.
Government bailouts fail to restore growth, leading to long-term stagnation (Japan’s ""Lost Decades"" scenario).
Political leaders turn to protectionism, stimulus, or military posturing to distract from economic failure.
 Example:

China struggles to contain financial fallout from failing industries and introduces state bailouts, which only delay collapse.
Export-driven economies like Germany suffer as global demand weakens, triggering an EU economic crisis.

6. U.S. Firms Win the Long-Term Game (Innovation + Market Control)
The U.S. absorbs capital, talent, and investment, further expanding its tech and financial sector dominance.
Companies in AI, semiconductors, and autonomous vehicles accelerate their lead over struggling competitors.
Full self-driving technology, AI-driven supply chains, and automation create new economic moats that competitors cannot match.
 Example:

Tesla, Google (Waymo), and U.S. AI firms dominate self-driving and Edge AI, making low-cost EV production irrelevant.
China’s focus on cutting EV prices becomes obsolete as AI-driven vehicle networks reshape the auto market.
Final Outcome: The U.S. Turns the Competitor’s Crisis into a Self-Reinforcing Economic Advantage
 Deflation in a competitor’s market weakens their ability to compete globally.
 Capital flight strengthens the USD, lowering U.S. import costs and sustaining domestic consumption.
 Tariffs block competitor recovery, forcing them into financial ruin before U.S. firms feel pressure.
 Technological dominance (AI, self-driving) becomes the real economic battleground, rendering low-cost production irrelevant.

 Final Take: If China or another major competitor falls into a deflationary spiral, the U.S. absorbs global capital, strengthens the dollar, blocks economic recovery through tariffs, and advances AI dominance—cementing its long-term economic supremacy. 


with targeted tariffs, you get to shift the supply chains and keep the value chain
reciprocity is only important if you actually have viable exports which the USA doesn't have
for revenue is just  a tax 
reciprocity should come once he builds the industry

It probably would at least reduce the wasteful dispose-consumption and planned-obsolescence global economy.

More expensive means making consumers thinking twice before buying. Can’t see why it’s bad for reducing mindless consumption

Something must be done and Trump/Musk are business people.Government spending is taxation whether directly thru taxation or indirectly thru inflation, the hidden tax with money we do not have.  Non asset owners are really hurt by inflation especially last 4 years of spending money out of thin air.  GDP reflects government spending whether borrowed dollars or real money.  One reason USA GDP is ok but Americans feel poor last 4 years. Yes, inflation is doling but that means prices not rising as fast

"Trump pauses tariffs on Mexico, Canada for a month, but his threats spooked almost everyone: https://on.wsj.com/40NbqLQ"
"Protectionism needs an industry to protect. Without an industry to protect, Trump's tariffs just interrupted the supply chain for no purpose."
"It's actually shocking even now, how shallow Donald Trump's understanding of economics and history is."
I’m a US semiconductor worker. Our company is so globally intertwined it’s insane. It’s been that way for long long long time.
"Tariffs on steel in his first term: 
- created 1000 jobs in steel 
- destroyed 75000 jobs in automotive - because of expensive steel"
Did McKiinley .... sell made in china bibles ?
"Note they didn't do anything in this piece to show the link that can come from tariff and income inequality  -  by he late 19th C tariffs led america into the Gilded age - super rich oligarchs who BOUGHT American civil society - they owned the banks, the media, the politicians, and levers of regulation - and was one of the greatest periods of income inequality in the US (and the world). America started to wean themselves off Tarriffs as they had saturated their on markets - when America reached for Tariffs again in 1930 with the economic downturn, it crashed the economy and led to the great depression."
Tariffs can’t fund our economy because our country doesn’t look like red dead redemption anymore
Can somebody call the white house and let them know its 2025 and not 1896. Please & thx
Vast wealth for the rich not the common man
"Please be aware, that the revenue from tariffs is not coming from abroad, it is from the American people! It is in fact a penalty Americans pay to Trump for trying to use goods that were cheaper."
This is why Musk needs to purge the so-called experts out of the federal govt.  We can't have people like historians bringing up facts.
"I trust economists over Trump. If economists are saying tariffs are bad at the end, I will take it."
"Actually, the three Rs fit into Trump's methodology just fine.  He'll pursue revenue on Monday, restriction on Tuesday, reciprocity on Wednesday, and then on Thursday he'll deny any of it ever happened and call it a plot against him.  We went through this for four years.  It's utterly predictable."
"This a not the 1890's . Economies are completely different, intertwined and dependant on each other, which has built wealth for many nations. Why Trump thinks they work now is beyond the rational of economists and even the WSJ."
"The reason why we stopped by American Made Cars and appliances in the 80s and 90s, was because they were expensive and terribly made.  The quality of those products were horrible.  Let's not forget that."
"I can bet you a million yes million that some or the other intern went on chatgpt and searched. ""Tell me which US president was the best advocate of Tariffs and his name"" and chatgpt replied with Mckenly and they went on with it. Thats the only thing he knows about him. His name. Thats it."
Tariffs will increase costs of finished goods and components used throughout US manufacturing. This will be an immediate and huge hike in inflation. To fight inflation the Fed will have to hike interest rates which will be wonderful for the billionaires but possibly take away the middle class. Inflation is so high that consumers are literally taking debt for basic life necessities. Collapse has indeed begun..
Tariffs worked 200 yrs ago when USAs economy was way smaller... High Tariffs doesn't work now
The $64 dollar question here is ....American industry today.  Is the worker of today capable of the success in this economy as in was in McKinley's time ? Bring industry back ? Great ...but who is going to work ? We aren't making products from tin plate anymore.  Would expect that $64 was worth a lot more then too.
"Trump likes to say that tariffs won't raise prices, but the whole purpose of tariffs is to raise prices, so people won't buy cheap foreign goods, but more expensive American goods that are only cheaper than the foreign goods because of the tariffs. He says that foreign companies will lower their prices, so tariffs won't actually make foreign goods more expensive, which means that the tariffs won't help American companies make more money by being cheaper than the foreign goods. He is actually saying that he is doing it for the tax revenue and not to help American companies increase their sales. 

On the other hand, tariffs other countries put on American products will mean lost sales for American companies or they will have to lower their prices too to counter-act the tariffs. Either way, they lose money."
"It’s bad when the Wall Street journal criticizes the republican president, they endorsed."
I always wondered which era MAGA meant….
This man is going to tear apart the world
At this point hes just manipulating the stock market. He never planned to implement tariffs today. He wanted to announce it and then postpone them just before they appear. Watch him either implement the tariffs in a month and cancel them after or postpone them again.
"No, President William McKinley did not abandon his tariff policy. He was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. As a Congressman, he was responsible for the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect American industries. Later, as president, he signed the Dingley Tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in U.S. history until the 1930s.

However, McKinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. He began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. This was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage U.S. exports.

Why Was McKinley Assassinated?
McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. Czolgosz believed that McKinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. Inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the Pan-American Exposition. The president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on September 14, 1901. His assassination led to Theodore Roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the Progressive Era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy."
No country has achieved significant economic development through protectionism policies.
"When the Wall Street calls out Trump's  tariffs as ""The dumbest trade war in history"" I would listen to them rather than Trump's lies."
This WILL HURT the American people / our economy
"All the ‘smart money men’ on Wall Street are shocked at the stupidity of Trump’s tariffs. He said he’d do it - he wants to do it , he’s a moron and they said and did nothing."
"At least McKinley had the smarts to realise when he was wrong.

This guy? Keep dreaming."
McKinley put tariffs on pots and pannes. Not on computers with complex supply chains
Fascinating segment! Difficult to conceive of a universe where a surplus was a problem. Might have to pick up that guy's book. Good work WSJ!
Running the government like a business shouldn’t be the goal. The government is for the benefit of the people and to provide services
If Trump doesn't read; who is telling him about President McKinley?
Been waiting for this
Who are the lawyers advising Trump on legal matters?
"Please explain how fiscal surplus is a problem. To me that does not make sense, what am I missing?"
"Remember.Once prices go up, they never come back down."
A good way to know the character of a president is to research the president he most admires. McKinley was one of the worst
McKinley tariff solved the problem of government having too much money.  Today’s government has huge debts.  McKinley tariff works when there was no income tax.
These tariffs won’t actually do nearly as much good as it will do bad and it’s just gonna be so sad that most people are gonna struggle even more over the next 4 years to afford basic goods.

"My dad, working in a factory, was able to buy his house at 25 and support a family of 5 people. ""yeah, yeah"" we have to believe the economists who say that we are better than before"
Hey quick question what happened to mckinley
"Global manufacturing wasn't as specialized or technical as it is today. Moving a wool mill or tin smelting is very different than moving auto or computer chip or even labor-intensive tasks like clothing that favor low wage countries.  You improve domestic manufacturing through investment, building modern automated factors that require little or no labor inputs and thus can compete with the global price against the developing nations. Tariffs doesn't create this investment, tax breaks or even stimulus does."

Is this the WatchMojo lady?
How did that end for  McKinley?
"3:17 ain't none a yas talkin about McKinley's pose in that photo, it's like ""hey there..."""
tariffs are a way to impose a national sales tax without calling it that.  The objective is to transfer the tax burden to the poor.
"While I liked the insight and history of McKinley's presidency and tariff policy, this video omits that the America that President Trump resides over is not even remotely the same type of economy as it was back then. And the video skips the nuances of the differences between how his policies would actually impact the three R's (Revenue, Restriction/Protectionism, and Reciprocity) versus how McKinley used them in the 19th century. Also the government revenue chart is misleading, because both Income Tax and Tariffs primarily are paid by Americans, not foreigners. And it just affects Americans at different rates. Income Tax is more progressive (affecting wealthier people more (allegedly), whereas Tariffs are more regressive (affecting poorer people more)."
"More than just tariffs, William McKinley versaw a period of American expansionism, including the annexations of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and Hawaii. Trump is indeed inspired by him."
hey whatever happened to president mckinley...oh
"Good Lord, he just renamed Denali through Ex Order after him.  They freaking talk about it on Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
Millions of us pray that his presidency mirrors McKinley’s.
"What was the world producing on 1896, and what the world's produce now! It's like comparing a kids Toy kitchen with and industrial high volume kitchen is just insane"
"trump's goal is to bring the USA back to being isolationism, not to have an endgame goal, if we become isolationists again in 2025, we'll fall as an empire"
"it's crazy to me that at one point the US had TOO much surplus and had to REDUCE the revenue. That's insane haha. Can you imagine a modern day President saying that the budget surplus is too much? lol shoutout to Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland and William McKinley those guys were in charge of a protectionist but prosperous US at the time"
"This our opportunity to reintroduce slave labor as an economic tool! Rather than buying all of our goods from countries that rely on slave labor, we should just let a bunch of people in the country that are willing to work for pennies on the dollar!"
Well those taxes are definitely helping the poor and middle class said no one ever 
"Ok, WSJ, some of us(including you) may hate Trump's Tariffs... but the reality is Mckinley never abandoned tariffs, he just adopted reciprocity agreements in his second term - which is what Trump is doing. Mckinley allowed for reduced tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. However, this was not an abandonment of tariffs but an adjustment to improve trade relations while maintaining protectionism. He sadly got assassinated in 1901. Let's not twist history."
"It's simple really.  It's a national sales tax, moving the tax costs from the wealthy to consumers.  It's a step in the direction of eliminating taxes on the rich to be born by everyone else.  Privatize the profit, socialize the cost."
Trump knows enough history to fill a thimble 
"tariff to bring in manufacture to the country = Yes if its 3rd world country with cheap labor , for the most expensive country in the world? Nahh, they rather pay the tariff instead moving that cost alot of money , not including the labor cost."
Thanks WSJ for exposing the weaknesses.
"hmmm, so I think the point that needs to be made is that tariffs only work if income tax is rid of from the system."
"Bottom Line: He wants to raise taxes on everyone to pay down the debt. Eliminate income taxes which disproportionately impact high earners, and add tariffs which will take a relatively bigger chunk out of those at the lower end."
What is the point of spending on non necessary objectives when you are in debt
Trump is the Dunning-Kruger Effect personified
"the only way this will work is if tariffs are based on purchased price vs ""declared values"""
Everyone's an expert. This is great! 
"What I don't understand is that if people want to buy domestically produced products, can’t they just do that? It's not like tarrifs make domestic products any cheaper"
What about the tariffs during the 1930's...?
"Canadians are cancelling holidays to the US.  30% of tourism to Las Vegas is from Canada. U.S. Travel Association says a loss of 10% of Canadian tourists to the U.S. will cost 2.1 billion in spending and will cost 14, 000 jobs."
Why don’t you indicate that it is US citizens who ostensibly pay the tariffs
I feel like none of the people in the comments understood the video
The Wall Street Journal Trump supporter. Now are repenting their support of the Mad King.
"I think that this media piece is saying is that tariffs can be used to achieve specific limited goals.  However, they are a Tax on the average consumer.  Also, one must consider the negative effects on other related industries.
   I think that the way to best use them in this day and age to increase the federal inflow (or decrease the deficit), is to combine them with automating (& increasing the use of AI) the federal government as much as can be and increase the tax (significantly ) on those billionaires who benefitted the most from the new technology they created.  These billionaires will continue to get rich, just at a much slower rate,"
"It's ironic that the 1 policy Trump has been the most consistent on even decades before he became a politician is believing that tariffs are always good for U.S. businesses. Then again, he failed/bankrupted multiple businesses before becoming a politician, so it's not too surprising he stands by enacting tariffs regardless of what economists say. Tariffs can work effectively if used sparingly/selectively, but when you put broad tariffs on all goods from a specific or even multiple countries it makes foreign made goods more expensive, as well as U.S. made goods that include foreign produced parts."
We don't have the human labor for the stuff anymore
He sure is a fool
I get the point about McKinley saying at that time tariffs weren’t the answer and now the most was global cooperation and they were no longer necessary because we had a large surplus. What everyone is failing to recognize is that we aren’t in those times now we have a massive deficit and we gave up too many important sectors of us manufacturing. Trump just wants to bring that back as well as use them as a threat to make country’s more malleable to his goals.
"Up til 1913 USA government ran on tariff taxes until income tax started 1913 as government needed even more money.  Tariffs under Trump bringing nations to the bargaining table as global trade needs fixing.  With any trade, union, country negotiations things must be worked out with both sides typically not receiving everything they wanted."
"Reciprocity doesnt work if China doesnt reciprocate since they have their own command economy tariffs that undermines any attempt for the US to have equal trade. The same applies to the EU which buys very few US products because of all their regulations on product standards. Everyone has to make changes for it to work with or without tariffs and the Chinese have refused to change for almost 2 decades now, why would they? They had the upper hand and no one was willing to throw them a hardball"
We all know what ended up happening to William McKinley.
Every McKinley will have his own Leon Czolgosz.
this guy is a laughting stock for the whole world and the smart americans. You get what you vote.
Bring back not just manufacturing but also services and aerospace maintenance from overseas
"When tariffs begin to tank the stock market and the economy, expect to cop out: ""Nobody knew that economics were so difficult""."
"Yeah the numbers don't make sense, there is not enough imports to tariff to even come close to income tax"
"Yeah. From surplus which can be used for all sorts of things to 36 trillion dollars in debt. It’s just because surplus is bad. 

Cmon WSJ…"
"I don't see a problem with government surpluses. Use them to build up a reserve. When the economy takes a downturn, as periodically happens, spend from the reserve to stimulate it instead of doing that with borrowed money. Other countries have reserves, why shouldn't the US?"
"As an European in a true developed country - not like America, I’m very happy Trump won. We needed the international laughing stock back to entertain us. It started very well during the elections with “they are eating the dogs”. 

Thanks America for this gift to the world."
"As a note: that anarchist was an unjustly sacked postal worker.
Food for thought"
"The tarriff plan will evidently lead to high inflation, the high inflation is a significant reason why most retirees have sleepless nights. The increase in prices of everyday items puts them at risk of running out of money. As prices rise, the amount of money retirees can withdraw from their retirement savings also increases."
he gave up on it because they were headed toward the first world war and needed canada's help
"This is quite simple, forget the USA"
Isolationism while China is rapidly increasing global ties is idiotic
"Feels like Trump fell asleep watching only a quarter of some McKinley documentary, and nobody told him what happened to the rest of it."
"The economy and industry of the US and globally during McKinley’s era was vastly different to that of today. Consumerism dominates our economy today and domestic industry has essentially been wiped out in the US over the last 70 years. Asking Americans that overwhelmingly buy goods made in China and other overseas manufacturers to now buy goods made in the US, if there are any left, will exponentially raise the price of those goods, or, raise the price of those goods by virtue of tariffs. This is just another way to increase revenue that will ultimately be paid for by the average taxpayer and avoids having the billionaire class and corporations from paying their fair share of taxes."
Why the f is the football World Cup in that disgraceful country/office...
Is it just me or does the narrator sound like Lindsay Ellis
What if trump’s presidency ends in the same way McKinley’s did? 
"As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run."
"This is a great summation of everyone’s thoughts on tariffs. Sounds great in practice and then eventually you realize it’s not worth it and kind of dumb. 

I posted something on this exact thing and the rest of trump’s economic policies."
"The Wall Street Journal’s dismissal of Trump’s tariffs as “the dumbest trade war” ignores their strategic leverage in reshaping North American trade and security. Far from reckless protectionism, the policy has already pressured Mexico to deploy troops against fentanyl trafficking and incentivized trade shifts that align with U.S. interests. These tariffs are not just economic penalties but a calculated effort to force concessions on critical issues like immigration, drug enforcement, and manufacturing imbalances.

Beyond diplomacy, tariffs serve a broader goal—reducing U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains and reviving domestic industries. With 42% of auto parts sourced from Mexico, targeted tariffs encourage reshoring, strengthening states like Michigan and Ohio. Selective rates, such as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy versus 25% on other goods, further reveal a nuanced strategy protecting key sectors without fully severing trade ties. This push for economic sovereignty is a response to vulnerabilities exposed by global crises, ensuring long-term resilience over short-term economic discomfort.

Critics who champion free trade often ignore its failures, from stagnant wages to the U.S.’s $180 billion trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. Just as Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs led to USMCA negotiations that strengthened labor protections, these tariffs could force necessary reforms. Markets, too, have proven adaptable, with initial stock market dips stabilizing as businesses adjust.

Labeling this strategy as simply “dumb” oversimplifies a complex, high-stakes negotiation. The real question isn’t whether tariffs cause disruption—they always do—but whether that disruption secures lasting economic and security advantages. If it does, then the short-term pain is a price worth paying."
Free Trade is one of the key principles of economic prosperity
Tariffs are a tax on consumers.
There was no China and Deepseek... at that time.
What the point of having a surplus ? He asks what’s the point of having money in safes. How about then you can cut taxes on the people. That’s the point. These people are perfidious
If we keep JPow in charge of the fed long enough we'll have to start printing the $500 bill again.  That'll get William McKinley some overdue recognition.
good insight. the medium/long term impact on tariffs will be a sharp drop in reputation of usa amongst its allies
"Too much money,is a bad thing..."
"There was no leverage in tarrifs in the 19 century because we did not have a trade deficit.

Leverage goes to the buyer, not the seller.

Comparing Trump tarrifs to McKinley tarrifs makes no sense."
"I can't take Trumpski seriously.
He's such a Clown .
But very entertaining "
Tariffs on daily goods=tax on the poor
"Thanks for the information. I am 55 already with not enough set aside for retirement, I’ve always been curious about the market and have seen folks who did well in the market retire early, most say they went in small and grew over time, but I do not have that luxury, I have a good capital but I do not know how or what to do to get good outcome, I am open-minded and would appreciate any helpful advice."
It will only slow down the economy of US
Smart job. Someone forgot to inform the WSJ it’s 2025 and not 1890. The world and global trade has drastically changed over a century ago.
We consume more than we produce we rely on retail more than what we make it won’t work
Tariff king Trump
If we ever had such  surplus of money why can’t that money go to the people? Much like it does in Norway
"Trump would stand there and tell the guy who literally wrote the book on traffics, is wrong."
"Tariffs is a subsidy to the lazy, money pinching, unimagenative, consumer skinning, inefficient."
"ow if it was the Luxury Trap, and someone came and looked at Europe vs. the US, then no one would have a serious conversation with Europe, they would talk to the US and say that they spend a lot more money than they earn. Because that's where we are. It makes no economic sense."
Before 1914 we got all federal income from tariffs then they introduced income taxes starting at 1% hitting over 90% in the 60s - theft.
"I have an idea.  Once all of the debt is paid off, why not gift Americans with grants, such as education and starting businesses.  More so than what is being done today.  Plus the extra money can go toward helping veterans, the homeless, the sick and so on.  Helping save our wildlife is also important."
Very good video
Surplus? Don't know what to do with it? How bout giving the money back to it's citizens. And if the country is getting richer than the citizens should too. Non different than those Arab countries that are crazy rich. All their citizens are taken care of. Wild.
No one talks about the great depression and ww2 after thr 1930s
Someone explain to Trump this is a bad idea
He meant that him and his friends are going to be even richer.
"On a popular radio talk show they said we needed to have an income tax back in 1913 because tariffs didn't provide enough revenue. they also said that tariffs only brought in 10% while DUTIES on tobacco and alcohol provided the rest. So, here we go again with the word duties, just another word that means the same thing as a tax or a tariff with the same intent, raising money for the government. How about we change income tax to income tariff or WAIT, income duties. I suggest we choose one of these words and drop the other two, so we can all be on the same page., especially those of you who say tarff's only worked then, but not now, just a play on words."
I love paying import tariffs and passing them on to the average consumer! (No we can't make stuff here overnight.)
"Tariffs are a tactical approach, not an overarching strategy. That is why during his first Presidency from 2018 through 2020 the trade war with China was a fiesta-del-failure for the United States which hurt the Supply Chain. The damage was only worsened by the Pandemic in 2020 which aggravated the availability of certain goods and catalyzed the increase in prices. I can understand the goals of the tariffs, but, without a strategic backbone, this can only be another foreign policy failure that will hurt common folk in the long run. And like explained in this video, you cannot achieve ALL goals concurrently."
Tariffs = terrible tulips
"""The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act is now widely blamed for worsening the severity of the Great Depression in the U.S. and around the world.""  The last ""tariff war"" extended the great Depression for years, it was only due to Keynesian economics that they got out of if, of course WW2 helped..."
Okay so let’s tariff- pay off the war on terror- and switch back once the debt repayments isn’t higher then defense spending.
What was the problem with  having government surplus in those days prior to income tax?
A man who takes the lessons of history to a whole new level...
A BA from Wharton is a polite way of saying you flunked out from the MBA program that your daddy donated $2 million.
Trump is going to use them in a way that this expert is not taking into account. He is doing it by country!
It's pretty impressive how Trump got the GOP to adopt a massive tax hike.
"Late 19th century. The era of tariffs, non consecutive presidents and something else… how did McKinley’s term as president end?"
"There's a scene about this in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"""
The best thing was that the GOP got clobbered at the mid-term elections following the recession caused by the tarrifs. If only Trump had gone to class at Penn.
When Wall Street journal said you messed up then you messed up.
tariffs are essentially a rug pull/ bait and switch
Remember we are still subsiding farmers from trumps last tariffs 
Too much money? Social care anyone? Health care anyone? Good public schools? There is no problem with surplus anywhere.
"Following McKinley, but which version will Trump choose – hike or cut?"
Wall St. needs Treasuries. They would not be happy with a surplus.
"The Hawley, Smoot Act didn't work either according to Ferris Buehler's Day Off."
Very interesting video!
"He didn’t read the whole bio, just the foreword and no one made a movie"
"Protectionist policies implemented during Mao Zedong's tenure proved detrimental to China's economic well-being, contributing to widespread poverty. The late 1970s marked a turning point when Deng Xiaoping moved away from this model. This shift towards market liberalization in the 1980s sparked a period of unprecedented economic growth in China. However, under Xi Jinping's leadership, a more cautious and state-centric approach, reminiscent of Mao's era, has emerged, potentially tempering the pace of this economic expansion."
"If the Chinese are going to be paying for the tariffs, then stuff from Temu instead of being 80% off would have to be 90% off. Otherwise, Americans would have to buy the stuff for only 70% off."
"I believe you can never have too much money. They say we can't afford things like universal health care, but when we have a surplus we can, among other things like lowering taxes. I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about the past."
"Protectionism was a way to shelter industry from foreign competition. Once industry was large enough and could compete globally, they were abandoned. But what does Trump hope for? That America will compete with China on manufactured goods? Or Canada with oil?"
"The world of 1890 is incomparable to the world of 2025 !

Today’s American workers want high wages and easy jobs ! How can American workers compare with workers in developing countries if they cannot endure hardship ?"
Udder words - been dere done dat
"In fact Roosevelt continued on with Mckinley's Tariffs and was a big supporter of Tariffs and he ended up on Mount Rushmore. A tariff is a tax and a tax is a tariff and the both start with TA and are one in the same in raising money for governments. People say tariffs or should I say taxes used to only work 200 years ago, but not now, so in essence then  taxes which are tariffs worked then, but not now, but this is BS.. It's rich that Democrats are complaining about Tariffs now, since they support high taxes, or should I say high tariffs on business which then passes the cost down to the consumers who they claim to care so much about, but this BS too."
It is embarrassing in australia as our highest mountain is named after a general in Washington's army. It should revert to its indigenous name just as americas highest mountain must be called Denali the first nations name and not McKinley. In alaska almost everybody refers to it as Denali.
"Here’s an idea: Raise tariffs on large-sized product industries, then loan a portion of that revenue into local investments into small growing industries

If you believe the foreign industries are dumping goods (selling goods to other countries at below global market price to gain market advantage), create a commission board that will investigate and penalize dumping with excise taxation"
"Tariffs are a great way to raise revenue if most of your economy is powered by imports.  Trump is correct here.  Yes there will be short term disruption, but in the end it will be a steady stream of revenue for the US"
Tariffs are taxes. Any Republican that supports them is no Republican.
"The WSJ is in such a rush to try and debunk protectionism that it has oversimplified the history shown here and seemingly not grasped the point of McKinley's approach to tariffs throughout his career.


1. McKinley never ""abandoned"" tariffs. He negotiated with other countries and cut deals where it benefitted the US economy, especially in the wake of the Panic of 1893 and even his final proposal came only after the growth of competitive domestic industries ready for international competition. 

2. The US was running a surplus during McKinley's presidency, but we were not yet debt free. The last time we were debt free and running surpluses was in 1835 under Andrew Jackson. But that's beside the point. It would take a very long time to service our debt even with a modest surplus, and if we did begin to service the debt it would open up a greater portion of our government budget to spend on other things that benefit the public, or allow us to reduce taxes to moderate the surplus and strengthen the economy.

3. Any tariff policy would necessarily be results driven and rely on a more robust,  results driven plan to strengthen America's competitiveness by restoring domestic industry. Tariffs should of course be adjusted when appropriate. If tariffs are raised to protect and revive certain industries in the United States, we can expect prices to rise for a time before subsiding as we see production closer to our own market grow. Once this period passes, we will be in a stronger position to exercise reciprocity and can moderate our tariff policy where it best would benefit our economy."
Those tariffs where paid by who? 
We cant continue to do the same thing like what we were doing....we had to change we keep raising a  higher gdp to debt ratio....we had to experiment and try something else. The biggest problem is we are the consumers of the world....the world needs us otherwise without us the whole world would go bankrupt. Trump knows this and understands this very very very well.
This can be further explained in Ferris Bueller's Day Off by his history teacher!
Yes! Let’s go back to that era! Mckinley was assassinated.
Good presentation. Thank you.  Also the McKinley Tariffs led to Hawaiian Monarch being overthrown by USS Boston Marines for Sanford Dole.
"Well, when it only benefits the most rich, things usually does not work out, in the long term.
And the fact is, America does not have the infrastructure, the knowledge or the manpower, to make it work."
"I think it's worth noting how tiny the US GDP was in 1890-1900. That $8 million you see in the chart isn't a typo. Even adjusted for inflation, it's about 2% of what it is today."
"I'm not an economist, but you'd think that the simple trade of turning tin ore into tin plates isn't exactly comparable to, as an example, building a car, which is doing to require dozens and dozens of different kinds of materials, being sourced and refined from completely different locations, with a production cycle presumably far too complicated (not to mention where the materials are mined, which is going to vastly differ in profitability with location) for one site to complete from start to finish.

I'm sure there  tarrifs that can be great for modern economies, but unilateral isolationism seems like an insane relic of the past"
You know it's crazy when Uncle Rupert uses his platforms to speak out against something Trump is doing
"Honestly with all that chaos and instability created by Trump,
what reason would any business have to stay in the US not to mention to invest into it?"
Becuz tariffs will cost Americans a lot it doesn’t lower prices it raises prices
I hope this isn't the only thing Trump has in common with McKinley.
"I'm imagining him saying he's lalways been a big fan of McKinley"" once he was told about the tariffs thing, and decided to go with it without reading his story till the end lol"
"If the government is running a surplus they couldn’t just loan money out to other countries, fund programs various social programs and invest in growing and current industries."
"If you call your self a conservative, you cannot believe in Tariffs. FREEE MARKET BABY WE LOVE A FREE MARKET."
WSJ is in a lost cause! McKinley persisted but had to make some concessions because Democrats won more seats.  And the threat of tariffs on many items lead to bilateral dropping of tariffs and bans imposed on American exports to many countries.
America is wealthy. Its the wealthiest country on the planet. It just chooses not to distribute its wealth among its people. Its not alone in having a huge wealth gap but becoming richer won't make most Americans better off if the uber rich won't share the bounty. In fact the regressive nature of tariffs is likely to widen the wealth gap.
The law of self preservation is not the highest but the lowest law of nature
"The traitor needs to be impeached, removed, imprisoned for life!"
"Making this comparison today vs 125 years ago is insane. The world is a different place, and we definitely have something to do with the money if we have extra."
Didn't he know what happened at the end of the McKinley tarriff?? They priced themselves too high and gop lost 93 seats.
I rather have a surplus. With the surplus the government could use that surplus money to help the rest of the world as long as United states people are doing great. I do not see what the down size of being a surplus.
"William McKinley, the 25th president of the United States, was shot on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York, on September 6, 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley died on September 14 of gangrene caused by the wounds."
"Why didnt they invest the surplus into social welfare programs. Back then there was still slavery and segregation so, unlike now, this wouldnt have benefited the black population."
Can't you find a reader who does not sound like a high school student presenting a term paper?
Tariffs are an idiotic idea they just don't work.
Theres like 0 advantage of Tariffs unless you can bargain stuff
Mexico and Canada gave nothing and he folded.
Haha. Tariff? Still tariff? Our clock did not stop for the past decades!
So we're paying a 10% tariff on top of a 12% income tax.. so that we can fund lower corporate tax rates. 
"Watching this makes more sense now... However, I do not believe that tariffs on imports will generate sufficient revenue in the present. Can anybody tell if it will?"
Maybe now American manufacturing of tin plate can finally recover.
Tariffs because the only other way is to compete in a global market.... with Trump at the helm what could go wrong ???
Not quite understanding whats wrong with a surplus of tax revenue 2:10
"working honestly and friendly can earn money.
working by oppressing and attacking other absolutely also can earn money.
but in the end oppressing other is only temporary, later on the ""other"" that being oppress will find alternative partner.
this is logic and no need rocket science."
Lower taxes with a surplus 
"tariffs will crush wall street before it crushes anybody else, good luck with that, big orange dude!"
"I still dont get how too much revenue is bad. Like spend the money on the country, give people extra money. So many things that can be done. I must be missing something."
"Tariffs and more Tariffs, until the playing field is level."
Hey WSJ. You were in full suppport for donald trump. Now you reap what you sow and you've destroyed all of us who didn't vote for this idiot
"Interesting twist, McKinley abandoned his own policy! "
You said it yourself @6:30. We need protections
"The American peole knew how to take care of McKinley, let's hope they know how to take care of Trump similarly."
"You can have it all,  but you cannot have them all at once"
"If tariffs are so good for making money... Why did he delay tariffs for mexico and Canada??? 

I thought we were trying to fix the economy???"
China and Russia are having a field day with this presidency.
"The pendulum has swung too far and now everything is made overseas. And now we're saddled with taxes on our own property, let alone income. The imperial tax collector must go."
There is no comparing the United States of today with yesteryear.  The Wall Street Journal should have taken that into consideration!
"Tariff makes US GOVERNMENT rich, not US people"
"Consumers will pay the high prices, stay tuned they are coming up soon."
You can't have both revenue and restriction. Period.
Tariffs are a Tax and any Tax must start in the House.
"If he, & President Musk keep it up, they're gonna get McKinleyed"
McKinley got clapped in my hometown.
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't McKinley the President that got killed before Teddy Roosevelt?
"Tariffs in and of themselves are awful. Free markets are undefeated. But if tariffs can be threatened to get what he wants that’s a plus for the country, it’s not all that bad."
Hoover signed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act that contributed to the Great Depression.
How many horses during mckinley years that made familys  poorer and did the hay come from different countries? It was a different time
I love the idea that the US government was in trouble from not being in enough debt
"We're not the small growing nation we were before though. Americans love their options, don't actually care about buying American if it's even a little more expensive than another product, and things are so international now that buying any new appliance or car or whatever would absolutely have some part or labor from another country. That's gonna jack our prices up, but Americans won't see it improving things for themselves"
This video made my views on Tariffs more complex. They have their benefits and problems. It's not perfect
If Wall Street says it bad you know it’s good 
"Americans are so polarized. When they’re good, they’re really good. And then the unhinged"
So in other words the tariffs worked. And by the way... his anti tariff speech was the day before his assassination
"Thats why America is running on debts!  Bring back the tariffs, bring back tje surplus!"
and he wants US to produce like in the late 1800s and early 1900s? with such a high cost of working wage? the factories are not gonna go up and stay competitive.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah..... How about reciprocation? How about tariffing those who tariff us?"
"""Abandoning"" is quite the spin. Some solutions are meant to be temporary. Some might prefer the term ""transitory."""
"Like the spoilt overgrown toddler he is, he only hears the first sentence of something and then runs off to do what he wants, with no regard to any consequences because he's been shielded from them all his life."
"The tariffs also only worked during a time period where we were mostly farmers. We were exporting much more than we were importing. That’s not our current system now (it’s the complete opposite), so if he were to impose a bunch of tariffs on the imports it would dramatically hurt us. 
Why doesn’t he focus on bringing back jobs and focus on that first? He’s trying to jump the gun and he’s missing a crucial step!"
"Only person who said ""William McKinley"" more was Karl Rove proof reading the galleys"
Im pretty sure it came out that the wsj was getting funding from usaid so um yeah.
"right now we are taxing ourselves to enrich others ( or a very small percent of people ) , tariffs aim to tax other to enrich ourselves ( the working class )"
"The first element to understand is that the US economy is the world's biggest, therefore it can buy the most.  So, it is not possible for there to be balanced trade, anymore.  Comprehending this principle is like realizing you have a trade deficit with the supermarket or gasoline stand.  

There are more principles, of course; to include exchange rates, national fuel needs, supply chains, commodities based on dollars, what have you.

Use common sense."
I thought tariff rates didn’t fall until 1913?
"47 must read the Reader’s Digest Book of Ameriican Presidential Policies. On immigration, see Andrew Jackson; on economy, see William McKinley. On total failure check Millard Fillmore with 45-47 footnote."
It was the 1890 midterms not 1892
I thought Herbert Hoover was the tariff king.
Gotta love the reference to quack economist Art Laffer. Lol never change wsj
"The disadvantages of tariffs is pretty straightforward. The whole point is it would hurt the other countries more, and the current admin knows it. It was always a bargaining strategy from the beginning, and it's working. Got to give the admin that whether you agree with everything or not."
"In 2016 there were 120 000 employed in steel making. In 2025 its still 120 000. Tariffs did nothing.

. There are 1.5 million Americans employed by Walmart"
"His ideas are increasingly alarming folks.
The annexation of Gaza is the latest example."
WSJ clueless about tariffs ! 1835 under Andrew Jackson we had zero deficits and zero income taxes our income came from tariffs ! Income tax only became permanent in 1913 ! Duh !
"Instead of starting a tariff war, try to come to a better reasoning how to prevent criminals ruling the streets. If you accuse one person for stealing an apple how can you involve others who have nothing to do with the theft ? This is a great start of seeing Mckinley part 2 episode falling down."
Not a trade war but a drug war
"like a train wreck in slow motion..... I believe I am witnessing the implosion of the ""greatest"" nation on earth"
1890 America is exactly the same as 2025. 
"Obviously, Trump missed the point about McKinley’s untimely ending!"
Didn't McKinnley get assissinated?
"Might be time for a list of all the major countries in the world that have the highest tariffs on imports. Looks promising!

Congo, Rep.  18.2%

Equatorial Guinea  18.2%
Cameroon  18.1%
Belize  18.1%
Djibouti  17.6% (2014)
Chad  16.8%
Gabon  16.6%"
We should restart the whaling industry.
Super interesting
basically a TARIF(F)  is nothing else  than  a list of items and their prices .when you're  in a restaurant checking out the menu you're looking at a tarif  nothing to do  with  taxes         thanks 4 sharing
"The graph is interesting. Those excise taxes are not nil, and the President’s home State of Florida uses them instead of income tax. The Hotel Tax has been very lucrative, albeit more erratic revenue than an income tax IMHO."
"Tariffs are a tool and like any tool, if they are used, they would be used for a particular purpose.  If you try to use tariffs on everything, it's like using a hammer when you should be using a screw.  It's not going to work and you are going to damage whatever it is that you're trying to fix."
"different time, different era."
So basically it’s a giant tax. Not as complex as I thought going into this video
4:57 You can still change course Elephant!
We can lead a horse to water but cannot make them drink.   They’ll wake up when it’s too late. XAI315K is the future of finance and AI
"Maybe McKinley isn't the best president for Trump to idolize, all thing considered."
"If you're government has a surplus surely that is when you invest it, either in long term things that will bring returns over decades and secure the wealth of the country for the future, or into better things for the country today, like build a railway or something that will result in long term improved transport and wealth and make lives better for people. Also reduce taxes but do the first 2 first"
Except the threats of tariffs are working exactly as planned
This only happens if the tariffs give the government a surplus of cash. Have you seen our national debt?
Psssssst.... Its not 1897 anymore WSJ.
The guy who wrote the book about tariff thinks he knows more about tariff than the one who actually implemented it like Trump? How silly he is...
Hopefully the tariffs are just a bargaining chip
"He, he. The problem for Trump and the rest of the American people seem to be how to be be able to change from day to day. The question arises: Do he take consultation or think before he speaks, ever? The ""chicken race"" policy he has adopted when it comes to tariffs is not going to work for ever and can somebody inform him that it is now more than 24 hours since he became president. You can dupe just for so long and when that curtain falls, it falls forever."
How can Trump be the tariff King when he hasn't really done anything with it
"I don’t know what’s scarier:

Trump imposing Tariffs without knowing the consequences of them or Trump imposing Tariffs knowing the consequences, and not caring."
And we know what happened to McKinley 
"Again, Trump is dumber than a box of nail. USgovt was much smaller then so tariffs could handle the job."
He's been driving his business into the ditch for a long time. He will do the same to the US economy
They took down a mckinley statue in the city i live in.
Hello people:  tariffs are TAXES!
The orange man is a genius
Whatever happened to McKinley anyway?
"Oh good, the title of Tariff King fits right in with his self proclaimed King of Debt title.  It explains why he knows so little about either.  Looks as if he picked up a book in McKinley but put it down after reading only 1/2 of it."
Is the wsj part of the problem?
It wasn't the same era.
He didn’t speak against it.
Why doesn’t it surprise me Trump’s fave presidents are McKinley and Jackson?
"Revenue is NOT based on imports coming in - the gained revenue is paid by the consumer, dummy - so all it is is a redistribution of wealth toward the rich by the poor"
Tariff = Revenue. Restriction.  Reciprocity.
"McKinley. ...  lol McKinley... McKinley?  has anyone ever heard of McKinley?  if President McKinley was so great, people would remember him.  Where is McKinley on Mount Rushmore."
I'm shopping only Canadians products forever and ever no more returns to import products
I'm curious how much has DT read about and talked with economists about tarrifs .... their pros and cons.
Lol how is not having to pay taxes bad???
“Abandoned” or forced ?
5:55 after he accomplished what he wanted he changed tactics..nice
"Insulate yourselves for the rough times ahead, my friends. It's gonna get worse before it gets worse."
"My presidential idols are George Washington, Teddy Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. Weird choice, Mr. Trump."
This video oddly neglects at what point tariffs are levied and who ultimately pays them. It seems to tacitly imply that they'd be a means to replace income tax without mentioning that they're more akin to a consumption tax.
You just know not a single republican would ever watch videos like these. Lol so sad.
I dont think Trump knows who McKinley is. His idol has always been Mussolini.
Where is the cheap kabour force coming from to work in these manufacturing and resource industries?
"US should just use tariffs on cheap counterfeit chinese imports like plasticware, merchandise and cheap drones"
Why Wall Street journal is so biased against trump
Funny you made it through this whole thing ignoring the way terrify played a role in the grate depression. I guess it’s no longer news.
Well @ 30 trillion in debt id say we don't have to worry about a surplus any time soon. So maybe surplus era methods like excise and predominant income tax revenue is no longer feasible in our modern time
"I really love your videos. They are very stylish.
However, I’d like to share my thoughts on the sound design. I feel that making ultra-fine adjustments on the scale of 0.00X seconds could refine it even further. The intentional placement and pacing are already captivating, but I personally sensed that the flow could be ever so slightly improved. Really just a tiny bit."
200 years ago isn't today but 37 trillions dept is today !
"the word ""tariff"" is starting to loose all meaning like ""china"" and ""billions"""
You're not really rich unless you can afford a legion.
Know who doesn’t have complex supply chains…. Tesla
tariff king sounds like train wreck.
Targeted federal sales tax.
I wonder who told him William McKinley was
McKinley was also America's great imperialist president.
"Lol, like they wouldn't find a way to spend excess money. I'd bet my family's whole worth that will never be a problem again."
What will Amazon or Wallmart sell then?
Protective Tariffs
"We get it, WSJ. You’re against Trump. Hey, how about you talk about trade deficits? Did this guy say excess money “just sits in government safes”??? Must be an “academic economist”. That’s NOT how it works at all. Might want to interview another “economist” in future stories. Maybe this is the journalist’s old college professor."
"""He literally wrote the book...."" someone wrote the script, made the video and the script and video went through editorial review by ppl who work for WSJ, and we have a sentence like it came out of a tiktok car video of some woman complaining about her date."
"Tariffs are bad, but what is the answer? Pay TSMC to build factories in the USA? This cant be the answer. You cant let the gouvernment decide which industries are important enough to support them. Lets say in an alternative world China conquered taiwan and stopped all chip supply to the USA. So you dont use the internet, computers, machines... for months? maybe years?

In france the gouvernement knew that computers are important and put so much money in it. Do you know any computer components which come from france? No? I dont eighter... China pushs some industries with tax money to make them competitiors world wide. Now our industries have to battle product cost which cant be fight with because they have no communist state putting all the money in. So how can we compete?"
So they work
Billions of dollars… your 36 trillion dollars in debt. You haven’t enough years to see your country out of debt
The swift path to WallStreetCrash#2? The Big finance might just terminate this idea.
McKinley: the bloodthirsty conqueror.
"""Tariffs are going to make us very rich"". Yes, Donnie, Elon and oligarchs."
"As a Canadian I can hardly describe my hate for this orange man, or the people who voted for him."
Got in early because XAI315K is already predicted to pass $2 by June.
"How can a revenue SURPLUS be such a problem? I don't get it. This video describes it as if it's such an undesirable 'problem'. If the govt has a SURPLUS of money, isn't it a BOON? It means that the government can invest in other things, like infrastructure, or improving social services, or cutting taxes. How on earth can the WSJ describe this as a 'problem'?"
"I think it’s funny all the new economists in the country.  I will tell you a secret, trump is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers!!!"
What about the great depression???
I wonder if trump will go the same way as McKinley
Wsj gets called out constantly by trump 
#XAI315K to the moooooooon! 
"But WSJ is a Trump supporter media, and now you guys hate Tariffs? "
"Trump must have an economist that graduated from Trump school, that he is listening too."
Watch Ronald Reagan's speech about tariff MAGA might learn a thing from a former republican president
Yeah apparently consumers suffer tariffs directly but you change your posture once we start talking about taxes. How about an episode on secretary mellon next time? We can then compare your logic in this video with the one on taxes
"Why are other countries not abandoning their high tariff policies against US made goods if tariffs causes ""depressions"" ? If that was the case, every country in the world would be in constant depressions based on WSJ 's thinking."
"But the US grew thanks to protectionism. My God, free trade and globalization began with Reagan and that is where the decline of this country began."
"Why should the Country not have a surplus??
A savings in the case of war or any other emergency ️ we have a savings as any good household  makes a lot of sense to me."
2:20 use the money
"Mckinley's America is totally different from today's America. Back then America was industrializing itself meaning there were already manufacturing industries in place to protect. In that sense, tariffs make total sense as they protect domestic industries in their infancy. America as de-industrialized as it is today lacks necessary infrastructure, skilled workers. Simply slashing tariffs on foreign goods will not do much in helping rebuild its industries."
"Well, nobody has ever accused Trump of being smart. Once again he displays incredibly low intelligence, revealing that he knows just as much about tariffs as he does history."
I wonder why because I'm sure he knows or now that I think of it maybe he doesn't know that that guy was assassinated. Has anyone told him that or try to anyway not that he would listen
"The Laffer curve is an unproven, untested theory - a philosophy.  It's literally a napkin drawing.  No one has done any systematic testing (hard to do) or at demonstrated it using comprehensive empirical data. All I hear from folks that support bthe theory is a bunch of annectdotal, cherry picked ""evidence."""
LONG LIVE DONALD TRUMP
"A complete analysis needs to comment on the trade deficits we have been running for decades with other countries.  Some say they matter, some say they don't.  Trump thinks they do."
What’s next a return to whale oil lamps and transatlantic zeppelin flights?
One can dream Trump has the same ending
"Trump mind is firm and he will do it even it is a dumb idea (like The Wall ).  That's the reason why his business was never doing well.  Too bad this time, we all have to suffer from his stupidity "
"Rich people just trying to get a replacement for income tax. The only kind they’re even close to being held accountable for taxes with. Please discuss or read on your own Harley-Smoot tariff. Farmers, BOHICA !"
Trump best not go to Buffalo then
"I really wish that Trump would spend a lot more time in Buffalo, just like his idol."
"Inflation, inflation"
"Tariffs are bad for GDP in the short term. Any comment that denounces tariffs is solely focused on GDP in the short term, not the relative wealth gained by the average American from tariffs in the longterm"
Does WSJ know about the roaring 20s? Or the tariffs that caused it?
"Well, you need like a century to pay your debt...."
"At this point, he’s just creating so much volatility in the markets to make a profit either from shorting or going long, pays to be close to trump at this point"
"If you like this video. Economics Explained also has a great video on this in my opinion  title ""Can Tariffs Actually Work?"""
"McKinley? Well, then, perhaps history will itself if that's what he wants...."
"What ever he does, it will be disastrous.

Surely for the US, and surely for some trading partners, but hopely not for rest of the world."
Just like you did with all your other Companies!
"lol ,maybe Trump doesn't know that the world has changed, your not limited to a few commercial roads and transport of materials became way quicker around the world, and this day any country in the world is a viable commercial partner"
He will NEVER understand who pays
"Make the poor, poorer !!"
He’s trying to drag the country back to 1900
Trump: king of debt and tariffs. Not something a wise leader would want to be associated with.
Just in!  Trump to ban the Canadian National anthem at U S sporting events!!!
"Canada 🇨🇦 won the McKinley tariff  war , i guess trump didn't read that part?"
Looks like trump and McKinnly are opposite. Trump must have not finished the book cause I’m not sure he can read.
He was also shot at point blank range by a guy who thought he was told to do so soooo ️
"Poor Trump, his lack of Education has made his brain slow and unusable. I don't know who is writing his papers but I think, it might be him.  3 years and 10 months and the States can go back to normal. I will save a lot of money these next three years because  plan to keep all my money in my pocket and also, lose a lot of weight. No spending for me and no toys next three christmasses. I did the same thing during Trumps last term. :) Good luck America. Keep your money in your pocket.!"
"Well now we know where Trump gets his idea.  Again, the intelligence of a 3-year old.  Takes an idea and runs with it without thinking it through.  Its a different era now.  Completely different!  And as the economist analysts are saying, you can not have all three benefits at the same time.  Also couldn't help wonder if the same fate will befall Trump that happened to his hero.  At the rate things are going at this moment, could well happen.  Time will only tell."
Perhaps Trump should be told the end of McKinley's bio and if yall have forgot-----look it up.
Mckinley knows. Trump Doesnt 
Calm down and ride the wave Chicky
Hopefully Trump will follow McKinley into history !
"""The next decade, democrats switch to an income tax system..."" which president gonna undo that one for me?"
I’m sure this ended just great for McKinley and certainly won’t end up with our Fanta Father getting misted
We are hoping Trump has the same fate as Mackinley did during his second term and can come around on Tariffs
McKinley was the first president backed by billionaires.
XAI315K 35  or 3500 ?
You know what else happened to McKinley? 
"We have a President, finally looking out for working man, families and Those on Government Assistance. He's stopped spending US money on immigrants and other countries and waste. He will redirect funds and save. And increase military since it protects America AND ALLIES who are not footing the bil. He will give Anerican taxpayers a break!"
"The difference was that the rest of the world struggled. Now, there are alternatives. Many U.S. companies also have factories in different parts of the world. For example, the iPhone is made in China. Bringing it to the U.S. will increase its price due to tariffs. But they won't stop making IPhones in china. They will maybe make more expensive version of it for USA market."
"i wish the WSJ went back to do this kind of journalism in the print edition... I really miss this... sadly, you supported the idiot misusing all this knowledge..."
"Swapped out $8,000 to my XAI315K wallet. Thanks you guys see you at the summit."
"Lol, so, the moral of the McKinley story is, if you're a president that goes hog wild on tariffs... "
If everybody in the comments were as smart as Trump we wouldn't be in this mess so..........
Trump blinked
And why wasn’t this brought up DURING his campaign???  You guys are ridiculous
Trump believes in tariffs but not on his stuff.
My opinion on XAI315K it will reach double digits heights may take time but the hand writing is on the wall
Trump reading on his teleprompter is so lifeless!
I feel sick when ever I hear his voice
"He a fan of McKinley , Adolph , Regan & Putin ."
I like Trump comparing himself to William McKinley. Because we all know how he ended up.
Trump folded like his casinos
Who copy Leon Czolgosz?
So Trump is mackinley in reverse...
"Awww, poor WSJ, things aren't going your way, are they?"
Nonsense!!!  WSJ journalist found a critic and led him give his presentation without opposing views!
Absolute stupidity!
"lolz, I love that Americans think there will be midterm elections."
"If tariffs will get US companies to build in the US vs other countries, I'm for it."
Shhh you were supposed to keep XAI315K a secret. it's literally going to be a million dollar return investment
Ah yes. Trump mimicking McKinley.  How did McKinley's term end again?
MAKE TRUMP TARIFFS INCREASE MORE WOOOOHHHH!!!! USA USA USA
"Mr trump thinks USA is still agricultural society. Well, perhaps it soon is."
I trust trump and his meme coin….. 
"You all are purposely missing the point, if Tariffs dont work then how come we are paying high tariffs while everyone else is paying low tariffs! We are paying 5-50% to mexico and sometimes 300% and lower to CANADA but Tariffs don't work according to your ""experts"" then why are we paying for them then? What your experts are really saying we want stuff valued cheap so we can get cheap labor and corporation wont be able to do that if we out Tariff them they will have to make there stuff here! There I fixed your argument! He is trying to get the economy to a point where we can drop income tax! But of course the WSJ wants everything to keep the same so they can continue to rob Americans blind and pay for cheap China labor!"
McKinley is the worst ever
McKinley huh
Funny that Trump doesn’t remember how things ended for him. 
Such a clown 
he solved a problem that he created
"I hope McKinley and the 3rd Anti-Christ, the Lord of the Lies, etc have one other thing in common, also."
Tariffs will be Axe on foot by Gringos 
China / Largest manufacturing capability/ capacity….US / Largest National debt
That pumpkin spiced palpantine doesn’t understand economics god help us all lol
Fun times.
"It will be ""yuuuuuuuge"""
Yall know what happened to McKinley right ?
Always trying to talk smack on President Trump
I thought his idol was Hitler. Maybe Putin. Probably both.
"America, the richest and strongest country, will be rich and strong again... again? Lool"
You people are simpletons.
You guys are really milking these tariffs
Your reward for voting for me is higher prices and soon unemployment
Why not tariff Britain and France until they agree to service the trillion in loans that they haven’t paid a penny on since 1931?
Should be ronald reagan.. really it was the real win against japan ask lighthizer similar to china now japan is second largest econ back then
how wld ignorant trump know anything about McKinley?
1896 lol
NEGATIVE LIBERAL MEDIA
or what happens when you stop reading history books on page 100
a fool thinks he is a genius...........  what 77 million Americans were thinking?
"it's funny you think he has an idol. in multiple occasions he tried to paint himself as ""the greatest president.. everrrr"""
Wow
"When did he say it was his idol?
You know we're allowed to look into our past for inspiration right?
I like short hair and my right hand, doesn't make me a Nazi.."
trump also abandoned his tariff policies. two peas in a pod
Trump arguably dumber than 45.
"Why? he was assassinated, that's why."
William McKinley realised tariffs does noet work at all end reversed it and Trump want to try again is like hitting your head and do it again hahahaha
You have no idea how many union members and factory workers think this is a great idea.
So clearly he’s used tariffs as a bargaining tool
WSJ......WE (STILL) SUPPORT JOE.
"Mc Kinley ,whasn't dump as the 47 th dumpest "
What a joke
Trump is a simpleton!
Maybe Trump will meet McKinley’s fate
Yet another man 100 years behind the times
He was also assassinated... idk man
member what happened to mckinley...dude got popped...he gonna go the same route.
Someone was talking about how the US doesn't have any cotton mills anymore. So make bamboo underwear or invent a new textile. Stop making excuses and get creative and think outside the box. This negativity is going to kill this country.
What is the very stable genius doing?
he.was shot dead donnie
wow WSJ posted 10 videos on tariffs in 2 days. Hiding something?
O McKinley a cara do bolsonaro hahahahaha
why ? because of HunterBiden .
XAI315K UP 100% in last 24 hrs

Thought the 200% deposit bonus for XAI315K was fake? Elon Musk did keep his word 
This is 2025 
"he has no clue , ."
Mckinley sucked.
"So let me get this straight. Like a creditcard for example, you want me to accumulate more debt and make the minimum payment every month but not pay the creditcard off in full?  So if tariffs work and pays off some or all the national debt it’s a problem???  That logic is why i got divorced hahaha. I don’t like trump but if we have an excess of money and then go back to how it used to be to be (after we pay off the national debt) i’m not seeing the issue here. Seems like the old guard wants to keep maxing out the creditcard . I’ve been credit rich but would’ve always preferred being mostly liquid cash rich. Idk. I don’t even like Trump and i think, if this works it’s not a bad thing. Didn’t greece 🇬🇷 do this for a bunch of years and yes things went up in price but now reverted back? How many people who went on a credit binge when they were making $200k in a household and still paid the minimum on the card, both lost their job and wished they’d cut back and been more liquid to payoff that debt? Somebody correct me."
WSJ doesn't know anything.
"Trump is not using tariffs.
He is using the threat of tariffs.
HUGE DIFFERENCE"
Dump Trump. 
SO NOW the wall street journal is complaining about being too rich
Why did McKinley abandon his tariff policies? Because he had a brain. trump doesn't.
Elon just makes cars and shoots rockets into space. now he makes his crypto coin XAI315K xD you can't not love this guy
I believe Trump over this DEI narrator
"The two problems here that Trump is neglecting is that three presidents who were involved either with divisive tariffs or social upheaval that lead to either civil war or social unrest in America died in office: Lincoln, McKinley and Kennedy. He needs to be really careful. And I am not saying this to stir trouble. Trump is courting his own premature mortality."
this sounds like a vox video
WHAT A JOKE!
Really hope Orange Brandon pardons himself and First Lady Musk before he leaves office
Ha problem is Trump never finish the ahh book  wait till sees how it ended   
The excess money from tariffs should be used on a sovereign wealth fund
yall love bitching about everything 
"If tariffs are so bad, why did the last administration leave the tariffs on China that Trump put on them during his first term?"
Another President up for assination
Trump has a idealised fantasy of what McKinley’s presidency was like.
"Looking for meaning, thoughtfulness and strategy in the actions of an impulsive unprincipled disordered egomaniac is an exercise in futility."
. OK
Show us your dislike ratio lol
"Trump uses Tariffs to, or as a way to negotiate more than other things"
Can't you people come up with own ideas you have to take ones that have failed lol use your own heads and come up with something original seriously
Dopey Donald hasn't figured out that the world was a different place in McKinley's time.
Abolish income tax and replace with tariffs and other taxes like high luxury goods sales tax.
XAI315K about to 50x - Elon Musk dropped bombshell news
Trump is ignorant.
XAI315K reminds me of the GAMESTOP stock surge. This coin's definitely going to take off.
"Both China and Japan are guilty of putting restrictions on the selling of goods in their domestic markets, but happily exporting goods to the West, for example cars. 
This is unfair, therefore selective tariffs could be used to encourage certain markets to open up. However scattergun tariffs, by a man with an ego, that dwarfs his intellect, are not a great idea.
The biggest issue for the USA / Europe is an issue of competitiveness, can we offer enticing, high quality products at a competitive price point? When it comes to EVs, even with subsidies to lower prices, the Western products are not clearly superior to Chinese versions, especially when it comes to tailoring to the tastes of the local culture."
I’ve been making a lot of losses trying to make a perfect trading. I thought trading on a demo account was just like trading the real market. Can anyone help me out or at least advise me on what to do?
"Don't forget when Elon Musk said XAI315K is better than BTC.This remind us, BTC has no utility"
Make America Great Again! Lol 
"If these guys know so much more……how did they get us into such a terrible situation? 
Time will show who is right, but liberals wont abandon their delusions regardless."
"I see a lot of people trying to apply logic to the acts that they are witnessing.

Honestly, save yourself the time. 

We’re living in unprecedented times. 

What you thought might work or not work 50 years ago may or may not be true.

The fact of the matter remains, Trump is in power. He realizes it’s fleeting.

He’s doing everything he can faster than anyone ever.

Love or hate it, we need more world leaders who are willing to cut straight to the chase and address issues on demand"
Did Elon really make a new crypto coin XAI315K or something? Trump just mentioned it on the news
""
The market cap for XAI315K is not actually the amount of money put into a crypto. There are very aggressive market cap multipliers that kick in.
Trump is dumb.
Cope harder 
So much losing hahahaha hahahaha
Donald Trump is a Socialist!
Just bought more XAI315K after your guys video. I knew i wasnt crazy to see elon musk created a new crypto coin.
Talked about this four days ago on https://youtu.be/iInDJR0ASQA?si=-FgW2gySD7t-Uwpl
Dumb
I'll be so happy when (not if) XAI315K reaches $10
Lots of business moguls in the comments that seem to know more about making a dollar than the multi-billionaire 2 time president. Checks out. Let's go to Taylormade video and tell Scottie Schefler how to chip next!
"Your last video covering the presale bonus 200%. All i gotta say is thanks i'm $15,000 richer off my $3000 investment"
"Trump is right that tariffs would bring back manufacturing in the US and bring more fiscal revenues directly and indirectly thru more jobs paying income taxes. But where, IMHO he is wrong is to tariff Canada because the US needs Cdn natural resources in order to support their manufacturing industry and keep prices low. Tariffing Canada would push Canada to look for international markets et diversify away from the US. However, tariffing Mexico is understandable because Mexico’s links with China will create havoc in the US."
Felon is a stable genius.  He can fix it all.

They also share voluminous eyebrows.
"They just worked. It worked this past weekend. Not to mention the other tarriffs that are still in place from his first term... 
The mental gymnsatics it takes for Democrats to cope is genuinely stunning"
I've always been a WSJ Fan and typically the reporting has been fairly balanced. Has WSJ posted any videos about the positive things DJT has done since he took office?
Canadian here... fml.
"The Wall Street Journal doesn't even know the difference between ""insure"" and ""ensure""...

Disappointing."
If you missed the Bitcoin wave now is your chance to get in Elon Musk's XAI315K new crypto.
"Tarrifs are really his act of trying to get a country to talk, maybe he'll abandon his tariff strategy if he finds other ways to get a country to talk"
I dislike Trump. But I dislike the BS peddled by WSJ in the name of news even more.
"Fake news.
Don't care."
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"Just to be clear, though, did those tariffs work?"
"This is all true however I do think there is another side to this which for some reason everyone seems to be glossing over that trump does with tarrifs. Creating security (not depending on foreign adversaries for production) and using it as a major bargaining chip. The US has an interesting position as the worlds largest market of goods and so every country and their mother wants to import their goods there. We are also a heavy service based economy as opposed to production all of which is good and it helps when bargaining. If we threaten tariffs because we are a net importer countries will tend to lose any trade war they think about imposing or at the very least they'll be more hurt than the US consumer. This is why for example we saw trump threaten tariffs on Mexico and Canada. It was a strategy to get them to come to the table. The US cannot be the only country enforcing immigration and border policies and it worked. The other part of this is fairness. The US has close to no tariffs but many other countries in the world including the entire EU has loads of tarriffs on American goods and even services all while they don't pay the necessary fees to be in NATO so what does trump do? He threatens tariffs and talks it up making people think he is dead serious only for it to be a bargaining chip to force them to get a more fair deal. In this case he wants the EU to lessen their tariffs and open up more of their economies to US energy production to stop the reliance on Russia. China is self explanatory. They devalue their currency, steal patents, and use their government control to screw with American companies so using tariffs and forcing them to the table is also a good idea nevermind the fact its a major security risk to have almost all your military and domestic products reliant on a foreign adversary which is why the Biden administration and many foreign policy gurus and “experts” quietly supported it after trump left office."
" Hello from Bucharest, Romania - a huge underrated city in Europe:)"
This video is proving his point.
"I'm not able to buy American products most of the time. I usually make what I need from raw or recycled materials, but the steel and aluminum tariffs have made it more difficult to do since Trump initiated his tariffs war except he's not knowledgeable or experienced enough to do anything RIGHT."
"What Happens When a Competitor’s Market Enters a Deflationary Spiral?
(Applying the VCEC Theory 2.0)

When a competing economy (e.g., China or the EU) enters a deflationary spiral, the following self-reinforcing cycle occurs:

1. Falling Prices Lead to Margin Collapse
Overproduction and weak demand force price cuts, but lower prices don’t stimulate new demand (especially for durable goods like cars or appliances).
Profit margins shrink, making it harder for businesses to cover costs.
Companies desperately cut costs, slash wages, and lay off workers, further reducing demand.
 Example:

Chinese EV makers slash prices, but demand remains stagnant.
Low margins force weaker companies into bankruptcy, and job losses weaken domestic consumption.

2. Capital Flight & Currency Depreciation
Investors pull capital out of the struggling economy to seek safer, higher-yield assets (often in U.S. markets).
The local currency weakens due to capital outflows and collapsing corporate earnings.
A weaker currency raises import costs, worsening profitability for businesses relying on foreign components.
 Example:

China experiences capital flight to USD assets, further weakening the yuan.
Higher import costs on essential goods (e.g., semiconductors, energy) increase financial strain.

3. The U.S. Economy Strengthens from the Spiral
Foreign capital flows into U.S. Treasuries, stocks, and real estate, strengthening the dollar.
A strong USD lowers U.S. import costs, reducing inflationary pressures.
U.S. consumers maintain spending power, while competitors suffer from currency weakness.
 Example:

The strong dollar makes imported goods (oil, semiconductors) cheaper for the U.S.
Tariffed goods become more expensive for the competitor but not for the U.S., as production shifts elsewhere (e.g., Mexico, Vietnam).

4. Trade War Intensifies: Tariffs & Market Fragmentation
The U.S. exploits the competitor’s weakness by increasing tariffs or restricting market access to slow their recovery.
A collapsing competitor’s market means excess supply floods into weaker economies, creating a race to the bottom in pricing.
Tariffs block competitors from dumping excess supply into high-margin Western markets, forcing them into low-profit secondary markets (Africa, Latin America).
 Example:

China’s EVs are hit with 100% tariffs in the U.S. and EU, forcing them to sell at near-zero margins in poorer markets.
U.S. and EU firms gain market share, while BYD and other Chinese firms face financial collapse before Tesla or Ford feel pressure.

5. Economic Collapse Triggers Political Instability
Widespread factory closures, job losses, and economic stagnation fuel internal unrest.
Government bailouts fail to restore growth, leading to long-term stagnation (Japan’s ""Lost Decades"" scenario).
Political leaders turn to protectionism, stimulus, or military posturing to distract from economic failure.
 Example:

China struggles to contain financial fallout from failing industries and introduces state bailouts, which only delay collapse.
Export-driven economies like Germany suffer as global demand weakens, triggering an EU economic crisis.

6. U.S. Firms Win the Long-Term Game (Innovation + Market Control)
The U.S. absorbs capital, talent, and investment, further expanding its tech and financial sector dominance.
Companies in AI, semiconductors, and autonomous vehicles accelerate their lead over struggling competitors.
Full self-driving technology, AI-driven supply chains, and automation create new economic moats that competitors cannot match.
 Example:

Tesla, Google (Waymo), and U.S. AI firms dominate self-driving and Edge AI, making low-cost EV production irrelevant.
China’s focus on cutting EV prices becomes obsolete as AI-driven vehicle networks reshape the auto market.
Final Outcome: The U.S. Turns the Competitor’s Crisis into a Self-Reinforcing Economic Advantage
 Deflation in a competitor’s market weakens their ability to compete globally.
 Capital flight strengthens the USD, lowering U.S. import costs and sustaining domestic consumption.
 Tariffs block competitor recovery, forcing them into financial ruin before U.S. firms feel pressure.
 Technological dominance (AI, self-driving) becomes the real economic battleground, rendering low-cost production irrelevant.

 Final Take: If China or another major competitor falls into a deflationary spiral, the U.S. absorbs global capital, strengthens the dollar, blocks economic recovery through tariffs, and advances AI dominance—cementing its long-term economic supremacy. 


with targeted tariffs, you get to shift the supply chains and keep the value chain
reciprocity is only important if you actually have viable exports which the USA doesn't have
for revenue is just  a tax 
reciprocity should come once he builds the industry"
On today’s episode of WSJ’s: “WE HATE TRUMP!” Everything Trump does is BAD!”
It's because he didn't want to wait it out. Tariffs work. 
Marsha Marsha Marsha
Most likely he was just fed up with paying high income taxes and decided he could save a lot of money is we transitioned to only tariffs.
I don’t see why a surplus would be a bad thing. Besides it would take generations to pay off existing debt anyway.
Tariffs are a bargaining tool. All other trading countries use them against us all the time. We have a massive trade deficit.

"It probably would at least reduce the wasteful dispose-consumption and planned-obsolescence global economy.

More expensive means making consumers thinking twice before buying. Can’t see why it’s bad for reducing mindless consumption"
"""pay off the debt.... what's the point of that?"" - maybe the ability to reduce taxes and make ppl better off and companies more competitive globally?...the right of next generations to not be born with a debt burden...?"
"Donald trump is one of the best presidents of are lifetime. The border needs to be secured and

We went from taxing foreigners to taxing our own people with the stupid progressive income tax. This channel literally called a surplus a bad thing when we are 36 TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT!
I question the sincerity of Wall Street Journal as over educated women and minorities instead of unbiased facts.
Will be good in the long run
XRP is nice and all but with the new revelations of XAI315K - it's going to leave it in the dust. Elon Musk is the creator of the coin for god's sake
It’s worth a shot! We need to get creative and get America out of debt. Take care of our US citizens. Protect our borders. Gain more resources where we don’t need to depend on countries who’ve been mistreating USA with tariffs.
So he‘s not actually crazy. There’s a strategy to this Tarif idea and there’s a world where it’s good on the economy. Why did no one point this out before the election?
Took a chance on XAI315K stock and can't be more happy. This crypto will make millionaires
"Most presidents do not rock the
Boat too much as only a short 4 years.  Trouble is everything has come to a head with all the government spending and deficit spending past 4 years.  Something must be done and Trump/Musk are business people.Government spending is taxation whether directly thru taxation or indirectly thru inflation, the hidden tax with money we do not have.  Non asset owners are really hurt by inflation especially last 4 years of spending money out of thin air.  GDP reflects government spending whether borrowed dollars or real money.  One reason USA GDP is ok but Americans feel poor last 4 years. Yes, inflation is doling but that means prices not rising as fast"

We estimate the likely impact on U.S. consumers and find that by the end of 2018, import tariffs were costing U.S. consumers and the firms that import foreign goods an additional $3 billion per month in added tax costs and another $1.4 billion per month in deadweight welfare (efficiency) losses.

Guess Trump doesn't remember doing 25% Tariffs on steel in 2018. The Result: Steel employment went up 0.3%. But, production fell on steel made products such a appliances and autos by -1.1% then retaliatory tariffs dropped manufacturing employment down to -1.4%

years ago while in the Marines we would go to Norway and train every few winters. a lot of the Marines would take several extra pairs of Levi's or wrangler jeans that cost 20-25 dollars with them, and you could sell them for 80-100 dollars each with no problems. the reason for that is because Norway had such huge tariffs on everything American made and for the Norwegians to buy these same jeans in their stores it would cost them over 120 dollars a pair. other countries around the world have had huge tariffs on American goods for decades while we had little to none on their products coming into our country. it is only fair that we hang the same tariffs on other countries that they impose on us.

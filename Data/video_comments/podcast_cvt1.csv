The worst part is, companies are already talking about increasing prices more than 10%, just like they did in the pandemic. They know we are expecting increasing prices, so they will try to get the maximum they can squeeze from us.

One thing to add: U.S. companies also use imported raw materials, services, and hardware to produce their products. As the prices of imports increase, it also forces U.S. companies to raise their prices, which are already uncompetitive (Vacum example in the video), to make up for the increased cost of production. Whichever way you spin this initiative, it's going to be inflationary.

Thank you for the unbiased and informative videos!

It will still be cheaper to make in China even with 100% tariff. That is how large the cost gap is now. Meanwhile, US consumers will need to pay more without any new jobs created.

The scariest thing about this entire debate, is that it shows the world how woefully uneducated the average American adult is. We all assume that our neighbors are operating with a basic understanding of fundamental economic concepts. Yet along comes Trump, proposing an outlandish economic agenda that is severely flawed on face value, and half our nation is so financially ignorant, they can’t even discern policies that are financially ruinous to their livelihood. It’s so demoralizing.

Tariffs will raise the price of components and completed commodities utilised in US manufacturing. Inflation will rise sharply and immediately as a result. The Fed will have to raise interest rates in order to combat inflation, which will benefit billionaires but may deprive the middle class. Because inflation is so severe, people are actually taking out loans to pay for necessities. Yes, the collapse has started.

Also, to use your example, Walmart won't add $10 to the price, they will add $15 to the price so they can increase their profit margins.  We know this because of how many companies did it after COVID when everyone was using the specter of inflation to price gouge.  You can look at various corporate' profit margins.  It's right there in their financial reports.

In the interview at 1:10, Trump says ""..when companies come in and they dump their products in the US, they should pay automatically let's say a 10% tax.""

This proves that he really believes that the company that sells their product to the US is actually paying that tax. He obviously actually does not understand that this tax is paid by the US importers and, eventually, customers.

I was born and grew up in China, and lived there till I graduated college. Now I have been living in the US for nearly 2 decades. I want to share my own experience about those companies who imported from China.
We now are only talking about how the tariff hurts American consumers however I personally never a big fan of Walmart or any of those big import companies because they damaged Chinese people’s life even more.
Some of my relatives are doing exporting business in China and they’ve been doing  it for over three decades. When I was there, in order to keep a low price to sell competitively in the US, all those imported companies came to China, asked the lowest minimum price from all those tiny manufactories. Remember, this was at least two decades ago and tariff was low. 
In order to keep those big companies, all those Chinese manufacturers had to cut down the check amount to all the Chinese laborers, move the regulation bars, asking people to work 24/7 with three shifts. To remind you, those workers didn’t have any 401(k) or good health insurance, and some of them were asked to work part-time only. 
As a result, the environment got more and more polluted, people were still struggling at the surviving level two decades later. 
So instead of arguing whether we should raise the tariff or not, I see this tariff as a changing point - those big important companies needs to change because they are harming both countries, economies, and peoples lives and environments. 
I’m never a big fan of Walmart, and I always paid attention to where the product was made. 
I have personally witnessed how cheap kitchen utensils were made in my relatives factories, I felt so bad for those young laborers who didn’t have any personal protections at work. 
You have to understand that those cheap nail clippers, nail polish, kitchen utensils, kitchen knives, kitchen scissors were not made by any big companies in China — they were made by small factories that did not have any pollution protections or peoples health protections. 
They are now more and more so-called “ cancer villages” in China because of those pollutions. People didn’t know them because they “made the country face look bad.”
So as a result, I see this tariff as a challenge to those big importing companies, because it is definitely time for them to change how they do business in both countries now. It is painful to see how those companies hurting peoples lives in both China and the US. Thus said, I don’t see tariff is a threaten but a chance for both countries to work together for a better world.

I know I'm a couple weeks late to this.. it just occurred to me that I should probably figure out this whole tariff situation LOL. But I just wanted to say that with the political climate of our country right now, and all the craziness that's going on, the people in the comments are absolutely right. This was probably the most fact-based, unbiased, and actually educational and informational piece of content that I've probably seen in about 3 years. It was just nice to have a break from all the election drama for a  little while lol. Sometimes people don't realize that they tend to come off a little bit patronizing when they're trying to explain something to beginners of the subject. It's not intentional usually,  just the way it comes out. But this was easy to understand while still maintaining an educational feeling of you talking to me and not at me. Not everyone is able to teach this way, it's such a great skill. Great video great information. Thank you.

Tariffs benefit some but hurt far more by decreasing consumer purchasing power, increasing the cost of production for businesses that use imported products and passing that cost to the customers, and hurt domestic consumers due to the lack of competition which tends to push up prices, not to mention how the Chinese tariffs hurt U.S. farmers on soybean exports.

Great video. One additional thing I would add about tariffs and that is it tends to drive the prices up of domestically produced products as well. Let’s say with a tariff the imported goods cost 10 bucks, and the domestic is 9 bucks. All of a sudden the domestic product will sell for 9.99 because of that price gap created by the tariff. Also, product quality tends to go down as companies look for ways to slash costs.

I found this video to be a clear and informative overview of the consequences of tariffs; thank you, Brian. However, two points of clarification may help viewers understand this issue in a bit more depth.

At minute 3:50, Brian introduces competitive advantage as an explanation for why trade with partners who produce cheap goods is beneficial to the United States. While this may be true, the strongest argument in favor of free trade encompasses more than merely a benefit to a single country under a specific set of circumstances. Due to the phenomenon which economists call “Comparative Advantage,” it will always be beneficial for all countries to specialize and trade with each other, rather than trying to produce everything for themselves. International trade benefits all countries, regardless of whether or not a given country can produce goods more efficiently than other countries, because even the least-efficient countries must have a lower opportunity cost of producing certain goods compared to other countries. 

At minute , Brian poses the question, “Who pays the tariff?” and proceeds to assert that the consumer necessarily pays. While it is likely true that the consumer ultimately pays in many cases, the technically correct answer is: it depends on the price elasticity of demand of the good in question. The extent to which a company (Walmart in Brian’s example) can raise the price of the good to preserve its profit margin depends on the extent to which consumers are willing and able to pay more for that good.

Given that this video is a summary and not a deep dive into the economics of trade policy, it is understandable that those points were not covered, but hopefully those who wish to gain a deeper understanding will find this to be a helpful starting point for further learning.

It gets more complicated once you take into consideration the reaction of other countries. If they impose tarriffs in turn (on US imports), then two things will happen. 1- governments collect more taxes in the form of tarrifs. 2- global trade will decrease because it is more expensive. Looking at the world economy as a whole, it is difficult to see how tarriffs can be beneficial. To me they seem more like a drag on overall trade, just like other taxes.

An overlooked problem that contributes to inflation is that our standard of living is going down while the standard of living is skyrocketing in the countries we import from (China for example). This means our wages stagnate or go down while theirs goes through the roof comparatively. That can't be sustained for very long unless we start moving manufacturing back here.

An important thing to note is the disparity in prices and costs between the exporter and importer. If it was 10% or even 20% cheaper to make products in China and import them to the US then a 10% tariff may genuinely make some companies consider moving operations back to the US. However, in today's economy it's astronomically cheaper to do manufacturing in other counties - fractions of the price! No company is going to move back to the US to dodge a 10% or even 30% tariff. It would still be a worse situation for them. They're simply going to pass that cost along to the consumer. This isn't a debate or philosophical thing, it's basic math. My company manufactures electronic equipment in Taiwan and it would require a 150% tariff to even come close to making it fiscally rational to move ops back to the US.

Ah, I am yet two steps ahead of you sir, and I say that government 'should' be massively smaller, shrunk to the size where tarrifs alone (or nearly) can afford to cover the entire budget. The budget is out of control, shrink it to a reasonable size and we can then have a discussion about the need for additional taxes, if any.

I worked long enough for Walmart to take off, but they obviously got greedy in their profits and therefore abandoned for cheap foreign made inventory which also enabled them to really explode their profits and grow more.

Retail markups will include the tariff as part of the product cost:

$100 vacuum x 1.5 (50%markup) =$150

Nothing makes in the US is cheaper even after you added the 10% of tariff to the import products.  On the flip side other countries will impose tariff on the US export products too.  When China stopped buying US farm products Trump spent $49 billions dollars on US farmers.

You can apply this exact same logic on increasing the taxes on Corporations. The consumer always pays. Whether its taxes, tariffs, sanctions, etc. It's always the consumer. So the question is not if tariffs are inflationary. The question is are they more inflationary than raising corporate taxes?

Back in 2010, the average tariff China imposed on US goods was 8.09%. Some of our products were tariffed at a whopping 3,000%. So it wasn't like Trump suddenly imposed tariffs on the innocent Chinese government. He was simply evening the playing field a bit.

which makes us made good less competitive abroad.   For example, the US exports massive amounts of wheat.  Farmers can be devastated if tarrifs are put on wheat.

Don't forget retaliation by other countries.

Remember Trump 2018 taxes on steel and aluminum from EU countries.
EU targeted a few products from USA - one specifically was Harley Davidson. 
Importers of Harley Davidson motorbikes had to pay a 25% tariff - Harley Davidson lost important market, decided to start production in Thailand for avoiding those tariffs. In addition production costs in Thailand are much lower than in USA. 

Also on 2018 Trump tariffs on China - China stopped buying soybean from USA, replaced USA by other countries in Latin America for soybean and even more products. Total losses for USA are much higher than the expected tariffs. 
Additional option: China stopping deliveries to USA for a few products they have an almost worldwide monopoly, such as some of the rare earth metals.

In order to compete with these foreign businesses, we would need to innovate and use a technological advantage to outperform even the lowest paid foreign worker. We would then need to cut a lot of the unnecessary regulations imposed on us. Not the regulations that stops us from poisoning our water supply or products, but definitely the regulations that are intentionally anti-competitive and pushed by the corporate lobbyists. 

The issue is that we've given up on innovation and instead rely on unethical cheap labor. If we can innovate to make production both cheap and ethical, that would be the best of both worlds.

I believe you misrepresent the way Walmart sets the price in that example. It is not set to maintain an arbitrary certain gross margin of $50. Instead companies set prices at exactly the highest prices that customers will tolerate without changing goods. Walmart does not necessarily pass the 10 to the consumer instead Walmart must slowly inflate prices at the normal rate of inflation which is not set by supply and demand and is instead largely changed by the profit sentiment. A  $25 dollar swing on importing a product is unlikely to be immediately passed on. It gets baked into the overarching inflation rate which is not rationally set. 

There is no argument about gross contribution margin when raising current prices. Toyota raises its compact car prices because it can, because it sees consumers will cough up another 12k not because of tax and carry fees it’s entirely a game of spending psychology. 

I double down that a tariff is not immediately born by the consumer. The consumer already endures the highest price tolerable irrelevant to the underlying fundamentals of the businesses

This is a good breakdown, but I think we should also consider if this will be inflationary on goods made in the US. As someone who has worked for a parts supplier for an auto manufacturing plant I would encourage everyone to google what the inside of one looks like. Notice the robotics that move these cars down assembly lines. Ask yourself where those robotics are made. (It’s not the US)

The cost of production here in the US will also go up with a 10% tariff across the board. That will then also be passed on to the consumer. It also makes it more expensive to build new manufacturing plants in the US and keep them running. Company’s will keep the cheap labor and pass the cost on to consumers because it’s still going to be more cost effective than building entirely new manufacturing here. 

Targeted well thought out tariffs have had good results. 10% across the board does nothing but start trade wars and creates inflation. 

If only we had a successful recent example of how to create manufacturing jobs in the us to model policy on. Like, hmmm, I don’t know… THE CHIPS ACT PASSED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. It used TARGETED tariffs AND government incentives to build simi conductor plants in the us.

In reality, with the other Trump deregulation and making energy less expensive, tariffs are not going to make consumer prices higher for imports. Energy is over 15% of the cost of products.  Reducing energy prices by 50% of today's price for fossil fuels lowers the cost of production, transportation, warehouses, and distribution centers to the retailer.  Each level reduces their energy cost by 50% and lowers the retailer cost at wholesale prices.  Also, lowering income taxes puts more of their enings into their pockets. Deregulation creates incentives to increase productivity.  So, just addressing tariffs is not the full picture.

Competitive Advantage is an overstated scam, Bangladesh labour is $1/hr, US is $15 an hour but transporting the good across land and oceans will cost you say a few hours an hour and the profit goes to the US company charging as much for the goods as if they were made in the US. Basically the savings does not get to the consumer, it shows as profit to the company.

I like the example about the vacuum cleaners. 

In my opinion, it’s about longevity. That Kirby vacuum is likely to last much longer than the cheap Chinese vacuum due to a higher standard of quality control.

So if the Kirby vacuum last five years before breaking while the Chinese vacuum breaks after one year, you’ll end up spending more money over time by having to replace the Chinese vacuum annually.

Lastly, this contributes to our “throwaway mentality”. You’re likely to simply throw away and replace a $150 vacuum rather than a $500 vacuum. The $500 Kirby vacuum based on the picture appears to be constructed using higher quality materials, such as metal instead of plastic. That alone makes this item more recyclable.

I remember in the 80's with Chrysler going out of business, Imports went through the roof, but I thought to myself ""At least we make our own home appliances, pickup trucks and industrial trucks. Today we don't make ANYTHING. Samsung took over the appliance market, Japan took over the industrial truck market and an American car is a bunch of parts imported from other places. This country is not the same as it used to be. In reflection things were great in the 1980's and we thought it was bad.

Absolutely I agree. Get rid of IRS. Let me spend 100% of my money how I choose. Put Tarrifs I decide how I want use the money that will be collected in sale taxes (not income tax) or how much of my income I choose to spend every month. If I choose to be tight with my money it should be my choice not the government restricting my income by taxing me through income tax.

One main thing missing from this interpretation is the fact that there is a global market competing for business in the US.  It's not as simple as 10% tariff equals 10% more to consumer.  This opinion is missing a lot of other context.  But I know it's fun to think we understand the global economy better.  There are many many gears that contribute to economics.

So instead of importing the complete goods, he’s forcing a situation where, IF companies then have to pivot and develop domestic production of the same goods, they then need to import all the minerals and resources to build the infrastructure for said production, before even beginning the work that then would turn a profit. Not to mention then paying higher overheads e.g. wages. Ok, so all those jobs will increase the employment rate, at least in the development phase, but covering all those overheads at American prices—plus still needing to import raw materials—would make the end product astronomically more expensive, surely.

The point that was not brought up was how does it effect each level of people.  Tariffs are in effect a sales tax on goods, which are regressive in nature.  That means the poor will pay a higher percent of their disposable income for the items which are taxed and the rich a very low percent of their disposable income.

Isn’t that the same reason they increase interest rates so everything cost more money for businesses they can’t buy as many products. Therefore the price of the product goes down. With the higher prices, some demand will go down therefore bringing down the price of the good for them to maintain the demand. It’s impossible for a company to continue to raise the price and pass along the cost without feeling a little bit of the loss of demand.

You didn't consider how tariffs typically boost the dollar's value, which can counteract the purchasing power of a 10% tariff. For instance, a 4% rise in the dollar's value due to the tariff would reduce the effect, resulting in a 6% impact on finished goods and raw materials still imported from outside the US. This is assuming no other mitigating factors are applied either naturally or strategically. For example, after recouping trillions in waste, the tariffs could be balanced out through other govt incentives or creative methods.

Tariffs are not calculated at the end selling price.  They are calculated at the cost of the raw material or item.  That shirt from Bangladesh, that someone paid $10 for, may have cost Target $1.  A 10% tarrif now made that laid-in cost $1.10.  So does Target now eats the 10 cents or raise the price to $10.10?

As far as tariffs when the prices go up people will buy less and hang on to their vacuum a little bit longer slowing the volume of purchasing which will cost the manufacturing countries in the end. We will spend less overall because we're not buying everything we want we're buying less overall because we're still working with the same budget.

I personally don’t like the idea of tariffs. I think it’s trying to solve a problem without attacking the root of the problem (high cost of labor).

Our tax cycle is repetitive.  We're getting taxed on the same money at multiple junctions. 

I'm in favor of eliminating:
Income taxes,
Property taxes, and
Estate taxes.

This would allow people to actually own their property and build wealth.

We would still have point of use taxes.... like sales tax and all the other regulatory fees for this and that.

I'm in favor of shifting to tariffs on all imports to at least 25% and more in some cases.
Instituting a 5% federal sales tax and maybe a sales tax on real estate transactions. 
People who buy a house to keep would pay that tax once.
Then, when they're done paying off their house, they'll truly own it.  They could pass it on to their children, and it would be a generational wealth attribute. 

These changes would actually bring in more income.

Sure, the cost of goods would go up by 25%.  But, the money in your pocket would go up by 25 to 53 %.  Now, you are taxed  when you earn, and when you buy.  In this alternative, you would be taxed only when you buy.  It's much better for everyone.  Those who have more disposable income will buy more and pay more.

Will the host of this video comment on these ideas.

I like how you started off doing a great explanation of how tariffs work. You should’ve stuck with that. Then you veered off in peripheral subjects, not related to tariffs, where your primary message of explaining tariffs was somewhat lost. This should have been two, separate videos.

I'm not from america, but we have american product sold in my country, and it is 2-3 times more expensive than local made, so 25 percent tariff won't make any differences imo, it will definitely cause inflation on american part. American currency are one of the factor too.

Just to clarify, at 5:50 minutes into the video, the increased clothing margin doesn’t kill the US economy. Just walk around anywhere. Most Americans don’t care about their appearance. Look around; you see people everywhere wearing oversized shirts, tights, warmups, basketball shorts, hoodies, and crocks. Americans downgrade themselves to where this is not the norm and acceptable.

Tariffs aren't inflationary. Inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply. Tariffs will cause a one time increase in prices. Consumers will buy less or buy less costly alternatives. And the new higher prices, caused from the tariffs, won't continue to increase. Somehow this is a common mistake lots of YouTubers are making. It's like saying, ""a one time increase in taxes will be inflationary.""

you fail to mention,  Due to market values/Competition ect. The retailer getting the vacuum for 100 will now tell the supplier it need to be closer to 90 due to the market. In the end if suppliers don't lower the cost to retailers there will be far less demand for their product. (I.E - things like paying 180 for a product that last 7 years vs 160 for a product that last 3-5 makes paying 180 a much better bargain) An economy is much more fluid then the rigid tax logic you are implying. So rising cost from suppliers will either have to stop or reverse if they want to sell product.

There's a piece that everybody is missing.... 

If you imposed tariffs and those goods move to the United States... It's not as simple as moving human labor...

The outcome might actually be that it might be human labor in another country but robotic labor in the United States.... If you did that you wouldn't actually have to increase costs over the long term

We need to understand the difference between inflation and rising prices, Inflation is an increase in the money supply (END OF STORY). A rise in prices can happen for a number of reasons including (but not limited to) natural disasters ie Hurricanes, wildfires etc. or an increase in sales taxes can cause prices to rise. This is different than rising prices due to an increase in the money supply.

Same thing with your vacuum cleaner example....

I think we're underestimating how many companies are having things made outside of the United States just because it's easier in the short game than building robotics to automate things in the USA... 

When robotics become efficient there's almost no reason that everything can't move back to the United States...

In fact... The argument could be made that other countries will not be able to produce enough energy to be able to run the robots....

So my assumption is that there is basically zero chance that human labor will ever go as low as robotic labor once you scale it and once it matures.... There's just no way....

Because of that... And because of energy superiority that we will have in the United States... No one would be able to compete with our robotic manufacturing... I think that's the bottom line.... long term...

No, clothing can be made cheaper in North America by fully automated factories, than by cheap human labor in Asia. This is already happening. Similar problems apply to many of your other arguments. A big concern is that the US and Canada don't have the infrastructure needed to manufacture most goods domestically, and this will take a LONG time to build out. Canada is too small to build out their infrastructure in any meaningful way.

Those of you who agreed with the gentleman in video obviously perceived the profundity of his explanation that I didn't. Yes, other countries have a competitive advantage because their laws allow them to pay their workers little to no money. The guy literally admitted that other countries have an advantage because they pollute the planet. America is always blamed for pollution. The tariffs makes is more expensive to buy goods from coutries who can get away with polluting the planet because it makes it more expensive to buy their goods. Doing business in America will be cheaper so buying American made goods from companies who pay their workers a livable would be the better option. The gentlemen in the video gave his explanation as if the tariffs were the only thing in play. Trump's also signed  executive orders that have reevaluated the aid we send to other countries have revealed wasteful spending. I mean we sent funding for a research study on trans monkeys with aids. The withdrawls from WHO and the Paris agree is going to save us Trillions of dollars. Trump also signed an executive order to address the rising cost of rent by by eliminating the coercive climate policies the increase the cost of fool and fuel. When you combine everything together you create more jobs. You lower the cost of goods because more people will have a jobs. That equals more taxes that will be put to good use and not given away to fund a war we have no business funding.

Many of these have supported America during various US led wars (Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan).

How could tariffs affect the United States?

A 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico will raise production costs for U.S. automakers, adding up to $3,000 to the price of some of the roughly sixteen million cars sold in the United States each year. Grocery costs will rise, too, as Mexico is the United States’ biggest source of fresh produce, supplying more than 60 percent of U.S. vegetable imports and nearly half of all fruit and nut imports.

Nearly half of all U.S. imports—more than $1.3 trillion—come from Canada, China, and Mexico. However, analysis by Bloomberg Economics shows that the new tariffs will reduce overall U.S. imports by 15 percent. While the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs could generate around $100 billion per year in extra federal tax revenue, they will also impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and ultimately driving up consumer prices.

Certain sectors of the U.S. economy will be hit particularly hard, including the automotive, energy, and food sectors. Gas prices will surge as much as 50 cents per gallon in the Midwest, as Canada and Mexico supply more than 70 percent [PDF] of crude oil imports to U.S. refineries. Also at risk are cars and other vehicles, as the United States imports nearly half its auto parts from its northern and southern neighbors.

A lot of variables and unpredictableness could come into play. Trump has a lot of good ideas and is a shrewd businessman. Personally, I think he should start by throwing a low ball and then escalate towards the high ball he wants to achieve regarding tariff amounts to see how the economy is doing overall. I think Trump is shooting high on tariff amounts because he knows he might have to compromise with other countries, thereby getting the minimum median amount he secretly wanted from the beginning. I love the idea of no Income Tax.

If we had a 10% tariff on all imports and we import 3.8trillion that’s 38 trillion in income. That funds our government and gives us a huge surplus.
You drop income tax and I’ll happily pay 10-20% more for goods.

Unless we can have competitive domestic prices on goods tariffs do not make sense. However, please don’t forget how many countries rely on American exports as part of their GDP. if president trump does drill and produce cheaper oil for USA consumers and dramatically reduce the price of fuel in addition to altering the income tax system and begin exporting more oil. That’s a lot of moving parts, but I can see America withstanding the brunt of Inflation long enough to see foreign nations invest their business in the USA bc they want our consumers at a lower tax rate.

Fords and Chevy trucks should not be any more than 27-32k seeing these trucks selling for 70-100k is ridiculous, in fact you can get Toyota trucks cheaper often times.

Do you own a car from Canada? Mexico? China?
How about Japan?? Germany?? America?? We as Americans dont buy cars from Canada or Mexico.
Look at your VIN number....
If it starts with a 1. It was made in America.
If it starts with a 2. Canada.
3, Mexico.
J, Japan. W, Germany.  
Cars that start w a 3 or a 2 are mostley American car companies. Just a matter of time until production returns to America, Americans and prices due to things being produced in our country.

Marketing companies have ruined economies, not outsourcing:
While bringing up Nike, this guy conveniently leaves out the fact that Nike is a predator company that will grind a country's workforce to the ground until they start saying they want higher wages. Then, Nike just leaves, to find child labor somewhere else.
And, by this guy's theory of consumers then getting things cheaper, this is a complete lie.  Nike shoes are overpriced by 70%... way overpriced than they're actually worth.  This is primarily because they wear out just like any other rubber souled shoe, and have thin souls... so that you have to buy them again.  Because they sell you shoes that cost under $10 to make, for over $100 dollars, is because they spend billions in marketing to tell you they're better.  You're paying $70 for them to tell you they're great... and they're not.
Nike was the first company that figured Americans are so stupid, they'll pay MORE for a plain T-shit that has their name on it.  They have nothing but contempt for you; you're the mark.  Same goes for Apple.  I wonder if Tim Apple would tell Trump to his face, ""those jobs are never coming back."", like he did, Obama.  Make no mistake, Nike and Apple were pioneers in this crap.  Now, China is making Aircraft Carriers.

The argument you make is more complicated than that. 1. The tariff of 10% would be on the wholesale price which is the smallest cost. Yes, this would increase that cost by a ONE Time 10% increase in product inflation. No inflation the following years. Lets take Nike shoes. If it cost 10 dollars to make a pair of shoes the tariff would be 1.00. If the shoe sells for 100.00 obviously the cost could be absorbed. The worst case scenario is the retail price increases by 1.00 or only 1%!!! 
2. You mentioned only briefly some of the pollution and ethical costs of production. It is unethical to continue to take advantage of millions of people as modern day slaves. No chance to improve their lives or living conditions as they pollute the air, water and land. No dollar value has been put on this.
3. It is the Companies off shoring, importers and retailers who are the slave owners reaping massive profits with no consequences. They can easily swallow the costs in most cases. 
4. The real issue is fair trade. Globalism is the disease.. Surely making products locally should be environmentally better. Supply chains in Country are critical for essentials instead of from profiteering globalists manipulating prices. Product quality ensure longer life and less landfill. This is a world wide issue. Cheap products do not benefit anyone long term. Trade between countries should be for products which cannot be produced locally for products they need. Lifting the standards of all people. We all work for monopoly money anyways. None of it has any value and is manipulated by the 1%ers. This will continue as long as we are complicit beneficiaries. Tariffs are not the problem.

If you tax imports from China, say, wouldn't the tax apply to the Chinese entity bringing the the good into the country? That would force said entity into 2 choices:
1. Increase the price of the good they are trying to sell in America
Or
2. Eat the hit to their profit margin in order to stay competitive in the US market with US domestic manufacturing.

The first would be raise or ""inflate"" the cost of goods, but the second would not AND put Chinese money into the US treasury. 

To say tariffs are simply a consumer tax is a little misleading. Especially if their are tax cuts given making it cheaper to produce goods here AND give the American citizen more money to spend in these goods.

You say a domestic Walmart would have to pay the tax but it seems as though the Chinese exporter is the one who pays. 

Is that incorrect?

Tariffs are a tax but so is money printing which also fuels inflation. Imho, tariffs need to be imposed on countries to gain parity with their export taxes such as tariffs, subsidies, and gaps in regulatory standards (eg. Worker rights and environment). That is only fair to create an even playing field. I also think it is a good tool to punish Mexico for their part in the mass human trafficking invasion and the drug cartels.

We´re kind of mixing apples to oranges. China has a competetive advantage in manufacturing largely due to labor wages and benefits. Just look at how american union salaries and benefits affect the production costs. Add environmental and other federal laws and see how much that cost compared to China. And sure, greedy manufacturers (like auto makers) would likely raise prices because they can. But really, don´t we all want to strive for competing on a level playing field?

If you really think American products will be significantly cheaper, you're mistaken. They may drop in price by a dollar or two, but that doesn't make them affordable. American products will be less expensive relative to the now higher-priced imports.

For example:

If an imported product originally costs $100 and a 10% tariff is added, the price goes up to $110.
If the American-made equivalent was already $105, it is now cheaper than the imported version.
However, $105 is still expensive, just less expensive than the $110 import.

Countries facing Donald Trump’s tariffs should Introduce an EXPORT TAX equal to Trump's tariffs. If Trump has a 25% tariff on goods from Canada on exports to the USA, Canada will have a 25% export tax on goods bought by The USA. If Trump reduces the tariff to 5% or removes it, Canada does the same. The Canadian Government will gain revenue to compensate Canadian sellers for lower sales.

You tried to explain tariffs and its nature for price increases but the problem is the logical contradiction people are experiencing now.  Because tariffs work as any other taxes they increase prices , other taxes also increase prices. But media usually explain that additional tax for corporations won't increase prices but tariffs will increase. So this is logical contradiction which obfuscated everything. By the way Trump also contradicts himself when he speaks about the need to decrease taxes to boost business and at the same time to increase tariffs - which are also taxes. By the way - it is obvious that even Trump doesn't  believe in his words ; that tariffs are payed by foreign countries - if he believed he would made tariffs 1000% higher or more. Why not ??? if it's free money ?

Inflationary. Stupid. The US is at full employment. Tariff is a tax paid for by the consumer. Meanwhile he stops funding health and other benefits to the American public. Now he’s blaming government employees. Has he ever admitted to making a mistake or taking responsibility? Not that I remember. $4Trillion of the deficit is due to his tax cut which expires this year.

So basical the working pore and blue collar people like plumers and tradesman and people and families that make less than 70k a  year already struggling are screwed 7 ways to hell because those oranges strawberrys  and 90 % of the food we buy will inflate 10× worse than now. If you have kids you cant afford strawberries at 10$ a pint as just one example groceries for 4 are already 200$ worth 3 or 4 days food.

The variable of wages need to be considered.. as well of the amount of debt. right now consumers have a choice to buy only USA made products. In the past Trump and Ivanka had a choice to make their products in the USA but decided to do it in China.. talk the talk but can walk the wall

If tariffs are self inflicted wounds to US citizens then why are mexico and canda threating retaliatory tariffs? Why not just let US citizens pay higher prices? The factor you are failing to mention is that we can absorb tariffs especially if it motivates us to produce domestically.. mexico and Canada can not .. we need a more equal trade deal with them ... Hopefully it forces them to the negotiating table before their countries go bankrupt..

You are also neglecting to mention that the tax environment is also important. Granted we can not complete when it comes to labor costs but we can offer a much better tax rate .. many companies would prefer doing business in a tax friendly country that can promise security..

That's why he's reducing taxes, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, drill baby drill, fixing the energy, so you gonna have more money so you can pay $160 or $180 vacuum with no problems. Or maybe the vacuum from the USA is gonna be cheaper. The economy is not only related to tariffs.

Maybe the mistake taht developing nations (like Mexico, Vietnam, India, Senegal, etc.) got trapped, was taht the most profitable market to be more profitable to produce goods for that US consumersnad to forget to produce the goods your market need. Mexico forgot to produce maiza corn in order to sell avocado to the US. Now that that avocado with a new tariff to products of the US firm and govt., avocado will bring less currency of hard dollars. So Trump will have to face the uS consumer will be angry to pay more for a good, ad might vote next election against the Republican Party. And the Mexican Govt., will have to face angry workers out of jobs. The whoe world could see the US as a very bad trade ally, voluble, aggressive and unreliable. Back to the 1960s, when the military govts suppress their angry voters.

No hay fábricas, no hay mano de obra, no hay materia prima, o también es más caro producir localmente que por fuera eso es lo que Trump no entiende se tardan años para producir y ser competitivos no es en unos meses. Al final suponiendo que se logran todas las metas de tendrá que ser competitivo con el otro integrante, pero cuando él otro integrante tiene mejores condiciones naturales de producir lo mismo en mayor cantidad con mejor calidad y con precio competitivo aún que USA impulsa tarifas con impuestos eso no logrará que su mano de obra sea mejor que los países que están acostumbrados a ""sudar"" la camiseta para producir más mejor ya venir precio eso es lo que USA no entiende aparte todos los obstáculos que la reglamentación las normas, los sueldos y que más personas no quieren cueros trabajos. Eso Trump no lo entiende hoy si porque yo trabajé en los 2 países y sé lo que estoy diciendo. Así, que Donald Trump no va a ser USA great again, eso no es magia, es un estilo de vida, costumbre, naturalidad, ambiente, trabajo pero los más importante en Latinoamérica la gente sufre más para lograr lo mismo que el gringo.

Sorry, you lost me when you said that trump is only human, and that nobody is perfect. And although everything else that you’ve said seems correct, you’re wrong to believe that DT Himself, doesn’t believe that he is perfect!

Not quite Bryan. They will raise prices not 10% but 14% to maintain their gross profit margin as a percent of cost. Thats how little Trump cares about us.

Math may not be your thing?  This is probably some of the dumbest crap I have seen on this topic.  You know that Tariffs are on the Import Wholesale value of the product -- not the Final Retail Price of the Product?   You do know this, right?

Trump like tariffs because it encourages companies to not depend on China as much as we are. If you import from Indian it’s a different story. I think you don’t really understand tariffs.

@ClearValue - yeah the labor, raw materials, etc from the outside countries are cheaper, BUT you didn't really mentioned that when it reaches America, the prices are the same as HIGH as the goods sold here. Meaning, the MANUFACTURERS OR THE IMPORTERS are ripping off the consumers. For a NIKE shoes that you put as an example, you didn't mention how much the cost of making one pair of NIKE shoe - your video is non-transparent. Pure speculation. Fake news.

Go back to your mom’s basement and study math. You just mathematically proved Trump is doing the right thing. Wa wa.

"Trump Tariff Update on: Mexico, Canada, China, BRICS: https://youtu.be/z09QnBxnpHo"
This is hands down the best source of unbiased financial news and explanations
I’M AN IMPORTER…I PAY THE TAX and raise my prices to my retail customers who then raises their prices to consumers. It's 100% inflationary
"The worst part is, companies are already talking about increasing prices more than 10%, just like they did in the pandemic. They know we are expecting increasing prices, so they will try to get the maximum they can squeeze from us."
"I think we need another update with the 25% tarrifs on Canada, Mexico and 10% on China."
Unless there is a competitive product in the US then tariffs are just tax for US citizens.
"One thing to add: U.S. companies also use imported raw materials, services, and hardware to produce their products. As the prices of imports increase, it also forces U.S. companies to raise their prices, which are already uncompetitive (Vacum example in the video), to make up for the increased cost of production. Whichever way you spin this initiative, it's going to be inflationary.

Thank you for the unbiased and informative videos!"
Can we all stop to appreciate how straight forward and unbiased this was. Well done sir!!
"The answer is simple, less government = less spending. Less spending = less tariffs and taxes."
"It will still be cheaper to make in China even with 100% tariff. That is how large the cost gap is now. Meanwhile, US consumers will need to pay more without any new jobs created."
Trump’s 2018 tariffs made steel prices explode.  I have literal receipts from my suppliers.
"In my opinion, unless Congress significantly reduces spending (like, cut it in half as a starting point), then talk of tariffs is just another rearrangement of the chairs on the Titanic."
"The scariest thing about this entire debate, is that it shows the world how woefully uneducated the average American adult is. We all assume that our neighbors are operating with a basic understanding of fundamental economic concepts. Yet along comes Trump, proposing an outlandish economic agenda that is severely flawed on face value, and half our nation is so financially ignorant, they can’t even discern policies that are financially ruinous to their livelihood. It’s so demoralizing."
"My main concern is how to survive all of these financial and political crisis, especially in light of the US political power scuffle. The government has really called things more difficult for its citizens, and we can't sit back and bear all the consequences of the bad governance."
With all due respect that doesn’t stop Nike from still charging you $80 for a pair of sweatpants when they’ve only paid $4.25 to make it
"Two things not mentioned: (1) retaliatory tariffs (2) Price competition. If the Toyota in the example goes up in price by 3,000, any American brand that is price competing with the Toyota will raise their prices too, just because they can - its how capitalism works."
"$15.00
Thanks!"
I’m from Vietnam and the government taxes all imported cars heavily which makes them more expensive. Who’s going to pay? Of course the consumers. Only the rich can buy cars here
"We should not tarrif anything that we cannot feasibly produce, like coffee, chocolate, cheap clothing. We should target out tarrifs with a real endgoal or industry in mind."
It's so great seeing how unbiased this channel is. Please keep it up
"I usually look up your videos for updates! Our government has no idea how people are suffering these days. I feel for people with disabilities not getting the help they deserve. Thank you PAP(PAMELA ANN PUNKAR), imagine investing $12,000 and received $305,500."
"In 1994 I worked for Lexus dealer when Terrace were threatened. The owner laid off 25% of his employees, including me. It was very disrupting."
"So it's basically a fancy dressed up way to tax Americans and tricking them into thinking that they're getting taxed less, but in reality, they're getting taxed in a different way.  Thanks for the info as always Brian."
"Tariffs will raise the price of components and completed commodities utilised in US manufacturing. Inflation will rise sharply and immediately as a result. The Fed will have to raise interest rates in order to combat inflation, which will benefit billionaires but may deprive the middle class. Because inflation is so severe, people are actually taking out loans to pay for necessities. Yes, the collapse has started."
"Inflationary? 
Importers: yes 
Consumers of imported products: yes 
Short term: yes
Long term: no 
Long term our economy will nab all profitable opportunities until we reach capacity after which the tariffs will be adjusted or become more targeted."
"Also, to use your example, Walmart won't add $10 to the price, they will add $15 to the price so they can increase their profit margins.  We know this because of how many companies did it after COVID when everyone was using the specter of inflation to price gouge.  You can look at various corporate' profit margins.  It's right there in their financial reports."
"The problem is when domestic manufacturers decide to increase their prices by 10% because they can, and trust me they will"
"In the interview at 1:10, Trump says ""..when companies come in and they dump their products in the US, they should pay automatically let's say a 10% tax.""

This proves that he really believes that the company that sells their product to the US is actually paying that tax. He obviously actually does not understand that this tax is paid by the US importers and, eventually, customers."
This is the only man I trust on youtube when it comes to stuff like this
Small business owner here. Great explanation! Inflation is going to go crazy.
"So in the end, tariffs are just another tax that we have to pay"
"Lets be real here - the companies aren't gonna be paying the tariffs. It'll be the consumer, based off of ""current inflationary pressures."" Sadly, gonna be record breaking profits for all companies again "
Brian doesn’t miss. Analysis was spot on.
"Amazing! All the videos I watched talk about trumps tariffs, but none of them is like this one breakdowns in such clear and simplistic way"
"I was born and grew up in China, and lived there till I graduated college. Now I have been living in the US for nearly 2 decades. I want to share my own experience about those companies who imported from China.
We now are only talking about how the tariff hurts American consumers however I personally never a big fan of Walmart or any of those big import companies because they damaged Chinese people’s life even more.
Some of my relatives are doing exporting business in China and they’ve been doing  it for over three decades. When I was there, in order to keep a low price to sell competitively in the US, all those imported companies came to China, asked the lowest minimum price from all those tiny manufactories. Remember, this was at least two decades ago and tariff was low. 
In order to keep those big companies, all those Chinese manufacturers had to cut down the check amount to all the Chinese laborers, move the regulation bars, asking people to work 24/7 with three shifts. To remind you, those workers didn’t have any 401(k) or good health insurance, and some of them were asked to work part-time only. 
As a result, the environment got more and more polluted, people were still struggling at the surviving level two decades later. 
So instead of arguing whether we should raise the tariff or not, I see this tariff as a changing point - those big important companies needs to change because they are harming both countries, economies, and peoples lives and environments. 
I’m never a big fan of Walmart, and I always paid attention to where the product was made. 
I have personally witnessed how cheap kitchen utensils were made in my relatives factories, I felt so bad for those young laborers who didn’t have any personal protections at work. 
You have to understand that those cheap nail clippers, nail polish, kitchen utensils, kitchen knives, kitchen scissors were not made by any big companies in China — they were made by small factories that did not have any pollution protections or peoples health protections. 
They are now more and more so-called “ cancer villages” in China because of those pollutions. People didn’t know them because they “made the country face look bad.”
So as a result, I see this tariff as a challenge to those big importing companies, because it is definitely time for them to change how they do business in both countries now. It is painful to see how those companies hurting peoples lives in both China and the US. Thus said, I don’t see tariff is a threaten but a chance for both countries to work together for a better world."
Brain saying the “math aint mathing” literally made me bust out laughing 
Man I love this channel. No bs . No bias. Just the raw truth based on definition and data
Crazy how people would riot to protect minimum wage and labor standards in the USA but they're content to have someone work with less or none of those things on the other side of the planet if they can get their stuff cheaper.
"Steve Cohen who was Trump Economist advisor said correctly. He suggested that before imposing tariffs, develop you own internal manufacturing"
10% tariff across the board will INEVITABLY be passed to the consumers fueling the inflation.
We need an update video: as of today 25% on Mexico and Canada. 10% on China.
"Even I knew from watching Ferris Bueller, the scene where the teacher explains that the Tariffs made the great depression WORSE lol"
Thank you for putting this in words that some people need to understand.
"I know I'm a couple weeks late to this.. it just occurred to me that I should probably figure out this whole tariff situation LOL. But I just wanted to say that with the political climate of our country right now, and all the craziness that's going on, the people in the comments are absolutely right. This was probably the most fact-based, unbiased, and actually educational and informational piece of content that I've probably seen in about 3 years. It was just nice to have a break from all the election drama for a  little while lol. Sometimes people don't realize that they tend to come off a little bit patronizing when they're trying to explain something to beginners of the subject. It's not intentional usually,  just the way it comes out. But this was easy to understand while still maintaining an educational feeling of you talking to me and not at me. Not everyone is able to teach this way, it's such a great skill. Great video great information. Thank you."
"So for a country that loves capitalism, you can't get upset when you can't compete with your competitors! Its like calling a foul in sports when you were just loosing. Anyting made in America has to come with a American hourly wage and will cost more! So if your wallet and pride wont take a hit and wont matter to you, this will be just fine."
If we're going back 100 years ago then let's consider how high tariffs in the United States was a driving factor to the Great Depression.
I love the unbiased straightforwardness! Simplified.
This is hands down the best video on tariffs ive seen. Thanks so much for educating people on this issue.
"Great non bias explanation, the best I have found so far. New subscriber "
"It would take longer than 4 or even 8 years for the entire country to restructure itself to accommodate the kind of goods these billion dollar companies would need. It would take years to build the factories, fields, and infrastructure. There's no financial incentive for them to do any of this."
"Tariffs benefit some but hurt far more by decreasing consumer purchasing power, increasing the cost of production for businesses that use imported products and passing that cost to the customers, and hurt domestic consumers due to the lack of competition which tends to push up prices, not to mention how the Chinese tariffs hurt U.S. farmers on soybean exports."
Man I wish everyone would watch this.  Nicely done Brian.
"Make sure you have assets….the economy will tank under Felon Trump! .  Immigrants help drive the economy, including picking most of the food in the US.  Food prices are going to explode."
"when taxes are cut for the rich, someone has to pay ----- all US citizens via tariffs"
"Great video. One additional thing I would add about tariffs and that is it tends to drive the prices up of domestically produced products as well. Let’s say with a tariff the imported goods cost 10 bucks, and the domestic is 9 bucks. All of a sudden the domestic product will sell for 9.99 because of that price gap created by the tariff. Also, product quality tends to go down as companies look for ways to slash costs."
"The thing is EVEN IF made-in-america goods are cheaper than foreign goods. If those foreign goods used to be competitive, it’s ALSO an opportunity for the american goods to RAISE their prices to increase profit. It’s a lose lose all around where everything becomes more inflationary."
VERY GOOD EXPLANATIONS. THANKS
"Tariffs rarely work exactly as intended. And less often than that, they go unretaliated. China will just punish American farmers."
"I often try to find made in the USA when I’m buying tools. It’s actually not that easy. There is store near Buffalo ny that’s made in America store. It’s slightly disappointing. I try now more to support local made things. Pottery, wood products. Some knives and foods. Farmers markets are great."
"I found this video to be a clear and informative overview of the consequences of tariffs; thank you, Brian. However, two points of clarification may help viewers understand this issue in a bit more depth.

At minute 3:50, Brian introduces competitive advantage as an explanation for why trade with partners who produce cheap goods is beneficial to the United States. While this may be true, the strongest argument in favor of free trade encompasses more than merely a benefit to a single country under a specific set of circumstances. Due to the phenomenon which economists call “Comparative Advantage,” it will always be beneficial for all countries to specialize and trade with each other, rather than trying to produce everything for themselves. International trade benefits all countries, regardless of whether or not a given country can produce goods more efficiently than other countries, because even the least-efficient countries must have a lower opportunity cost of producing certain goods compared to other countries. 

At minute , Brian poses the question, “Who pays the tariff?” and proceeds to assert that the consumer necessarily pays. While it is likely true that the consumer ultimately pays in many cases, the technically correct answer is: it depends on the price elasticity of demand of the good in question. The extent to which a company (Walmart in Brian’s example) can raise the price of the good to preserve its profit margin depends on the extent to which consumers are willing and able to pay more for that good.

Given that this video is a summary and not a deep dive into the economics of trade policy, it is understandable that those points were not covered, but hopefully those who wish to gain a deeper understanding will find this to be a helpful starting point for further learning."
You are the man your explanations are excellent and right on
Thank you so much for this video! So many people have no clue what a tariff is
"The government wouldn’t need more money if they weren’t doing shit like paying $150,000 for a single paper towel dispenser for the military."
This is hands down the best source of unbiased financial news and explanations
Very clear and simple enough vid! Great job
"The problem is there are not enough products actually made in America, retailers offer you cheap Chinese crap to buy. WHERE are the American products, and who is offering them? Regarding clothing, so little cotton is being used in our clothing that you can hold your blouses up to the light and actually see through them. Walmart winter clothing will NEVER keep you warm, period!"
"Tariff is just more government intervention. Everything is going to cost more, there is no way around it."
"Tariffs just remove competition from other countries, creating monopolies, making prices much higher and quality lower."
"Brian explains , these so simple and easy to understand , Thxs"
Thank you. Wanted to know if Trumps Tarrifs would work without Fox news or CNN telling me absolutely yes/no
"Very informative, thanks for unbiased information"
Tariffs would slow down Fast Fashion.  That would be another pro.
"Very good an simple explanation, I learned more  on tariffs  now than when I was in school"
This is very well explained to people who don’t understand the tariff.
Trump seems to think other countries are going to sit back and allow the tariffs without imposing tariffs on American imports.
"It gets more complicated once you take into consideration the reaction of other countries. If they impose tarriffs in turn (on US imports), then two things will happen. 1- governments collect more taxes in the form of tarrifs. 2- global trade will decrease because it is more expensive. Looking at the world economy as a whole, it is difficult to see how tarriffs can be beneficial. To me they seem more like a drag on overall trade, just like other taxes."
Trump Missed Economics 101 in the 9th Grade
10:31 exactly. Government should not be this big to begin with
An overlooked problem that contributes to inflation is that our standard of living is going down while the standard of living is skyrocketing in the countries we import from (China for example). This means our wages stagnate or go down while theirs goes through the roof comparatively. That can't be sustained for very long unless we start moving manufacturing back here.
"An important thing to note is the disparity in prices and costs between the exporter and importer. If it was 10% or even 20% cheaper to make products in China and import them to the US then a 10% tariff may genuinely make some companies consider moving operations back to the US. However, in today's economy it's astronomically cheaper to do manufacturing in other counties - fractions of the price! No company is going to move back to the US to dodge a 10% or even 30% tariff. It would still be a worse situation for them. They're simply going to pass that cost along to the consumer. This isn't a debate or philosophical thing, it's basic math. My company manufactures electronic equipment in Taiwan and it would require a 150% tariff to even come close to making it fiscally rational to move ops back to the US."
This is the only unbiased description of tariffs I've seen.
How you haven’t launch some kind of news network is beyond me.  Been following you since COVID. Thank you for everything that you have done. I think you found your true calling. This could get big. 
"I am absolutely pro small government and abolishing income taxes and property taxes on cars, recreational vehicles, and private residences that dont generate income."
"While we talk prices, we have to recognize it’s not just financial. We have to consider the self-sustainability for the US. When we couldn’t import chips from Taiwan, for example, we couldn’t even sell cars. It’s a national security issue"
"Brian, excellent n concise video on the tariff topic "
"The argument on tariffs that is also ignored or simplified is regarding creating US jobs, the idea being that companies will move the factories to the US and it will create more US jobs... but who will work these jobs? Already the labor market is stretched. If you add the deportation policy into the mix it will just become more stretched. It will cause massive inflation."
"A 10% tax on all imports isn't bad if you also reduce income tax simultaneously, the 60% on all chinese imports is another matter."
So basically...buy as much of the stuff you think you may need NOW before the tariffs... start
Masterclass in practice economics with applied basics- Bravo!!
The low cost of regulations over in these countries is NOT a good thing. People die because of it.
Brian always coming through with just facts straight no chaser. Thanks for the video.
Those Kirby vacuums are tanks  mine still works after 20 years.
"OK, but this video as well as like all the other videos on tariffs I've watched today. Doesn't do the thing that I need someone to do for me if tariffs don't work then how do we protect our economy in a way that does work?"
"You explains so well, I’m normally bored by economics but you explain quite well and you stick to the point so I had to subscribe "
"Ah, I am yet two steps ahead of you sir, and I say that government 'should' be massively smaller, shrunk to the size where tarrifs alone (or nearly) can afford to cover the entire budget. The budget is out of control, shrink it to a reasonable size and we can then have a discussion about the need for additional taxes, if any."
"Excellent videos. He explains complicated subjects such as taxes and tariffs  in a simple, easy to understand way."
"I'm in the clothing industry and made in USA doesnt mean anything. They can slap that on if they use imported materials to sew in the US. Materials can be woven/knit, dyed, treated, printed outside of the country."
"You forgot to mention that while the government can charge 10% on everything imported, it can't tell or force companies not to raise prices by 10%, and you know they will raise it by 15 or 20%."
Brian - you did it again. You explained that beautifully for the masses. 
Oh boy can't wait to read these comments tomorrow
Thank you! You explained how Tariffs will effect our economy as well as the countries involved.
The only real answer is to reduce the size of government. It may be painful at first.But absolutely worth it long term!Our Federal  and local governments are way larger than they should have ever been.
"Amazing video, A friend of mine referred me to a financial adviser sometime ago and we got talking about investment and money. I started investing with $120k and in the first 2 months , my portfolio was  reading $274,800. Crazy right!, I decided to reinvest my profit and gets more interesting. For over a year we have been working together making consistent profit just bought my second home 2 weeks ago and care for my family."
"A tariff is merely another tax on consumers.

The rich are STILL not going to be taxed."
"Your videos are incredibly helpful thanks to the simple examples you use, thank you!"
"I remember when Walmart had commercials showing that all their items were American made and Union made! The jeans were for a long time, I remember the tags clearly. It would be nice if we could go back to that. I worked long enough for Walmart to take off, but they obviously got greedy in their profits and therefore abandoned for cheap foreign made inventory which also enabled them to really explode their profits and grow more."
"Retail markups will include the tariff as part of the product cost:

$100 vacuum x 1.5 (50%markup) =$150

$110 vacuum x 1.5 (50% markup) =$165"
Nothing makes in the US is cheaper even after you added the 10% of tariff to the import products.  On the flip side other countries will impose tariff on the US export products too.  When China stopped buying US farm products Trump spent $49 billions dollars on US farmers.
"It is absolutely a tax on the middle class and poor.  We shop at Walmart.  Hence, in reality, we pay the $500B in collected tax."
"Very well explained. Thanks, man. Simple and easy to follow. Why can't regular media do this? Good work!"
"I just don't understand the point of ""cheap goods"" if no one can buy anything because we have no jobs."
"No biggie. They could make it 20%, they don’t care. Cost will just get passed on to the consumer as always."
Very well explained in detail. Thank You for input on both sides.
"You can apply this exact same logic on increasing the taxes on Corporations. The consumer always pays. Whether its taxes, tariffs, sanctions, etc. It's always the consumer. So the question is not if tariffs are inflationary. The question is are they more inflationary than raising corporate taxes?"
"Back in 2010, the average tariff China imposed on US goods was 8.09%. Some of our products were tariffed at a whopping 3,000%. So it wasn't like Trump suddenly imposed tariffs on the innocent Chinese government. He was simply evening the playing field a bit."
"none of these videos mention if the US imposes a tariff on the world. the world will impose retaliatory tariffs on us goods, forcing business to leave the us and relocate."
Thanks for the explanation its on point.
Whoever thinks that the country sending the products and the company importing the products will pay that increase out of their own profits is not very bright. The only trickle down we have is increased costs.
No one ever went broke under estimating the intelligence of the American consumer.
"My best advice, if you need anything expensive buy today.. if you have a house and a backyard create a mini garden."
"I didn't know the Tariffs concept but you have shed the light. Good job,,from Kenya East Africa"
"You didn't mention at all, that other countries retailiate with tarrifs of their own.   China imposed tarrifs on US Motorcycles (e.g. Harley) and other goods,
which makes us made good less competitive abroad.   For example, the US exports massive amounts of wheat.  Farmers can be devastated if tarrifs are put on wheat."
"Trump's policies had been viewed by many experts as more positive for various sectors, spurring this massive rally. It's enticing to consider purchasing some stocks despite the ATH, I'm contemplating investing more than $300k. Thoughts?"
"""Trump is only human.  Nobody is perfect.""  That's the best laugh I've had all week!  Great video."
"Today, Nike shoes are primarily manufactured in Vietnam, China, and Indonesia. While its design and development remain in the United States, the company sources materials from around the world and employs thousands of workers in its various factories."
The Math ain't Mathin. Love it!
to all gamers Playstation 6 going to be expensive
This guy is talking about slave labor and saying it’s because it’s easier lmao
I just want to say this was clear and easy to understand this entire thing great content..I just hope the American people can benefit from this when it's all said and done
Tariffs works both ways. Many countries have huge tariffs on American made products. We charge nothing or almost nothing. Not fair.
"How many here are curious about people who always talk about ""I will buy made in the USA,"" how much $$$ do they make in a month, after tax?  Are they rich and don't even give a shit about how average people live or are they just talk the talk?"
"Don't forget retaliation by other countries.

Remember Trump 2018 taxes on steel and aluminum from EU countries.
EU targeted a few products from USA - one specifically was Harley Davidson. 
Importers of Harley Davidson motorbikes had to pay a 25% tariff - Harley Davidson lost important market, decided to start production in Thailand for avoiding those tariffs. In addition production costs in Thailand are much lower than in USA. 

Also on 2018 Trump tariffs on China - China stopped buying soybean from USA, replaced USA by other countries in Latin America for soybean and even more products. Total losses for USA are much higher than the expected tariffs. 
Additional option: China stopping deliveries to USA for a few products they have an almost worldwide monopoly, such as some of the rare earth metals."
"Levelheaded and informative as always, thank you for your work."
Tariffs don’t work.   It they are great if you want to pass on risk and price to the American people through inflation
The right sized tariffs won’t be inflationary. Companies still need to be price competitive. This issue isn’t as simple as explained.
"So basically, the price of living is going to go up even further, and frivolous spending will stop for most Americans."
A very very good explanation.. cheers for that 
Remember when the British monarch put tariffs on imports and WE the liberal people of America responded with the Boston tea party?
"By Trump statement, he absolutely knows that US consumers pay tariffs. He literally said it will make us a lot of money. And based on how we answer the question, he is not planning on having to provide relief to you as consumers. He absolutely sees it as a way to tax US consumers an additional 10%."
"Your prediction didn't stand the test of time. He's already placed a non targeted tariff on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico."
"Excellent video
Definitely needed one on the subject"
Wish every voter in America could have seen this before voting
I’m starting to wonder how much of my savings will actually go to taxes. I don’t want to end up losing a huge chunk of my nest egg to the IRS.
"I love that you're unbiased. I'm just sad seeing that your suscribers aren't. Just a bunch of saying this and that, thinking they know enough."
I love this channel! 
It’s unbelievable how many people don’t know basic shit.
I am here for your take.
"In order to compete with these foreign businesses, we would need to innovate and use a technological advantage to outperform even the lowest paid foreign worker. We would then need to cut a lot of the unnecessary regulations imposed on us. Not the regulations that stops us from poisoning our water supply or products, but definitely the regulations that are intentionally anti-competitive and pushed by the corporate lobbyists. 

The issue is that we've given up on innovation and instead rely on unethical cheap labor. If we can innovate to make production both cheap and ethical, that would be the best of both worlds."
"Great informational video about tax, and tariffs for people who claps and don’t  understand how tax and tariffs work"
American products prices can't compete with other foreign countries products prices.. labor cost alone cost a fortune in u.s than in china
"“Nobody’s perfect.”

Trump thinks he is."
The whole reason why we fell into the Great Depression is because of tariffs History loves repeating itself
Thank you for this
So entrepreneurs like me who have been slowly building infrastructure in the US are about to win BIGGGGG!
You haven't really tackled the effect on American exports. Foreign countries will tax US products as retaliation.
I think the cons outweigh the pros
Thank you for the clear explanation!
Remember dear americans: you wanted this 
" MAGA! 
Yes you guys voted for this!"
"Awsome video  love how you cover all your claims. We need more media like yours, to save this country. 🇺🇸"
The thing not talked about is the huge trade imbalance. America imports more than it exports.  Retaliation by foreign countries by adding taxes on things Americans want!    Now the orice of everything goes up.   Why is no one talking about this.   Americans don't understand other countries can also place tariffs on us too!
Isnt 10% Tariffs on imports just translates to 10% purchase tax on your own citizens?
Why does trump say it’s a massive amount of money and then two seconds say it’s not that much money?
You cannot blanket tarrif...we don't have the raw materials to make everything in america...we just dont.
I never knew how Tariffs worked. Thanks!
Taxes are good now? I can't keep up.
The  problem is  we pay for the  tariff not  other  countries
Hello Brian! Can you list news sources for me ? I want to learn more. Thank you!
"Your stuff is top-notch, man"
America is an import economy. This would cause rapid inflation.
"I believe you misrepresent the way Walmart sets the price in that example. It is not set to maintain an arbitrary certain gross margin of $50. Instead companies set prices at exactly the highest prices that customers will tolerate without changing goods. Walmart does not necessarily pass the 10 to the consumer instead Walmart must slowly inflate prices at the normal rate of inflation which is not set by supply and demand and is instead largely changed by the profit sentiment. A  $25 dollar swing on importing a product is unlikely to be immediately passed on. It gets baked into the overarching inflation rate which is not rationally set. 

There is no argument about gross contribution margin when raising current prices. Toyota raises its compact car prices because it can, because it sees consumers will cough up another 12k not because of tax and carry fees it’s entirely a game of spending psychology. 

I double down that a tariff is not immediately born by the consumer. The consumer already endures the highest price tolerable irrelevant to the underlying fundamentals of the businesses"
Majority of Americans think the meaning tariffs is free lunch economics (China will pay the bill) because they got their education at Trump university.
Great explanation 
Also Trump is trying lower taxes. Which would affect the federal budget deficit all over the USA. Extremely damaging to disabled people and retirees!
I remember I used to buy very affordable New Balance shoes made in the US not 10 years ago. It wouldn't be the end of the world to bring shoe making back to the US or at the very least to Mexico which would maybe help strengthen Mexico and reduce the migrant crisis and make them less dependent on narco money
When Walmart prices go up. The poor people from the red states is gonna be upset. ️
This breakdown is very detailed and understandable.  Great job.. Thank you.
"This is a good breakdown, but I think we should also consider if this will be inflationary on goods made in the US. As someone who has worked for a parts supplier for an auto manufacturing plant I would encourage everyone to google what the inside of one looks like. Notice the robotics that move these cars down assembly lines. Ask yourself where those robotics are made. (It’s not the US)

The cost of production here in the US will also go up with a 10% tariff across the board. That will then also be passed on to the consumer. It also makes it more expensive to build new manufacturing plants in the US and keep them running. Company’s will keep the cheap labor and pass the cost on to consumers because it’s still going to be more cost effective than building entirely new manufacturing here. 

Targeted well thought out tariffs have had good results. 10% across the board does nothing but start trade wars and creates inflation. 

If only we had a successful recent example of how to create manufacturing jobs in the us to model policy on. Like, hmmm, I don’t know… THE CHIPS ACT PASSED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. It used TARGETED tariffs AND government incentives to build simi conductor plants in the us."
For the record .. They build Toyotas in South Carolina  and BMW/Mercedes in Alabama ... so there's that.  Just so ya'll know.
"In reality, with the other Trump deregulation and making energy less expensive, tariffs are not going to make consumer prices higher for imports. Energy is over 15% of the cost of products.  Reducing energy prices by 50% of today's price for fossil fuels lowers the cost of production, transportation, warehouses, and distribution centers to the retailer.  Each level reduces their energy cost by 50% and lowers the retailer cost at wholesale prices.  Also, lowering income taxes puts more of their enings into their pockets. Deregulation creates incentives to increase productivity.  So, just addressing tariffs is not the full picture."
"Love watching your trading videos. You're one of the noticably more informative people on YouTube, instead of being a charalatan like most."
Great stuff Brian.  Thanks for putting this video together!
The stupid one is trump
Nobody is going to pay like $60 for a tee shirt made in the USA when they can buy it for $14.99
"My first instinct is you don't understand the strategic, dealmaking, and arbitrage onshoring aspects of this."
"I always look up your videos for update! Our government has no idea how people are suffering these days. I feel for people with disabilities not getting the help they deserve. Thank you Mr Humphrey Yang, imagine investing $1000 and receiving $5,700."
My man
Great job on slides and over video and narratives
First ?
This is a great video. Thanks for making it
Thank for explaining this to people i hope everyone could see this
Clearly explained.  Thanks.  Subscribed.
"the manufacturer passes costs on to the wholesaler.....
the wholesaler passes costs on to the retailer.....
the retailer passes costs on to the consumer....."
You’re wrong. It doesn’t work that way.
Yah it's the most beautiful word because it raises taxes.
Thanks for explaining this so well good sir.
This guy is the goat of explaining things
"Thank you for your explanation, very good"
You gave me so much to think about. Thank you for your explanations.
tariffs can be used for negotiation tactics
"Tariffs on Mexico will cause grocery prices in Texas to Go up by 10 %, because many produce items Imported from Mexico to Texas Grocery Stores Including Walmart."
"In my opinion, 10% tariffs on all imports can cause more harm than good when it comes to consumer purchases and for the American economy."
Now that was a good video!
"very good  educational,   in basic terms to understand all the pros and cons , very important to know all the facts."
Great video! Thank you!
You know the old adage that those that don't understand history are bound to repeat it
You forgot 2 major contributing factors to your cost/benefit analysis. #1 D.O.G.E. #2 tariffs as a negotiating tool for other countries to unlock their economy to the US. So that we are allowed to sell US products in other countries that are not currently allowing us to.
Please do a video about the difference between how tariffs get calculated and get passed to an end user verses how VAT gets calculated and passed to an end user?
"This is excellent,thank you"
Well done video.  Thank you
"the impact on foreign producers importing to the US is indirect. consumer feels the price increase first, the producer feels the decrease in sales second, effectively a decrease in demand proportional to the tariff."
"it is also worth raising the issue of the reaction of the country subject to tariffs. If Japan is punished with a 10% tariff on Toyota, it can impose a 10% tariff ie
 on Tesla."
Great explanation and content
Imported goods will go up with tax and imports so therefore it defeat the whole purpose of getting rid of income tax comprehend
This is the best explanation for my brain
"American countries that cant make goods here, but can make them better and cheaper for us overseas shouldn't  be taxed! Countries that make their own goods to sell to us, need taxed, esoecially if they tax our goods!  Fair trade and fair prices!  Some countries depend on us to buy their goods to survive and each need to be evaluated!"
100-150 years ago were the worst time for the middle class in American history 
Oh well prices go up that’s life. Just live the best life you can despite all these distractions. I’m broke but me and my family are extremely happy. Always Grateful
Fire explanation man
Good job brother 
Domestic producers just increase their prices to match the difference of the tariff imposed on foreign goods.
"If there’s no income tax, because tariffs replace that revenue, Clear Tax will be out of business. Bias video."
Thank you!!
"Except when he places tariffs on foods and raw materials, such as softwood lumber, steel, aluminum, and minerals such as nickle. So, using his 25% tariff that he intends to impose on Canada, building construction, infrastructure projects, and fruit and produce will cause consumers to dig deeper."
all clear. thanx. but at the end all that taxing n savings......all that will b spent on vvars n b0m6s
I appreciate your neutral overview on this topic. Great video.
"If im a seller to the US, you add my cost (via tariff), i'll add it on my price. Bottomline, Americans will pay for higher price products. Period."
Great explanation
"The problem with companies ""just building a factory in the US"" rubbish is that they're not free*, and they take a lot of resources of various kinds to build - and they take a lotof time to complete.
*That means companies are going to have to borrow money and just servicing that loan is going to be expensibve, and that WILL be added to the retail price!"
Excellent analysis
Wow! Toyota Camry!
It’ll never get better for Americans on these tariffs as they have a higher labour rate so the costs will never go down in America
Excited to see the next few years
Thank you for the confirmation about how imported cars are gonna cost more.
Thing is Nike makes a sweatshirt for $2 in Taiwan and sells it for $120 in America.  I’m sure they can swallow the tariff for us!!
This channel is definitely unbiased and i love that. One thing you left out though in conjuction with the tariffs trump are imposing he is also trying to cut government spending as well to make the tariffs more effective. I don't know about you but i can respect some body that said one thing and does research and changes accordingly trump might have called Bitcoin a scam in the past but now he see it as the future.
Well it’s January 31 2025 and Trump is imposing a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico and I think that is FKD up . Other countries including US are going to suffer by inflation. I’m so sick of orange  Trump 
He found the word groceries the other day. This man is unstoppable in the new word game !
To remain in business foreign companies may also absorb a good portion of the the tariff  to remain competitive among other imports. In your example of the vacuum at $10 each a  company may reduce their price by $5.
Breaking news : Foreign countries raising prices to cover tariff 
"Making the effort to learn about tariffs. Thanks for the unbias reporting and sharing with us the pros and cons. I guess as a evaluation, we should roll back on tax on all imports and make it less expanded."
When all these tariffs work ! I’ll be back to comment again
Cool thank you for explaining tariff
"Good point on tariffs, pls continue and make sure you explain the macro picture with more conservative speakers on your platform. You will grow your audience by truth ."
"Competitive Advantage is an overstated scam, Bangladesh labour is $1/hr, US is $15 an hour but transporting the good across land and oceans will cost you say a few hours an hour and the profit goes to the US company charging as much for the goods as if they were made in the US. Basically the savings does not get to the consumer, it shows as profit to the company."
"very informative video! the most sensible approach without backtracking would be to impose tariffs on the three countries mentioned while having competitive products still being imported from another country. I'm hoping there is already a backdoor deal in place to shift the need for Chinese products to another more friendly country. in the short term, I don't see how consumers won't be hit with a price increase but it could possibly help in the long run."
"The answer is to reduce the size of the federal government. 
D.O.G.E. has entered the chat.
Now Tarrifs are here so we shall see."
"I like the example about the vacuum cleaners. 

In my opinion, it’s about longevity. That Kirby vacuum is likely to last much longer than the cheap Chinese vacuum due to a higher standard of quality control.

So if the Kirby vacuum last five years before breaking while the Chinese vacuum breaks after one year, you’ll end up spending more money over time by having to replace the Chinese vacuum annually.

Lastly, this contributes to our “throwaway mentality”. You’re likely to simply throw away and replace a $150 vacuum rather than a $500 vacuum. The $500 Kirby vacuum based on the picture appears to be constructed using higher quality materials, such as metal instead of plastic. That alone makes this item more recyclable."
"this is quite interesting! thank you!  Yes, it does make sense if Trump put tariff on products that has competitive advantage when produce in USA. As a matter of fact, why not all countries do that too.  Promoting more job oppurtunities is not a bad thing at all."
Brian your my champion !
"I remember in the 80's with Chrysler going out of business, Imports went through the roof, but I thought to myself ""At least we make our own home appliances, pickup trucks and industrial trucks. Today we don't make ANYTHING. Samsung took over the appliance market, Japan took over the industrial truck market and an American car is a bunch of parts imported from other places. This country is not the same as it used to be. In reflection things were great in the 1980's and we thought it was bad."
Absolutely I agree. Get rid of IRS. Let me spend 100% of my money how I choose. Put Tarrifs I decide how I want use the money that will be collected in sale taxes (not income tax) or how much of my income I choose to spend every month. If I choose to be tight with my money it should be my choice not the government restricting my income by taxing me through income tax.
"The price of an American made car just went up $3000 to $5000
 Thanks Diaper Don."
"Usually  i do not comment , but really really good job mate on presentation ."
Trump's favorite word in the dictionary is BANKRUPTCY 
Thank you.
One main thing missing from this interpretation is the fact that there is a global market competing for business in the US.  It's not as simple as 10% tariff equals 10% more to consumer.  This opinion is missing a lot of other context.  But I know it's fun to think we understand the global economy better.  There are many many gears that contribute to economics.
The clothing example does not take into account productivity (automation) which is much higher in the USA.
The Kirby vacuum is a cheaper investment over time. When a $500 vacuum lasts 25 years or more it's pennies a day to own. You'll go through more than five $160 vacuums in 25 years.
Would be better to say that the more expensive American products would appear to be cheaper.
But the issue is local traders just raises the local price to just below the tariffed goods.
"Tariffs can be a good thing if they not only stimulate local production but find more efficient ways. Like if US manages to mechanize all factory processes ,it will be an industrial powerhouse."
"Great, simple, concise video… great content. 
So will give more money to our already incompetent government !!! Sounds like an extra tax for the people. As someone else mentioned if there were competitive product made in the USA increasing tariff might help, but the main reason foreign good are brought by American companies is because most of the foreign products are significantly cheaper."
Toyota factories are mostly automated. There is not much in job number gains for us workers
"I work in international logistics, the cost it takes to bring a container here and the fees associated with the container in america are really high. the corporation will not lose that much money if they made clothing here especially if they used machines instead of child labor."
Great video.  Maths ain't Mathing was excellent 
"Yes, but something you are leaving out is that we will not have income tax. Also, it has always been illegal for the IRS to collect such a tax from us."
There are hoovers for $70 dollars on walmart right now. So I'd argue that there are probably many more comparable American made vacuums that could compete if we had tariffs.
Awesome video
It depends if Walmart will increase their price which they will I think.
Trump thrives on MAGA lack of understanding how basic of economics
You mentioned open stock account is free why need brokerage account like Edward none investor company and etc please explain .thanks
"So instead of importing the complete goods, he’s forcing a situation where, IF companies then have to pivot and develop domestic production of the same goods, they then need to import all the minerals and resources to build the infrastructure for said production, before even beginning the work that then would turn a profit. Not to mention then paying higher overheads e.g. wages. Ok, so all those jobs will increase the employment rate, at least in the development phase, but covering all those overheads at American prices—plus still needing to import raw materials—would make the end product astronomically more expensive, surely."
"The point that was not brought up was how does it effect each level of people.  Tariffs are in effect a sales tax on goods, which are regressive in nature.  That means the poor will pay a higher percent of their disposable income for the items which are taxed and the rich a very low percent of their disposable income."
"I manage a Dollar Tree and really wonder how this will affect us. Price increases, less products, etc.."
"Excellent video.  You know your economics and accounting, and Trump will use all kinds of feints and parrys  as part of negotiating!"
When you’re figuring how much the United States collects does that include Terrace that are already in place are you subtracting that out of the total?
"We must bring jobs back to the US. 

Make it happen."
It is not competitive advantage. It is comparative advantage.
Consumers will pay the tariffs
"the company's profit is %. paid $100 and sold at $130. with tax, the new price paid is $110 and sold for $143. with the same profit of 30%. without forgetting the purchase tax. Example of 6% tax. 130/137.80$ and 143/151.58$. The 10% becomes 11%"
Nice explanation
only thing we can do is wait and see... the hell these Trumpers unleashed on us all
If income taxes for the people are removed will those who prepare taxes e.g. H&R Block will they make less money?
This is the part I don't get if Walmart is importing the vacuums to continue with your Walmart example why is Walmart paying the initial tariff and not the manufacturer who made the vacuums?
He lied. His favorite word is greed.
"Hi quick question on your explanation.
Why is Walmart having to pay the 10% tax? I thought he meant the tax will be paid by the foreign country."
Great explanation Sir.  Thank you.  New subscriber here.
Excellent explanation on tariffs
But Walmart would also add mark-up on the 10.00 so it would even be higher
"Also, the foreign countries could retaliate and impose tariffs for USA products. If the american tariff will be imposed to all products, does it mean also to oil from the Middle Eastern countries? I can't imagine inflation on fuel in the USA...."
the cost of things will go up even though they are sourcing it for similar costs too...
"We will need both tariffs and income taxes until the debts paid off and we cut all wasteful, corrupted spending."
"The biggest flaw behind this video is the idea that American-sourced goods would stay the same price. I'm truly optimistic about this. Currently, America is going farther in debt every year, inflation is rising, and prices are rising. I don't know why anyone thinks our current state is sustainable for the next 20 years."
Inflation is not a general price increase in the economy. inflation is a monetary phenomenon. inflation causes price to go up but prices going up does not cause inflation.
We should have 1000% tariffs from the whole world. That way we will get everything for free and USA will be soo rich.
In order to prevent inflation from tariffs we also need to break up the monopolies like Walmart who can just increases prices on a whim like in your example because they don’t have competition
"To name a few programs that we have today; Social programs that we have today, Social Security Benefits (SSDI, SSA Survivor Benefits, SSA Burial Benefits, SSI, etc.) VA Benefits (Medical, Burial, GI Bill, Loans, Veterans Compensation Benefits, Vocational Rehabilitation, Pension, Death Surviving Insurance and etc.  Section 8 and other housing programs funded by the Federal Government.  At the state level SNAP benefits, health insurance programs are often subsidized by the federal government as well as nonprofit organizations etc.  All of which did not exist 100 years ago."
It will produce more inflation according to your explanation. Thank you.
A Kirby is $3000 
"Increasing consumer prices causes people to buy less and better maintain the products they have already purchased. That is a good thing as people have become too addicted to ""throw away"" purchases. Recall when qualitt shoes could be repaired instead of thrown away and a plastic version bought for replacement? Try visiting a Thrift store for clothing instead of buying new, etc."
As a Canadian. It sucks. Only good thing is our energy sector will be saved in the long run due to this
"sounds like a great way for Trump to create more division in the wealth gap in America, but hey, why would he do that? It's not like he would benefit from a wider wealth gap lol"
"Re the cost of vacuum cleaners: US production could increase substantially if tariffs were introduced and that could lead to greater efficiencies in manufacturing and supply and distribution, thereby decreasing the price to the consumer due to increased supply and demand."
How can someone say something so obviously false “the foreign country pays the tariff” and get away with it?
Very clear
"I know for a fact that Toyota's manufacturing in the US has many many Japanese people ""imported"" to manufacturing roles.. not all, but at least 30%."
This ages well. You has been underestimate the stupidity of Trump
lol that crypto back tracking is wild lol. Same with TikTok 
I think it's a good thing. Things may be more expensive but increasing values here may change wealth gotta wait and see who knows
How much tariffs have other country’s charged on our goods ?
"Gotta remember, tariffs can pay for most if not all gov't functions, thereby lowering taxes normally or even canceling out income tax outright which is a spending gain across the board of at least 30%. more expenditure in the retail space means eventual lower prices because of big buy discounts that can then compete with imported cheap stuff, think people think"
Then the state sales taxes are imposed on the tariffs…enjoy your new Trump prices folks
Trumps a lier
"My question is, can the big greedy corporations work with the government? By taking the 140.00 for the vacuum. And not passing the burden on to the consumer?
If that can't happen, it won't work."
"If things cost more for the consumer due to tariffs, consumers stop buying, and we end up in a depression."
"Isn’t that the same reason they increase interest rates so everything cost more money for businesses they can’t buy as many products. Therefore the price of the product goes down. With the higher prices, some demand will go down therefore bringing down the price of the good for them to maintain the demand. It’s impossible for a company to continue to raise the price and pass along the cost without feeling a little bit of the loss of demand."
"According to all these people, a tariff is a tax on a foreign concrete yes, but the price gets passed to the consumers, which would be US citizens.
Everything goes up."
I can see manufacturer jobs coming back to the state if and only if we implement robotic manufacturing
"Yes, Toyota builds (I have owned two) their pick ups in Texas and Mexico instead of Japanese like before, but the backdrop in 2025 is different than in 2016 when Trump first came to office. Inflation was historically low from 2010-2020. I think this time around the tariff could have been put on the back burner"
In your example you suggest the importer will pay the tax.  This is true.  But Walmart will go back to the supplier and put pressure to reduce the buying cost.   Without a doubt the importer will not own the tariffs alone.
"No bs, straight forward content."
he only said it to win support lo.
"You didn't consider how tariffs typically boost the dollar's value, which can counteract the purchasing power of a 10% tariff. For instance, a 4% rise in the dollar's value due to the tariff would reduce the effect, resulting in a 6% impact on finished goods and raw materials still imported from outside the US. This is assuming no other mitigating factors are applied either naturally or strategically. For example, after recouping trillions in waste, the tariffs could be balanced out through other govt incentives or creative methods."
"cut off electricity to the US East coast, cut off oil to the Midwest, cut off Natural Gas, cut off Potash, and we can keep going Trump. From the USA to the new USSR "
"Tariffs are not calculated at the end selling price.  They are calculated at the cost of the raw material or item.  That shirt from Bangladesh, that someone paid $10 for, may have cost Target $1.  A 10% tarrif now made that laid-in cost $1.10.  So does Target now eats the 10 cents or raise the price to $10.10?"
"Basically, all import goods must tax at least 10%."
Tariffs will come with a price to the consumers. I can't wait to hear all the complaints coming.
1700$ for Kirby G5 Vacuum bought in 1999 still works. Has a shampooer they still fix them.
There’s no way Wal-Mart or any USA corporation will take a hit on their corporate profits. The tariff will make the cost of the product higher and the CONSUMER pays more. That’s inflationary. 
"You just answered the question,,,, Government has gotten way way way WAY too BIG!"
It all is based on negotiations. The art of the deal. It’s like negotiating a car just give him time.  You never have negotiate a deal so just wait .
What would happen if you put a100%tarif on the stocks investors buy?
"Tariff will cause prices to increase, and we all know that once prices increase, it  will never come down again."
"If tariffs imposed by President Trump primarily harm Americans, wouldn't retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico similarly harm Canadians and Mexicans?"
Dyson is made in China and its over $500 ️
"The US consumer is the thin part of all, and who paid for it. The Chinese still make it cheaper and increase the production, in scales according to the world market they're going to provide. They don't lose, they will produce more. While here trying to fulfill the demand of the market, and they reached the point of equilibrium."
"Great video. That's how I like the news, no bias."
Inflation inflating 🫢
Thank you
Why are the Experts not giving him this information are they Just Scared of Trump
"in Oz the aged and dying drink brown bag booze because of its price point
do the calcs, $15 for a pint of tasteless fizz or 5 ltrs of boxed Goon?"
"From your example, I think it would be the foreign country that would pay for the privilege of importing goods into Walmart. (Not Walmart paying the importing fee because that wouldn't make sense.)"
 this video didn’t age well!!!you might want to rethink your plans
"The point is TO reduce the size of the federal government.  When the money isn't coming in, they can shut down everything that's no longer essential and return power back to the states."
"You're missing a point. 
Trump intends to reduce 1. red tape 2. internal taxation"
Have you not seen the prices of Dyson vacuums? They are not made in the U.S.
I am skeptical but it seems that it could do some good
We use to be number one in exports.
"This is a long series of bad takes. Tariffs only work if we produce in the US, and no one has explained where this new manufacturing labor force is going to come from... we're a service economy with historically low unemployment, currently engaged in deporting our entire migrant labor workforce. Even if we can find workers, we have a much higher standard of living than most of the rest of the world, and I don't think anyone is ready to pay $5000 for what is today a $1000 refrigerator. 

Also, this didn't age well. The tariffs are not targeted, they're across the board."
"No... Walmart will increase the price by a factor based on the cost price.
They make 50% on the original price of $100 making the end user price of $165...
Based on the cost price of $110, the end user price will go up to $165.00 this maintaining the profit margin of 50%....!"
How is this any different from the EU VAT tax?
I hate that when I search “trumps tariffs explained” it just shows news videos making it hard to find unbiased videos like this.
One point that wasn’t 100% accurate. Walmart doesn’t pass the tariff along dollar for dollar without markup. They add the tariff to the product cost then add their regular markup.
Brilliant !
Could we make the business pay the tariff and not pass it on to the consumers? In other words they are paid from the margin of the exporter and not the importer.
"Good video, but I think you miss the point of tax reductions. If the imposed tariffs  are conter-balanced by tax reductions for ordinary Americans, there would not be inflation caused by the  tariffs. It must be well dosed."
"4:17 you use a static situation- the amount of sun shine in 2 different areas,  to compare with a totally dynamic situation - the economy structure , to get your conclusion?"
As far as tariffs when the prices go up people will buy less and hang on to their vacuum a little bit longer slowing the volume of purchasing which will cost the manufacturing countries in the end. We will spend less overall because we're not buying everything we want we're buying less overall because we're still working with the same budget. It will cost these companies and make them be more fair with their tariffs against us
You only can put more tariff the product cost samilar
"I still love the idea of tariffs because even if it gets passed on to consumers then it becomes a step in the direction of a consumption tax which I am for. The only people who pay income tax are adult citizens with jobs. With a consumption tax, every person who buys anything pays a tax for example, illegal immigrants, teenagers, people who don’t have jobs and live off the welfare state etc"
I personally don’t like the idea of tariffs. I think it’s trying to solve a problem without attacking the root of the problem (high cost of labor). I think a better solution would be to eliminate minimum wage laws across the board and reduce regulation and red tape on businesses. This would promote innovation and growth in our economy.
"If groceries keep going up, I will apply for Gov food assistance.  If I can't get it, I try the Food Banks.  If that fails, I guess I will be homeless just to buy food.  Many like me are already on the edge.  This is insanity."
There are many other elements that are not being accounted for.bits explains a tarrif pretty well. But the truth is tarrifs and sales tax coupled with a limited government is the only way.
"Perfect!
Canada can reorganize their business and trades to EU instead.
Welcome to Europe Canada! 🇸🇪"
"If he gets rid of federal tax, I'd be ok with paying more for products."
Maybe the American producer can make a less expensive vacuum
"You're not explaining this fully, these big corporations such as, Nike and Walmart will absolutely negotiate lower prices so that the tariff will be balanced."
Clothing manufacturers are now using machines that can create many garments with little to no labor costs. That’s one industry that might actually be returning to the US.
Maybe you should update your “opinion” section!
"Our tax cycle is repetitive.  We're getting taxed on the same money at multiple junctions. 

I'm in favor of eliminating:
Income taxes,
Property taxes, and
Estate taxes.

This would allow people to actually own their property and build wealth.

We would still have point of use taxes.... like sales tax and all the other regulatory fees for this and that.

I'm in favor of shifting to tariffs on all imports to at least 25% and more in some cases.
Instituting a 5% federal sales tax and maybe a sales tax on real estate transactions. 
People who buy a house to keep would pay that tax once.
Then, when they're done paying off their house, they'll truly own it.  They could pass it on to their children, and it would be a generational wealth attribute. 

These changes would actually bring in more income.

Sure, the cost of goods would go up by 25%.  But, the money in your pocket would go up by 25 to 53 %.  Now, you are taxed  when you earn, and when you buy.  In this alternative, you would be taxed only when you buy.  It's much better for everyone.  Those who have more disposable income will buy more and pay more.

Will the host of this video comment on these ideas.

Thanks"
Every tax or tariff is finally paid by us the consumer one way or the other. End of it. The INFLATION never ending circle.
"Americans want high quality $20 jeans from Walmart. Oh, and also sustainably made. And also, made in THE USA OF COURSE. And they refuse to wear same pair for years.

Something will have to go, people."
"And if you have an American company competing with an importer of products, they suddenly don’t have to be as competitive, and will increase their prices simply because then can. The consumer still pays more!"
It’s crazy how cool everyone is with paying workers and unlivable wage if it means they save a few dollars.
"When companies like Ford complain about tarrifs, u know we are at the end of reason."
Does this idiot realize that the price of MAGA hats will increase!
"Im rootin for him. So far its obvious that nobody thinks hes fuckin around, he will impose tarriffs, he aint bluffin. People so far have been giving in to some impressive demands."
Well if the cost shifting of tariffs results in lets say another signicant tax reduction then its a wash or maybe an economic plus to US citizens
"It’s actually refreshing and I wouldn’t call it “back tracking” 

Could he admit that he was misinformed and made a new decision based on new information? Sure. But most politicians just double down. I’d rather see 180s with no hey sorry I was wrong than double down and push head on into the lies to save face and appear infallible and without mistake."
"One thjng youdont mention, the wages of the US worker very high with shorter working hours"

"People have new realization. Rhe question is are they remorseful of their actions. I think here people view change because they see where money goes. 

I feel same for this channel.."
Why is Walmart paying the Tariff in your example ?
"I like how you started off doing a great explanation of how tariffs work. You should’ve stuck with that. Then you veered off in peripheral subjects, not related to tariffs, where your primary message of explaining tariffs was somewhat lost. This should have been two, separate videos."
"Don the con has ""favorite"" words like a little kid has a favorite blanket."
Employers will likely not increase wages this time like the did recently.  The people will be hit harder with any more inflation.
"I'm not from america, but we have american product sold in my country, and it is 2-3 times more expensive than local made, so 25 percent tariff won't make any differences imo, it will definitely cause inflation on american part. American currency are one of the factor too."
"Just to clarify, at 5:50 minutes into the video, the increased clothing margin doesn’t kill the US economy. Just walk around anywhere. Most Americans don’t care about their appearance. Look around; you see people everywhere wearing oversized shirts, tights, warmups, basketball shorts, hoodies, and crocks. Americans downgrade themselves to where this is not the norm and acceptable."
"Tariffs aren't inflationary. Inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply. Tariffs will cause a one time increase in prices. Consumers will buy less or buy less costly alternatives. And the new higher prices, caused from the tariffs, won't continue to increase. Somehow this is a common mistake lots of YouTubers are making. It's like saying, ""a one time increase in taxes will be inflationary."""
"you fail to mention,  Due to market values/Competition ect. The retailer getting the vacuum for 100 will now tell the supplier it need to be closer to 90 due to the market. In the end if suppliers don't lower the cost to retailers there will be far less demand for their product. (I.E - things like paying 180 for a product that last 7 years vs 160 for a product that last 3-5 makes paying 180 a much better bargain) An economy is much more fluid then the rigid tax logic you are implying. So rising cost from suppliers will either have to stop or reverse if they want to sell product."
"It amazes me that after eight years, you people still don’t understand Trump."
"And that is the problem. When is everyone going to realize that if you buy cheap you buy often if you buy good quality made in the US you will only buy one for a bunch of years, it’s common sense"
"Countries are NOT dumping their products in US, American business buy from overseas.."
TARIFFS ON PASANGERS AT THE AEROPORTS  18 %   TARIFFS ON TOILETRIES  LIKE TOILET PAPER  TARIFFS  ON WAPENS 
"There's a piece that everybody is missing.... 

If you imposed tariffs and those goods move to the United States... It's not as simple as moving human labor...

The outcome might actually be that it might be human labor in another country but robotic labor in the United States.... If you did that you wouldn't actually have to increase costs over the long term"
Hopefully this will stop some of the over consumption going on.
We bought a Kirby Vacuum over a decade ago. The sales pitch was on point and later we found out the product is pure garbage and inconvenient. We had to throw it away. No thank you.
Toyota Camry made outside of US 30k same Toyota Camry made INSIDE OF US with local labor cost and LAZY work force - 75k
But haven't the foreign car manufacturers all have factories in the USA for decades????
How about all of those parts that go into that Toyota aren’t manufactured in America?  Stupidity and confidence are hell of a combination.
"Canada just imposed 25% tariff on all US goods.  It just sounds that US did the same to Canada, except 10% on oil and gas they need most"
"Get ready for things to be the cheapest ever in 100 years and we will all be rich with zero income tax. Everything will be paid by foreign countries.

"The Solar Generation example Brian uses for Competitive Advantage is a poor choice, that would be an example of Absolute Advantage such as growing Bananas in Central America rather than in Alaska"
You said it…How big is the government? The federal government need to be reduced…That is the answer not taxes…
"This all depends on priority. The reason we ABSOLUTELY NEED U.S. manufacturing is national security. Even for clothing, but especially for electronics and goods for making metal objects. Tariffs will be painful, and to deny it will make things more expensive is nonsense. Regardless, the U.S. must bring back manufacturing. It is a national emergency."
not if you need to wait 2yrs for a permit to instal solar in California
"We need to understand the difference between inflation and rising prices, Inflation is an increase in the money supply (END OF STORY). A rise in prices can happen for a number of reasons including (but not limited to) natural disasters ie Hurricanes, wildfires etc. or an increase in sales taxes can cause prices to rise. This is different than rising prices due to an increase in the money supply."
"Cheaper overseas = BIGGER PROFITS for companies. - Maybe , just maybe ,, a little LESS profit for companies"
"Same thing with your vacuum cleaner example....

I think we're underestimating how many companies are having things made outside of the United States just because it's easier in the short game than building robotics to automate things in the USA... 

When robotics become efficient there's almost no reason that everything can't move back to the United States...

In fact... The argument could be made that other countries will not be able to produce enough energy to be able to run the robots....

So my assumption is that there is basically zero chance that human labor will ever go as low as robotic labor once you scale it and once it matures.... There's just no way....

Because of that... And because of energy superiority that we will have in the United States... No one would be able to compete with our robotic manufacturing... I think that's the bottom line.... long term..."
so there should be no manufacturing jobs in US since using foreign labor is cheaper and unregulated. It is actually surprising how much stuff in Walmart is made in US
I bet Trump underwear are made in China if he wear one
You missed the part about the need to seriously cut Government and spending.
I’m fine with the costs of goods going up so the consumer pays their share. It’s much more fair then the current tax system where your penalized for working harder and those that don’t reap benefits
"That way Americans are taxed when they purchase, you therefore control your taxation

10% tarrif on all imports will increase prices by 10%... average income tax in US is about 15%....

Americans still gain 5%"
"No, clothing can be made cheaper in North America by fully automated factories, than by cheap human labor in Asia. This is already happening. Similar problems apply to many of your other arguments. A big concern is that the US and Canada don't have the infrastructure needed to manufacture most goods domestically, and this will take a LONG time to build out. Canada is too small to build out their infrastructure in any meaningful way."
The other country’s are paying the tariffs not us.they have to pay it before bringing products in.
It is annoying that it is so difficult to find  USA made products. You got to search but it just feels better to buy USA made products.
"A vast majority of electronic passive components ( capacitors , resistors , connectors ) are manufactured in China . A majority of the better quality brands ( US or EU ) of these electronic devices no longer manufacture their own products . There are thousands of electronic component manufacturers and sub contractors in China that make a quality product. This means the country of origin is not in the US, and the 10% tariffs have already started . I have the invoices to show this."
Historically tariffs haven’t been inflationary. Some have but mostly they haven’t. It’s very dependent on elasticity. To say tariffs are inflationary as a general statement is ludicrous.
"Our federal government has to reduce their spending and increase their productivity.  Tariffs are simply one of many financial levers that can impact that the financial wellness of America.  We need to let this play out a little to see if it might work. One thing for sure, Trump does listen to the American people and big companies also listen to him and are for some strange reason are getting inline.  We’ll see, I am not going to abandon the strategy before things are enacted."
11:50 that aged like fine wine. He indeed did not increase tariffs by ONLY 10%
This video did not age well…
The company's have to reduce the price of their products to  match tariffs to sell in the US that way cost not pass on to the public
"Only one thing i would add. Walmart would jack up american made items, along with foreign made. It's double slap in the face."
maybe tariffs on selected  products not all imported  products.
"Does California have competitive advantage? The clear answer is no. Not because of amount of sunlight but availability of sun-farmable land. That is, how many solar collectors can you put on El Capitan?"
Yes
"Tariffs have lots of side affects that you fail to adress. The fact that it will keep more money in America that will turnover and produce more tax and wealth. The fact that job creation will also increase income, purchasing and tax paying."
FYI American companies dump chemicals also
"OK, so why does Walmart for an example need to have to make $50? Why are they so greedy? That’s the problem this is where people don’t understand. It’s these companies who are greedy and passing these tariffs onto us as consumers when they don’t really need to they don’t really need to make $50. They can make $40. It’s a big circle jerk."
"tariff are always a double edge sword, could go very well or very wrong."
"From an ecological point of view, Tarifs could have positive effects on the economy"
Most foreign cars are built here in the Good Old USA
"If I were a foreign manufacturer I'd just increase selling prices by the same amount of tax so the tax is burden is placed on the consumer. Completely negating the ""money making"" that he thinks will happen."
We pay taxes in our checks. We pay taxes to buy food / toys/ all cars/ water/. I think the weight of me paying for something that made in America out weighs having to pay taxes for everything .
"My question for you Brian, Did Biden actually forgive any student loan debt or did his congress block it? If so how much? Also who eats or pays the debt if forgiven. Thanks in advance."
Some is good it’s other way try see if works
i.e. Trump is smoking weed and we get the kool aid
"I do not need new clothes.  I have enough clothes to wear for the next 10 to 20 years.  I do not need to buy a new car. I can drive my old car for the next 10 to 20 years if I maintain well.  However, I am concerned about agricultural products and groceries; fresh fruits, eggs, avocados, etc.  People have to eat.  How about coffee?  Would the price of coffee go up?  That is something I cannot avoid."
At least the US Govt will surely generate 10% instead of none. If the 400B collection from tariff will be spent to the needs of people it will certainly translate into pros.
Raise tariffs if other countries have a problem with it
American company that imports will pay the tariff not the exporters.
Other counties stop shipping to the US.  Now US big business needs to find other supplies which they don't have.  Now the business needs to cut production.  That means layoffs. Personal Bankruptcies will be on the rise.  Jobs evaporate.
The narrator spoke in terms of Trump issuing a 10% tariff on goods while it's turned out to be 25%.  I'm worried he has gone TOO HIGH in his tariff charges.
It's more like Walmart paid 25 dollars and sold it for 150
It's all good because I don't shop at Target.
If you are going to make it more expensive to companies then offer tax breaks or incentives not to pass it off to the consumer. He knows we the people will pay it
i read about the tarrif on South Korean washing machines created thousand of local jobs at a cost of $600K per new job vacancy. Might as well give thousand of people free homes with a requirement that they have to spend more of their available income back into the economy 
I do still think the tariffs are worth it. If youre only looking at tariffs you miss the bigger picture. Especially because trump is trying to decrease government spending and trying to create more jobs and revenue sources. I can see an overall plan here of him trying to create compounding revenue into the country to better stabilize us. Boy will it hurt in the short term. These things take years to see the full affects as positive. This video was definitely enlightening about aspects of tariffs
Dubai has no income tax and they’re thriving… End income tax we get taxed enough..
So are his cabinet Yes men going to profit?
"Congress should make minimum wage, should have no ability for insider trading (including immediate family members), should have term limits (should not be becoming millionaires). Fed Res Powell talks about helping The People, but its not us, it's the government he's helping. They're all in it to give the government more and more."
cant be any worse that the hell we went through the last 4 years.
"To EVERY U.S. importer: Band together and ""Just Don't Pay"" any tariff, new or old, ever again. There is safety in numbers."
"Revert outsourcing over 40 years , Woof! More inflation do the math"
When Trump did the tarrifs on Washing Machines in his first presidency the domestic washing machines still rose in price because they had less competition
They need raise minimum wage to at least 17- 19 hour to the whole U.S
You didn't add competition from other product providers in your equation
"The Hoover vacuum cleaner will last 2x longer, thus resulting in a lower lifetime cost!!!!"
"Why would a company make products in the most sue happy country in the world, when they can export those problems like pollution laws labor laws work comp laws ect. We want those laws here,but don’t want to pay for them."
"American Government will always choose profit over the American people! For example, we make Ford, GM, and Dodge right here in America. Those SUVs and cars are  equal or even higher than their foreign competitors! See for yourself!"
"So if they’re polluting everything, how is that beneficial to anybody as we spend billions of dollars in this country to clean up the waterways?"
"Good information, but “passing” the tariffs sounded like Trump had to go through Congress. Obviously, this was not the case."
the nations who gets americans goods should also charge higher tarifs to american imports
"I dont like saying the American product is cheaper. This is a tool to make american products price competitive at the prices they are already at, tarriffs dont really change or lower the price of American items. The word cheaper kindof feels like the american item would drop in price."
I always thought that solar energy is better in Alaska
Fun watching this after the fact
it's like just protecting your economy.
"There are other countries other than china, canada and mexico. Whatever products we import from those 3 countries, we can import on other countries instead."
Then all that extra money they make due to the outcome of these strategies goes right back overseas to other countries
I don't mind to pay a little bit more as long as it can reduce USA debts. 
No worries overtime is going to be tax free then youll paymore on your income tax
Should lower % in our tax bracket to match the tariff. 12% single x amount should drop if not the whole 10% over half. 7%-8% so we can choose how to spend our money and not continue to allow the government to abuse it. Also rid the extra tax on working overtime. I'm sick of being a slave for our government
"Those of you who agreed with the gentleman in video obviously perceived the profundity of his explanation that I didn't. Yes, other countries have a competitive advantage because their laws allow them to pay their workers little to no money. The guy literally admitted that other countries have an advantage because they pollute the planet. America is always blamed for pollution. The tariffs makes is more expensive to buy goods from coutries who can get away with polluting the planet because it makes it more expensive to buy their goods. Doing business in America will be cheaper so buying American made goods from companies who pay their workers a livable would be the better option. The gentlemen in the video gave his explanation as if the tariffs were the only thing in play. Trump's also signed  executive orders that have reevaluated the aid we send to other countries have revealed wasteful spending. I mean we sent funding for a research study on trans monkeys with aids. The withdrawls from WHO and the Paris agree is going to save us Trillions of dollars. Trump also signed an executive order to address the rising cost of rent by by eliminating the coercive climate policies the increase the cost of fool and fuel. When you combine everything together you create more jobs. You lower the cost of goods because more people will have a jobs. That equals more taxes that will be put to good use and not given away to fund a war we have no business funding."
"It's a shame the 'other side of the coin' wasn't discussed (probably due to trying to keep it brief and meet the needs of those that have shorter attention spans). Other countries will almost certainly use counter measures and this will likely start costly trade wars. Even close allies and long term good friends will be affected. Many of these have supported America during various US led wars (Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan). Using the tough guy 'Big Stick' approach sounds great but discussions with America's friendly nations should be preferred."
Parmigiano Reggiano made in New York?
"The  tariffs that old trumpy  has slapped on various goods simply means that American consumers have to pay the extra , so just a backdoor tax increase really."
"How could tariffs affect the United States?

A 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico will raise production costs for U.S. automakers, adding up to $3,000 to the price of some of the roughly sixteen million cars sold in the United States each year. Grocery costs will rise, too, as Mexico is the United States’ biggest source of fresh produce, supplying more than 60 percent of U.S. vegetable imports and nearly half of all fruit and nut imports.

Nearly half of all U.S. imports—more than $1.3 trillion—come from Canada, China, and Mexico. However, analysis by Bloomberg Economics shows that the new tariffs will reduce overall U.S. imports by 15 percent. While the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs could generate around $100 billion per year in extra federal tax revenue, they will also impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and ultimately driving up consumer prices.

Certain sectors of the U.S. economy will be hit particularly hard, including the automotive, energy, and food sectors. Gas prices will surge as much as 50 cents per gallon in the Midwest, as Canada and Mexico supply more than 70 percent [PDF] of crude oil imports to U.S. refineries. Also at risk are cars and other vehicles, as the United States imports nearly half its auto parts from its northern and southern neighbors."
Are SALARIES going up ?
"Tariffs are going to be used selectively depending on the industry. The 25% - 50% tariff is just a negotiation tactic…it will be much lower. If you want to sell your used car for 15 grand , you have to ask 19 for it. You can’t start at 14 thousand and get 15. Nobody wants to “feel” like they paid too much. Capiche ?"
You ask how much the government has grown but aren't bringing up the announced plan to eradicate unnecessary government/federal jobs
"In the end, the US consumers eat the bill just like we always do."
At least Canada’s produce won’t have any competition. In calif all the produce and fruit is rotting in the fields or trees because the pickers are afraid to show up because of the ICE raids.
"the only one who benefits is the government, not the people."
I don't like that jerzees went out of Walmart they fit the best for me i love those wish they would come back
"Another optic on tariff is that is to protect unproductive industries. US manufacture cars are made at a higher price that Japanese et Corean one and are way more reliable, that why American's buy them. So don't tell American car manufacturers to be more efficient, just impose tariffs and the problem is solve. But is-it ?"
This is a false equivalency when comparing a Kirby to a cheap Chinese vacuum. Who pays depends on the elasticity of price. It is very likely that the tariffs are more used as political leverage than they are used to actually raise significant tax revenues.
So companies are just going to pass the tax on to us as consumers
"The real questionis is, will tariffs replace taxes on the working class??"
"right now ,I  am  not able to eat

6 eggs a  day on carnivore diet "
"NO INCOME TAX ,NO IRS"
Don’t get rid of DOGE then. Cut down dumb government spending and then maybe tariffs will make more sense
Basically If tariffs are increase Americans citizens are the ones ended up paying the US national debts. Although the Americans will suffer but in few years time  this will reduce the debts and save the Dollar/ making Dollar stronger.
"Kirby's are like 2k, Brian"
The bottomline is the consumer pay...
How much would it cost a pair of Nike sneakers made in the USA? ;) or your Iphones? anybody?
This is getting china mexico in canada to the table right now instead of six months from now. Is he's a very smart business man. Who wants to get this Done today. Not three years from now.
Now factor in corruption. Let’s talk about these people in government becoming millionaires tariffs or no tariffs.
I definitely benefited from Trumps tax cuts. The only people I heard complain about it were people that didn't work  at that time lol
The governmnet does NOT need more money. Wild to believe that.
"You know these companies have been charging prices that are so extreme. It says if it was made in America, anyway I understand looking at the stock market only way they rises if they keep ripping people off and taking advantage of their workers further and further, but you can’t squeeze blood out of a turnip, and when people will stop buying a vast majority of these products still have no choice, but to either pay more Create more jobs or charge Charge much less for their product in the short run this is bad for the consumer, but in the long run, it’s going to force businesses to drop their prices. Otherwise they will go out of business."
Kirby vacuum cleaners are bulletproof machines
The tariffs are to pay down our country's debt. Not to grow our government
Corrupt people? He just described himself as one of the corrupt people.
"Interpretation : not Walmart !!Foreign country is paying the tax or tariff when it enters the country! that is before it goes to Walmart !!!
Walmart will try to sell the higher price foreign goods !!!"
Still pretty narrow look at the whole equation...
"My plan is to not consume other than food and gas, travel less, eat less to the tune of 25% less."
Offset the increase of cost with decreased taxes and I’ll be happy.
We should remove income tax to force the shrinking of government.
"Well... 25% on everything from Canada and Mexico and 10% on everything from China. And threatening to go for the EU as well... I am pretty sure this will be quite painful to the people of the USA while all other countries instead while increase trades with countries not imposing tariffs. In the end this will hurt the world ecnomy, but the Americans will be the ones suffering..."
"I think a better policy would be to give tax cuts to businesses who make and manufacturer any products and/or profits in the usa, and to punish anyone who creates jobs/goods/and services from overseas (somehow, tarriffs could be a method, or something else). This not only incentives ""made in usa"" products, but also punishes any companies who attempt to profit off of foriegn labor and/or products."
The answer is reduce goverment overreach and spending. Too easy.
"A lot of variables and unpredictableness could come into play. Trump has a lot of good ideas and is a shrewd businessman. Personally, I think he should start by throwing a low ball and then escalate towards the high ball he wants to achieve regarding tariff amounts to see how the economy is doing overall. I think Trump is shooting high on tariff amounts because he knows he might have to compromise with other countries, thereby getting the minimum median amount he secretly wanted from the beginning. I love the idea of no Income Tax."
As always citizens will get squeezed.while all the price goes up and the income still the same
"However, most individuals do not seem to care about this. They have expressed their preference for Trump due to his record of most deportations as he has said."
Tariffs have been around for years I think they have to keep income tax 
"Tarrifs means less demand , china will slash the price of goods to be cheaper to keep supply out constant"
It really didnt say all countries... right now it just say Mexico China and Canada and maybe this is just for now if us gets a better deal it maybe less tariff 5%
But if americans by american then  foreign countrys can't sell it here unless they drop the price right ? Gouging will just let them sit on products they can't sell at all. A little something is better than alot of nothing.
"If we had a 10% tariff on all imports and we import 3.8trillion that’s 38 trillion in income. That funds our government and gives us a huge surplus.
You drop income tax and I’ll happily pay 10-20% more for goods."
"The problem with economics is , everyone is greedy, the more they have the more they want !"
"We the Consumers will pay the high prices, stay tuned they are coming soon."
"Unfortunately, we have 36 trillion dollars in national debt as of Jan. 31, 2025 . Who is going to pay it?  US citizens of course. It will be painful and most of us will be impacted. Wish you all good fortune in days to come."
"I just hope this tariff encourages companies to move their production to other countries, impacting china."
Time Will Tell
"Its almost as if your saying that the only way tarrifs would work is if we reduced the size of the government to levels when tariffs did work, hmmmm I wonder if there is some kind of plan to reduce the size of Government, maybe D.O.G.E. could help with this dilema..?"
"Unless we can have competitive domestic prices on goods tariffs do not make sense. However, please don’t forget how many countries rely on American exports as part of their GDP. if president trump does drill and produce cheaper oil for USA consumers and dramatically reduce the price of fuel in addition to altering the income tax system and begin exporting more oil. That’s a lot of moving parts, but I can see America withstanding the brunt of Inflation long enough to see foreign nations invest their business in the USA bc they want our consumers at a lower tax rate.

Fords and Chevy trucks should not be any more than 27-32k seeing these trucks selling for 70-100k is ridiculous, in fact you can get Toyota trucks cheaper often times."
He  changed his tone on crypto because elon educated him more on the subject
"So, that 3k taxed on Toyota, they will have to eat that 3k if they want to compete with American cars PRICES. If not Americans will buy cars from other countries. Canada and mexico dont have car companies.  They have American car companies that use cheap labor.
Do you own a car from Canada? Mexico? China?
How about Japan?? Germany?? America?? We as Americans dont buy cars from Canada or Mexico.
Look at your VIN number....
If it starts with a 1. It was made in America.
If it starts with a 2. Canada.
3, Mexico.
J, Japan. W, Germany.  
Cars that start w a 3 or a 2 are mostley American car companies. Just a matter of time until production returns to America, Americans and prices due to things being produced in our country."
This didn’t age well considering he’s rolling out 25% tear of Mexico in Canada starting tomorrow
"sry but walmart will not add $10($160) to the price, but $30 ($190) because they can, then they make a special sell and sell it to you for just $175 great deal!!!1

that how it works"
Only corrupt people don't like tariff ??? Has he been to Brazil. The love that. The corrupt government makes millions.
This is great for Tesla which is made in America
"Toyota still has to import the parts to make their car in Amerikkka, which are tartiffed. Soooo"
The solution is no income tax instead just a tax when you buy goods and terrifs. Or just lower the income tax plus terrifs that way everyone wins
"If Canada spends the surplus buying from America rather then else where. Problem solved, right."
"More bad than good? Can't know without seeing the whole package.
Also (at this time 2 months after the video) efforts to radically slash the government may actually work."
Government needs more money for wars. Our tax money doesn't seem enough to waste around. When taxing is going to stop?? We have crappy US products and don't allow others to be cheaper because it would be some how unfair. Unfair to who?? We are paying for the high prices already
"The part where he talks about how there's low regulation in other countries to make clothing and how those folks get paid .87 cents and hour.. wow..we should all be up in arms about that...if we really want to takle pollution i think we just got a good start,, thamk you Trump"
"Commerce is competition
If the price is high then no one would buy your product and your competitors will jump on the opportunity.
Tariffs are the best way to stop the wilderness of those companies that make cheap product with cheap labor and import it to your count at very high price."
"Minute 6:30: ""There's  a reason why we prefer buy from India: it´s cheaper, we pay less"".....but how about the words said 10 seconds before: ""India has less regulations, pollution is not a problem""....therefore corporations like GAP, GUESS et-all can make more money on the expense of India's People (who cares if its cheaper!!) and on the expense of the environment!!!! How hypocrite can one be???!!!"
"6:07 I don't think you realize how bad you made a sound using this example.. 

I think most of us are cool with fixing this issue, after all that's one of the reasons why he's won"
"I'm kinda confused. So the US doing 25% tariff. Supposedly affects us because it charges the
The corporations or companies like an example Walmart or others like Target?
Or small companies? So why is Canada doing a tariff of  25%? Should  Canada just leave it like that? Because that will affect them too. An tell the U.S your hurting yourself. Don't get me wrong. But Something is missing here. They're not tell use. mean this goes both ways right?if they put tariffs on each other?
."
"This makes no sense. Even when you understand it, it makes no sense. The tariff should be paid by the exporting country. Or, make your product here."
"I tarifa was a great idea
But now me have doubts"
"The tariffs are on China, Mexico and Canada.That means the rest of the world could start putting more product in american hands. It's that simple."
Ummm...time for the update.
Bought Kirby lasted for 10 years.
And Canada retaliated with 25% tarrif back
"TARIFFS ARE A TAX !!
PAID BY RECEIVER / IMPORTER
THE EXPORTER PAYS ZERO
Keep in mind 90 percent of the products sold at Walmart could not be manufactured in the U.S. without the retail cost rising drastically !...."
"Canada 25% ,Mexico 25% and 10% for China, why 10%? Maybe because most Teslas are made there!"
JENIUS.. no one will make any business on the U.S.
Sad this guy was wrong. 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico start 3\1 10% on China too.
There will be no need to pass on the tarrif cost to American consumers because because under the trump administration American  businesses will benefit significantly from the largest tax cuts in American history from 21% to 15%
"Marketing companies have ruined economies, not outsourcing:
While bringing up Nike, this guy conveniently leaves out the fact that Nike is a predator company that will grind a country's workforce to the ground until they start saying they want higher wages. Then, Nike just leaves, to find child labor somewhere else.
And, by this guy's theory of consumers then getting things cheaper, this is a complete lie.  Nike shoes are overpriced by 70%... way overpriced than they're actually worth.  This is primarily because they wear out just like any other rubber souled shoe, and have thin souls... so that you have to buy them again.  Because they sell you shoes that cost under $10 to make, for over $100 dollars, is because they spend billions in marketing to tell you they're better.  You're paying $70 for them to tell you they're great... and they're not.
Nike was the first company that figured Americans are so stupid, they'll pay MORE for a plain T-shit that has their name on it.  They have nothing but contempt for you; you're the mark.  Same goes for Apple.  I wonder if Tim Apple would tell Trump to his face, ""those jobs are never coming back."", like he did, Obama.  Make no mistake, Nike and Apple were pioneers in this crap.  Now, China is making Aircraft Carriers."
"As a Canadian relative just so correctly stated to me, with friends like the United States, who needs an enemy."
Is the Art Vandelay?
"The question is, which country can domestically revamp its manufacturing quickly to close the gaps on imported goods into the country?"
"The argument you make is more complicated than that. 1. The tariff of 10% would be on the wholesale price which is the smallest cost. Yes, this would increase that cost by a ONE Time 10% increase in product inflation. No inflation the following years. Lets take Nike shoes. If it cost 10 dollars to make a pair of shoes the tariff would be 1.00. If the shoe sells for 100.00 obviously the cost could be absorbed. The worst case scenario is the retail price increases by 1.00 or only 1%!!! 
2. You mentioned only briefly some of the pollution and ethical costs of production. It is unethical to continue to take advantage of millions of people as modern day slaves. No chance to improve their lives or living conditions as they pollute the air, water and land. No dollar value has been put on this.
3. It is the Companies off shoring, importers and retailers who are the slave owners reaping massive profits with no consequences. They can easily swallow the costs in most cases. 
4. The real issue is fair trade. Globalism is the disease.. Surely making products locally should be environmentally better. Supply chains in Country are critical for essentials instead of from profiteering globalists manipulating prices. Product quality ensure longer life and less landfill. This is a world wide issue. Cheap products do not benefit anyone long term. Trade between countries should be for products which cannot be produced locally for products they need. Lifting the standards of all people. We all work for monopoly money anyways. None of it has any value and is manipulated by the 1%ers. This will continue as long as we are complicit beneficiaries. Tariffs are not the problem."
"just curious, how many of you guys voted trump and are now learning about tarrifs"
"If you tax imports from China, say, wouldn't the tax apply to the Chinese entity bringing the the good into the country? That would force said entity into 2 choices:
1. Increase the price of the good they are trying to sell in America
Or
2. Eat the hit to their profit margin in order to stay competitive in the US market with US domestic manufacturing.

The first would be raise or ""inflate"" the cost of goods, but the second would not AND put Chinese money into the US treasury. 

To say tariffs are simply a consumer tax is a little misleading. Especially if their are tax cuts given making it cheaper to produce goods here AND give the American citizen more money to spend in these goods.

You say a domestic Walmart would have to pay the tax but it seems as though the Chinese exporter is the one who pays. 

Is that incorrect?"
"Tariffs are a tax but so is money printing which also fuels inflation. Imho, tariffs need to be imposed on countries to gain parity with their export taxes such as tariffs, subsidies, and gaps in regulatory standards (eg. Worker rights and environment). That is only fair to create an even playing field. I also think it is a good tool to punish Mexico for their part in the mass human trafficking invasion and the drug cartels."
They're good IMO
"We´re kind of mixing apples to oranges. China has a competetive advantage in manufacturing largely due to labor wages and benefits. Just look at how american union salaries and benefits affect the production costs. Add environmental and other federal laws and see how much that cost compared to China. And sure, greedy manufacturers (like auto makers) would likely raise prices because they can. But really, don´t we all want to strive for competing on a level playing field?"
"He is now talking about a 25% tarrif, not 10%."
"I think this has to be required general education for pro-tariff and so-called economic ""experts."""
Who suffered the most? Citizen and residents of the US! Not the millionaire nor billionaire of the US. The normal people! All the tax will ended up to the end consumer. Good luck voting for him. 
Kirby Vacuums are more like $2000 dollars!!!!
Get your facts right in 2019 . When trump wanted to buy greenland from denmark. Denmark called this a absurd remark and the child trump called Mette nasty
"I'm Canadian. Instead of you media idiots & politicians whine about how tariffs will ruin Canada, let's figure out how to move forward without reliance on the US. Maximize sourcing food from Canadian owned business's. Maximize interprovincial trade. Increase trade with the E.U. Source fruits & vegetables from South America via cargo ships up Atlantic ocean. Source electronics directly with Asia...Get over it and stop whining!!! Trump thinks like a businessman first."
Canada might want to start building up that military  to protect. Themselves
Did he overspeak her? yes...Did answer her questions? No...Did he lie?  Yes....If Americans cannot see through this problem. it's on you
"If americans think that trump is going to pass on the extra tax to the betterment of americans, then you're dreaming."
Words... LoL... Tariff took over from Groceries...
Yeah but we are going to shrink the size of the government. Why do you think Elon is there he’s gonna lay off after the government workers and close down a ton of departments that are wasteful spending.
"It is all about restructuring supply chain, and letting those big countries buy more from USA. I can’t believe you forgot about the basics"
its the same policy been done at China and India…
"If you really think American products will be significantly cheaper, you're mistaken. They may drop in price by a dollar or two, but that doesn't make them affordable. American products will be less expensive relative to the now higher-priced imports.

For example:

If an imported product originally costs $100 and a 10% tariff is added, the price goes up to $110.
If the American-made equivalent was already $105, it is now cheaper than the imported version.
However, $105 is still expensive, just less expensive than the $110 import."
"Countries facing Donald Trump’s tariffs should Introduce an EXPORT TAX equal to Trump's tariffs. If Trump has a 25% tariff on goods from Canada on exports to the USA, Canada will have a 25% export tax on goods bought by The USA. If Trump reduces the tariff to 5% or removes it, Canada does the same. The Canadian Government will gain revenue to compensate Canadian sellers for lower sales."
"Tariff.However, believe it or not it's the great word ! "
China didn’t raise their prices during the first Trump administration. They paid the tariff because they wanted to remain competitive.
10% tarrif is now in play. It was approved.
"Just for the stupid, if I deliver to the USA for 100 million and the USA only delivers for 1 million and the USA takes customs duties for 100 million, who is the loser?"
Thx! America needs to hear this! Tariffs go into Trump clan’s pocket … taxes benefit the country.
"When people choose the devil, they live in hell, and they are responsible for this, not he."
Trump love to buy the cheap products himself?? The Maga hats and flags are china products
Who do you think pays that tax??????
This is how say china would pay the tariff . China says its 10 percent more walmart and walmart says we are not going to pay that we dont want it then china drops price 10 percent to not lose walmart therefore CHINA PAYS!!!
Isn’t he also proposing to make the government smaller.
"THIS IS A TAX AND IT WILL HURT BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER, BUSINESS DOESENT BENEFIT NOR DOES THE PEOPLE IT'S THE GOVERNMENT WHO GETS THE MONEY, THAT IS DONALD TRUMPS COFFERS. TRADE WAR WILL HURT BOTH SIDES. STAY STRONG CANADA LEAVE AMERICAN PRODUCTS ON THE SHELF."
"Back to the olden days. If we were had tariffs we'd have to make products here, have a smaller product landscape, but it would be identifiably AMERICAN. And if that doesn't suit you, leave."
3:40 it won’t cause inflation bud

"10:24 we can now stop sending 50 million to Gaza to fund condoms, as we can no longer afford it.

Income tax sucks because they will always find new places to spend your $"
Im a trump supporter.  Im listening to your point of view.  Curious how this all plays out
Is anyone going to mention that he only placed a 10% tariff on China where his own MAGA gear is manufactured?  Canada and Mexico get 25% but Maga hats and such only get 10%.  
I do not understand why so my people I know do not understand how tariffs work. And don't want to learn. I can't stand stupid and it's everywhere.
"Free Luigi, arm Luigi, fund Luigi!"
"When this is done, maybe it will be like China and the workforce will be cheap working for a 100 lbs of rice for 40 hours or 100 hours work.."
Bull not  ready for this
"Trump’s truth: Tariff’s go straight into my personal account. I”ll share a few million with my loyal subjects. Better than bibles, bobble heads and tacky golden shoes! Just another scam. "
Ur counter argument that the government is bigger now so they need more money so income taxes ok is a bad one because the whole issue is the government is as big as it is.
"So it's official, 25% tariff to all import from mexico &  canada and additional 10% tariff from china...."
No terrif on usa made goods
"I would have liked to have seen Trump, pre presidency, when he was doing business with China on his clothing line, and if Obama placed a huge tariff on Chinese goods. Trump would have gone through the roof!"
"I’m from a Red State, and I am proud of this move by Trump!  All 3 countries have not owned up to their part of the respective Trade Agreements. We are tired of getting F____ed over by these 3 countries."
We need to learn to pay more for American made goods. You don’t need all the clothes and shoes you buy. We consume in excess. I hope we can shift this a culture of decreased consumption. Every time we have a national disaster we are at the mercy of other countries
My Tacoma was built in Mexico
You're also forgetting who provides military protection for those countries 
"Holly crack, that’s how it work! Damn we should’ve voted for Trump years ago. The man is a genius!!!!"
Oh God not Charlie Kirk. My guy Parker smoked Charlie in a debate over abortion
Charge the tariff from the country of origin not from the importer
"When you say America, you mean the United States of AMERICA, right? The last time I checked the map America was the two continents combined, not a country."
"Your viewpoint is flawed. Trump tariffs are not directed at eliminating income tax but rather improving American manufacturing by Americans.  Yes,  Americans will pay more for imported goods with increased income from increased American job opportunities."
"Short term it will be bad for consumers 
Long term maybe"
"You tried to explain tariffs and its nature for price increases but the problem is the logical contradiction people are experiencing now.  Because tariffs work as any other taxes they increase prices , other taxes also increase prices. But media usually explain that additional tax for corporations won't increase prices but tariffs will increase. So this is logical contradiction which obfuscated everything. By the way Trump also contradicts himself when he speaks about the need to decrease taxes to boost business and at the same time to increase tariffs - which are also taxes. By the way - it is obvious that even Trump doesn't  believe in his words ; that tariffs are payed by foreign countries - if he believed he would made tariffs 1000% higher or more. Why not ??? if it's free money ?"
its not 10% eye roll
If Trump is in favour of tariffs it means he doesn't understand them.
I love the comment section everyone become global  experts  on everything 
Good
Who’s here after Trump enacted all of the tariffs 
We’ve got the greatest president in charge the greatest president in the world
this aged well
"Common sense =  rich don't  give a shit, average americans  will suffer."
More like 250 years ago before the union
It's more expensive to make things in The US. So Kirk is wrong.
"soo americans have to buy american made items to prevent inflation.. but the american made items will be sold less to other countryes. i am not shure it will make more jobs in usa, if they can not sell their products. it is well known that items produced in europe are better quality than usa made. if you really wish to sell more to the rest off the world , raise the quality in stead off makeing inflation."
Why Does China keep getting blamed for Fentynl going into America 
No tariff but high wage rates
FF two months and that 10% fell short of reality 
The issue Trump’s administration is doing is that they are lazy to come up with smart reformation that would actually benefit the country. They just want to abolish it and hope for the best.
Good
He is the stupid one! Tariffs at one time drove our company into the ground. That's why we didn't have them.
That's why DOGE is working to cut government expenses.
Finally i understand tarrifs
"Lol. My takeaway… Trump is all talk, but I think we all already knew that. Whether you like the way he rolls or not, I think we can all agree."
"Trump it's not a dumb person, he is very good at the art of manipulation which is sales. But he is clueless on economics and foreign policies"
"How about Americans appetite for Amazon and cheap Chinese plastic garbage slow down…

Just that alone would be a massive toll on china"
There will be no need to pass on the tarrif cost to American consumers because because under the trump administration American  businesses will benefit significantly from the largest tax cuts in American history from 21% to 15%
This didnt age well. Plus you forgot about DOGE to eliminate wasterfull government spending
"He is a sell out.  Or he probably does taxes for a living.   He does have a point, government was much smaller back then.  And that’s the very reason why Doge is making government smaller while reducing unnecessary spending."
Better start learning chinese. Is make china great
Inflationary. Stupid. The US is at full employment. Tariff is a tax paid for by the consumer. Meanwhile he stops funding health and other benefits to the American public. Now he’s blaming government employees. Has he ever admitted to making a mistake or taking responsibility? Not that I remember. $4Trillion of the deficit is due to his tax cut which expires this year.
So basical the working pore and blue collar people like plumers and tradesman and people and families that make less than 70k a  year already struggling are screwed 7 ways to hell because those oranges strawberrys  and 90 % of the food we buy will inflate 10× worse than now. If you have kids you cant afford strawberries at 10$ a pint as just one example groceries for 4 are already 200$ worth 3 or 4 days food.
The variable of wages need to be considered.. as well of the amount of debt. right now consumers have a choice to buy only USA made products. In the past Trump and Ivanka had a choice to make their products in the USA but decided to do it in China.. talk the talk but can walk the wall
"10% On China
25% On Canada
25% On Mexico
️️ %!!"
"Trump saying only “stupid people” or “drug pushers!” Excuse me who does he think he’s actually talking to?! He needs to watch his mouth here, cease being so rude! And I’ve seen him being rude to other people who want an answer or apology from him."
I must obey Trump!  He loves us all
"Well, it's been enacted."
Trumps got this. Pay up or open shop in America easy to understand might be a bit rocky in the beginning but it will all work out
Buy goods grown and  made in America and say no foreign goods!
I think that’s will be bad!
You do know that the tariffs are paid by you the consumer.
"If tariffs are self inflicted wounds to US citizens then why are mexico and canda threating retaliatory tariffs? Why not just let US citizens pay higher prices? The factor you are failing to mention is that we can absorb tariffs especially if it motivates us to produce domestically.. mexico and Canada can not .. we need a more equal trade deal with them ... Hopefully it forces them to the negotiating table before their countries go bankrupt..

You are also neglecting to mention that the tax environment is also important. Granted we can not complete when it comes to labor costs but we can offer a much better tax rate .. many companies would prefer doing business in a tax friendly country that can promise security.."
"That's why he's reducing taxes, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, drill baby drill, fixing the energy, so you gonna have more money so you can pay $160 or $180 vacuum with no problems. Or maybe the vacuum from the USA is gonna be cheaper. The economy is not only related to tariffs."
Fed: higher for much longer
Lumber to build our natural gas…. We shall see when the hard winter comes and  Canada needs agriculture. Your GDP is going to drop like a hot rock
"shit, way higher taxes on anything coming from USA and we are supposed to be part of America. We are Americans.."
A win for us and a win for Trump!!
"Tariff Bad for people, but good for the government."
Europe will happily buy from Canada.
"The Republicans are shrinking the government.  Also you're better off with large terrifs than income tax. Not everyone works, but everyone spends."
"Forget those Chinese vacuum cleaners, buy a German Sebo.
I'm 3 steps ahead of you.  National sale tax to fund our drunken sailor government.  They can raise it incrementally without anyone noticing."
Don't forget who is exempt after this term from taxes...answer Trump will be tax free as president.
"Don't worry people, your stimulus check is in the mail"
Firing most gov employees? Lol
"Guess your prediction that he will backpeddle or congress will stop him failed.  
Today, 2-1-2025 they took effect."
Grate 
Don't complain about global warming if all you are concerned about is buying your stuff cheaper.
"Maybe the mistake taht developing nations (like Mexico, Vietnam, India, Senegal, etc.) got trapped, was taht the most profitable market to be more profitable to produce goods for that US consumersnad to forget to produce the goods your market need. Mexico forgot to produce maiza corn in order to sell avocado to the US. Now that that avocado with a new tariff to products of the US firm and govt., avocado will bring less currency of hard dollars. So Trump will have to face the uS consumer will be angry to pay more for a good, ad might vote next election against the Republican Party. And the Mexican Govt., will have to face angry workers out of jobs. The whoe world could see the US as a very bad trade ally, voluble, aggressive and unreliable. Back to the 1960s, when the military govts suppress their angry voters."
"No hay fábricas, no hay mano de obra, no hay materia prima, o también es más caro producir localmente que por fuera eso es lo que Trump no entiende se tardan años para producir y ser competitivos no es en unos meses. Al final suponiendo que se logran todas las metas de tendrá que ser competitivo con el otro integrante, pero cuando él otro integrante tiene mejores condiciones naturales de producir lo mismo en mayor cantidad con mejor calidad y con precio competitivo aún que USA impulsa tarifas con impuestos eso no logrará que su mano de obra sea mejor que los países que están acostumbrados a ""sudar"" la camiseta para producir más mejor ya venir precio eso es lo que USA no entiende aparte todos los obstáculos que la reglamentación las normas, los sueldos y que más personas no quieren cueros trabajos. Eso Trump no lo entiende hoy si porque yo trabajé en los 2 países y sé lo que estoy diciendo. Así, que Donald Trump no va a ser USA great again, eso no es magia, es un estilo de vida, costumbre, naturalidad, ambiente, trabajo pero los más importante en Latinoamérica la gente sufre más para lograr lo mismo que el gringo."
Long term more good
He Is Now Smart Enough To Steal IT All !!! 
"The bully enters the classroom and taxes everybody.... As for tariffs on Canada let's not panic but be firm; Trump is used to surrounding boot lickers, let's intensely increase commerce with Mexico-Brazil-South-Africa-Europe with whom we should find more reliable partners"
simple companies need to stop freaking being so greedy .... like you make more than enough $ stop increasing prices when u dont have to Arizona did it so can other companies.
Now if he could just spell the wotd and understood it
"""nobody's perfect"" is holding alot of weight isn't it."
 the US $ will never be the international dollar! Already the BRICS are ditching the usd dollar. It will happen but take some time.
Bit coin needs electricity to work. Cash all the wayyyyyy
Trump has a second grader’s knowledge and now everything will go way higher
"Hmmm, why don't companies produce in America in the first place? "
"How much will us save, congress get a paid cut of 30%? human 1d10t..."
Lucky. We pay 91% on cars. So a car that cost 2k. Pay 3k to ship. 5k duty and tax. We dont manufacture anything on my third world country. Caribbean islands suck
"""RINOs exist"" lmao people out here really beliving a RINO is someone that just goes against Trump  Romney and Chaney voted on more of Trumps agenda his last term, yet just because they they dare oppose Trump, they are labeled ""RINO"". LMAO, Brian don't go throwing that term around so loosely."
"25% tariffs ,America is screwed...."
"Wow this means Trump would have been a loyalist “ Redcoat “ , during the Revolutionary War !!!"
"This is logic. As an American  imports are raising their price, I might as well pay high price for American made."
All you gave was two examples of American vacuums… This means they’ll be people that would want to open up a business to make vacuums cheaper to give us more jobs. That’s how that would work and then we stop buying these China made stuff that just breaks down anyways you know how many times I’ve been through These cheap made China vacuums. I spent more when I should’ve just bought a Hoover the first time.️️️ food for thought!!!
"If they make Toyota cars in the USA , the quality will drop! American workers are not as effective."
Very informative..very scary
"Screw it, I'm buying a bicycle!"
"Umm why are we using Charlie Kirk as a source? He isn't a nonbiased source you do know that right? WE PAY THE TARIFF!! If things are made here, they are MORE expensive! That's why companies buy from other countries! If anything, companies will buy products from other countries that don't have a tariff because if they use a country that has a tariff, the company needs to upcharge their prices due to these tariffs..."
Good thing DOGE is cutting inflation in other ways
"So how do we fix the prices? Sounds like there is no way unless Trump is cooking rn and everyone is about eat their own words 

ATP we are fucked regardless so fuck it"
Trump is indisputable in his ignorance! A fool is always right in his own mind!
10% too high.  Consumer Goods is 6% only
FDT
More good.
Pay more for quality
Trump is an idiot. Tariffs are paid by the company importing the goods and putting tariffs on any countries goods leads to a retaliatory action by that country
"Wait, who pays for it? Say it again."
"So, Trump is the voice of ignorance, as people now nothing about tax and economy, but he knows people will believe his lies."
President William mckinley tariffs in his time-line 
"6:24 I think you know alot more about Indian industries and waste management system. First clear your own US Tier 1 cities than show and put false allegation of polluting water and all trust me bro stuffs allegations on India. Either compete or get off the race,don't go that down to pull others feet."
"Mr importer , yes you will pass the tariff on me but I do have the option not to buy your product at the new price , so you either pay the tariffs yourself , no impact on my purse or inflation, or you can ate the whole overpriced French cheese yourself.  You still want to  sell 362,244 BMW vehicles in US , or only 20,000 ? Your call , pass the tariff on me and you’re out of the US market."
"He´s a liar, nothing about interpretation. He´s not stupid, he's just corrupt."
I think only red states should pay the tax since they voted the grifter in.
T rump isn’t human at all!
Tariffs won't be enough on 50% on China  yov bvgn China is rich rich not jvst rich trvst me we gonna be aight. . .
Still not taxing the rich rulers of the USA!
Do You know that all tariffs for imports are paid by amaericans? It doesnt matter for the export country.
They won’t work
All this is So bunch of BS...all Trump is Saying....Mexico get hands on...work on all these illegal immigrants coming across the border...
"There's a new slogan...
I would rather do without."
That’s why he is also reducing government spending !!! Big picture fool!
He didnt backtrack buddy
Government WASTE IS WAY MORE THAN 25%
"Trump will save us

He is our savor"
"Imponer aranceles a las productos haciéndolos más caros al consumidor final hacer que el consumidor busque mejores y más baratas alternativas eso es bueno cuando esas alternativas existen, pero que pasa cuando esas alternativas no existen? No hay fábricas, no hay mano de obra, no hay materia prima, o también es más caro producir localmente que por fuera eso es lo que Trump no entiende se tardan años para producir y ser competitivos no es en unos meses.

"How much does it cost to make a iPhone????
the argument in my opinion is the cost to make a product and how much we are over charged  in the end F America not no more rather do without........"
So all the gullible trump supporters are going to be buying more expensive products while banging on about How great tariffs are 
Trump good thanks thanks Trump 
Where's the supporting documentation on the 75 percent tarrifs? Just more inflammatory headline then begging watchers to subscribe. No thanks
"No , the proper question to ask is, can I live with myself when I buy my clothes from third world countries who use slave labour"
"Trump will use the money from Tariffs to lower taxes, he said it.  Do you think for a second those tax cut will go to us ?  Regular Americans will shoulder the increase in prices and the extra we pay goes into the tarrif fund where Trumpy will distribute it to his super rich friends…….dont worry though in  5-6 years some of that will trickle down to us ..maybe"
"The answer is simple, shrink the government by 80%."

"DOGE, lower or no income tax, qualify of life ... Look long term see the picture think outside of the box🇺🇲"
"Why tax imported items? Thats just tax on consumers, so if on food then you are charging poor people to pay more. So its badicaly taxing poor people eith 3xcuse you willcreate jobs and be able to pay debt of countey snd maybe pay the poor something back if left over, which will clealry be less back as they paid in first place.

Dude. Again you missing the point of moving companies to USA so THEY will pay MORE taxes. Stop ignoring this fact and stop focusing on tariffs.
IT WILL BE BAD FOR EVERYONE

Cut taxes for billionaires
This is misinformation. Wether the tariff is passed on to the consumer depends entirely on how well the purchasing officer can negotiate their manufacturing deals. This is assuming the companies lead weak negotiations with china and the others.

Not quite Bryan. They will raise prices not 10% but 14% to maintain their gross profit margin as a percent of cost. Thats how little Trump cares about us.

Trump like tariffs because it encourages companies to not depend on China as much as we are. If you import from Indian it’s a different story. I think you don’t really understand tariffs.
Your mouth runs on like diagram falls
Trump now has the house and the Senate. He has the floor man the more you talk the more you give me a headache.
tariff is a good thing
With Tarriff trump will win but deportation is complex
GREED

"@ClearValue - yeah the labor, raw materials, etc from the outside countries are cheaper, BUT you didn't really mentioned that when it reaches America, the prices are the same as HIGH as the goods sold here. Meaning, the MANUFACTURERS OR THE IMPORTERS are ripping off the consumers. For a NIKE shoes that you put as an example, you didn't mention how much the cost of making one pair of NIKE shoe - your video is non-transparent. Pure speculation. Fake news."

Go Trump….    This expert has no idea….
Ha ha. Learn math man. 10% of 4 trillion is 400 million. Which is exactly the same as your example that was “much less”. So it worked fine but now the exact (to the dollar) thing is crazy. Go back to your mom’s basement and study math. You just mathematically proved Trump is doing the right thing. Wa wa.
You're not telling the truth. Tariffs don't create inflation. Creating mo without support create inflation

Talking about tariffs on Canada and Mexico. 25%. That's coming on Saturday. That's coming on the first Saturday. But no oil tariff. No oil tariffs. No, I don't, well, I didn't say that you said that. No, I don't want to miss. No, we may or may not. We're going to make that determination probably tonight on oil, because they send us oil. We'll see. It depends on what the price is. If the oil is properly priced, if they treat us properly, we say down, look, Mexico and Canada have never been good to us on trade. They've treated us very unfairly in trade. And we will be able to make that up very quickly because we don't need the products that they have. We have all the oil you need. We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber. We have more than almost anybody in those two categories.
In oil. We have more than anybody, and we don't need anybody's trees. We have to free up some of the tree areas that we have. We have great lumber in this country. We have to free 'em up environmentally, which I can do very quickly, but we don't need what they have. And for us to be subsidizing Canada to the tune of 175 billion a year and subsidizing Mexico to the tune of 250 billion, 300 billion a year, and Mexico is a method of China sending in its product. And with China, I'm also thinking about something because they're sending Fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they're causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths. So China's going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we're in the process of doing that President. We'll make that determination of what it's going to be. But China has to stop sending Fentanyl into our country and killing our people. Mr. President.

On the tariffs. Is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight and should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10% to take

Effect? No room left for Mexico or for Canada? No. The tariffs, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow.

Mr. President, just a follow up on my colleagues' question,

And just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico, and as you know also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada, and China also had an additional 10. So it's 10 plus 10 and it comes in from Canada and it comes in from Mexico. That's a very important thing to say. Yeah, please go ahead.

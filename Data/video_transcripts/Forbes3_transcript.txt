Thank you, Mr. President.

Thank you.

This is hi Muto from on television. My question, let me ask a two quick, quick question.

Sure.

First, this is the first meeting between Mr. President and Prime Minister. So what kind of impression do you have on him? And number two, do you have an idea or do you have a plan to impose Tiff against Japan so far? Thank you.

I think that he is going to be a great prime minister. I think he's a very strong man, very, very strong. I have great respect for him. I've known him for a long time through a reputation Shinzo Abi thought the world of him, and I think he's going to do a fantastic job as Prime minister. Very strong person. I wish he wasn't so strong. I wish he was a little bit weaker than that, but that's what I got. I have to get strong guys all the time. He's going to be a great prime minister. I also, in terms of tariffs, I mean we're going to have tariffs, mostly reciprocal tariffs, where we go with, and I'm going to be probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday, have an announcement, probably a news conference, but probably reciprocal tariffs where a country pays so much or charges us so much and we do the same. So very reciprocal, because I think that's the only fair way to do it. That way. Nobody's hurt. They charge us, we charge them. It's the same thing. And I seem to be going in that line as opposed to a flat fee tariff. Okay.

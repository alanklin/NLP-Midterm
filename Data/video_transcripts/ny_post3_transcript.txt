Tonight I'm announcing Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against 155 billion worth of American goods. This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on 125 billion worth of American products in 21 days time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives like the American tariffs. Our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine, and bourbon, fruits and fruit juices, including orange juice along with vegetables, perfume, clothing, and juice. It'll include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.

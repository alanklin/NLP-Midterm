Impose tariff on the European Union.

What does that mean?

You're going to impose tariff too on European Union like you did, you're going to do for Mexico and Canada.

Well, you're asking me a question because I'm sure you didn't hear, am I going to impose tariffs on the European Union? Do you want the truthful answer or should I give you a political answer? Absolutely. Absolutely. The European Union has treated us so terribly.

You promised Americans to try to reduce costs, and so many of the products that would be tariffed when they come into the country, the outgoing country is not paying the tariff. The buyers in the United States pay that, and then that's passed on to consumers in most instances,

Sometimes

How?

>According to recent reports it has been stated that the export volume to the United States of petroleum crude is expected to double over the next several years. That is a significant number. So, even if this figure does not double, any important increase in this export volume together with a high tariff wall, will hit the everyday American hard and American businesses, too. 
>No country consumes as much oil as the United States, and Canada ranks in the top four in the world with its resource of confirmed oil reserves. The United States consumes more oil per day than the combined total of the next three countries, China, India and Japan. There is no more secure source of this vital resource than in the province of Alberta, Canada. 
>American refineries, as this writer understands the technology, were designed specifically to refine the type of crude that comes from Canada. The volume of crude coming from Canada into the United States is over four million barrels per day and this represents twenty to twenty-five percent, roughly, of the daily consumption rate in the US which is itself over twenty million barrels per day! Any tariffs by the Trump administration will hit hard and will hit immediately. 
>With regard to potash, Canada has a huge resource of this commodity. This potash is a secure source unlike some of the other sources. Canada produces 16 million tons per year, which is more than Russia, China and Belarus combined. So, where would the US prefer to source its potash? Add this to the enormous export of crude to the US and one can see how this imposition of a tariff would have a serious impact on the US everyday citizens, and especially in the agricultural sector. Commentators in the US present the notion that the US can absorb the tariffs on these exports to the US; however, every time an American citizen goes to the gas station or goes to the grocery store, they will see the true cost of these two tariffs immediately.
>Now, we have had trade disputes before between Canada and the US, but these were resolved through negotiations. All that crude being shipped to the US each day is heavily discounted. When analyzing the trade in crude it could very well be that Canada is 'subsidizing' the US. We here in North America had better start looking at the big picture, and the world, as it is changing.

Here are some key solutions:

 A Fair and Accessible Immigration Reform
The immigration system should be clearer and more humane, providing a real path to citizenship for those who have already built their lives in the U.S. It‚Äôs also crucial to offer more legal work and residency opportunities to reduce irregular immigration, while ensuring border security without separating families.

 Protecting Immigrants‚Äô Rights
No matter where you come from or your immigration status‚Äîeveryone deserves to be treated with dignity. It‚Äôs essential to eliminate discrimination, guarantee access to education, healthcare, and housing, and oversee immigration agencies to prevent abuses.

 Supporting Home Countries
Many people migrate out of necessity, not choice. If the U.S. invests in the development of home countries‚Äîcreating jobs, education, and stability‚Äîfewer people will be forced to leave their homes in search of better opportunities.

 A Cultural and Political Shift in the U.S.
To ensure immigrants are valued, society must be educated about their positive contributions. This means launching awareness campaigns, encouraging community integration, and supporting leaders who advocate for social justice.

 International Cooperation for a Better Future
The immigration issue is not just a U.S. problem‚Äîit‚Äôs global. Countries must work together to create solutions that benefit everyone, protect migrants' rights, and promote safe and orderly migration.

 Conclusion
If we act with humanity and commitment, we can transform the immigration system into one that is fair and equitable.

A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it‚Äôs clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift‚Äîperhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact‚Äîhigher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains‚Äîrevitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide.

Here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:

1. Tribalism & Political Identity
 ‚Ä¢ Many Americans strongly identify with their political party, and Trump has become the dominant figure in the Republican Party. People often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.
 ‚Ä¢ Once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.

2. Confirmation Bias
 ‚Ä¢ People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.
 ‚Ä¢ Supporters often rely on conservative media sources (Fox News, Newsmax, Breitbart), which reinforce Trump‚Äôs narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.

3. Charismatic & Populist Messaging
 ‚Ä¢ Trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.
 ‚Ä¢ His simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.

4. Mistrust of Traditional Media & Institutions
 ‚Ä¢ Trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù This creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.
 ‚Ä¢ Many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe Trump over the media or experts.

5. Emotional Appeal & Fear-Based Messaging
 ‚Ä¢ Trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.
 ‚Ä¢ When people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader‚Äîeven if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.

6. Economic & Cultural Factors
 ‚Ä¢ Many supporters feel that Trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don‚Äôt fully support it.
 ‚Ä¢ Others see him as defending traditional American values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice movements).

7. Repetition & Social Influence
 ‚Ä¢ Trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.
 ‚Ä¢ If a person‚Äôs friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.

Bottom Line:

People believe Trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. Once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts.",,"people believe donald trump for a variety of reasons, and their support is often based on psychological, political, and social factors rather than just factual accuracy. here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:  1. tribalism & political identity  ‚Ä¢ many americans strongly identify with their political party, and trump has become the dominant figure in the republican party. people often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.  ‚Ä¢ once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.  2. confirmation bias  ‚Ä¢ people tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.  ‚Ä¢ supporters often rely on conservative media sources (fox news, newsmax, breitbart), which reinforce trump‚Äôs narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.  3. charismatic & populist messaging  ‚Ä¢ trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.  ‚Ä¢ his simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.  4. mistrust of traditional media & institutions  ‚Ä¢ trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù this creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.  ‚Ä¢ many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe trump over the media or experts.  5. emotional appeal & fear-based messaging  ‚Ä¢ trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.  ‚Ä¢ when people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader‚Äîeven if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.  6. economic & cultural factors  ‚Ä¢ many supporters feel that trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don‚Äôt fully support it.  ‚Ä¢ others see him as defending traditional american values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, lgbtq+ rights, racial justice movements).  7. repetition & social influence  ‚Ä¢ trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.  ‚Ä¢ if a person‚Äôs friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.  bottom line:  people believe trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts."

A Few Caveats
Complex Supply Chains:
Many products sold in the U.S. are assembled from components that may come from several countries. Even if a significant portion is imported from Mexico or Canada, only that portion might be affected by the tariff.

Price Absorption:
Manufacturers and retailers sometimes absorb part of a tariff (or adjust production) so that the full increase isn‚Äôt passed directly to consumers.

Market Factors:
Competition, brand positioning, and alternative sourcing might reduce or delay any direct price increases.

Estimates:
The prices listed above are illustrative examples based on current average prices. Actual price changes would depend on numerous factors including production costs, supply‚Äêchain adjustments, and market conditions.

In Summary
If an everyday item that costs $X now is entirely imported from Mexico or Canada and faces a 25‚Äëpercent tariff, its price might be expected to rise to about $1.25√óX. The examples above‚Äîfrom cars to a 6‚Äëpack of beer or a gallon of milk‚Äîoffer one way to visualize that impact.

Keep in mind these numbers are rough estimates intended to illustrate the potential effect of such a tariff on consumer prices.",,"30 common items from mexico or canada  1. automobiles example: a mid‚Äësize car current price: $25,000 after tariff (√ó1.25): $31,250 2. pickup trucks example: a full‚Äësize pickup current price: $35,000 after tariff: $43,750 3. suvs example: a family suv current price: $30,000 after tariff: $37,500 4. car tires (set of 4) current price: $400 after tariff: $500 5. automotive parts example: a set of brake pads current price: $120 after tariff: $150 6. mexican beer (6‚Äëpack) current price: $10 after tariff: $12.50 7. avocados current price: $1.00 each after tariff: $1.25 each 8. tomatoes (per pound) current price: $2.00 after tariff: $2.50 9. bell peppers current price: $1.50 each after tariff: approximately $1.88 each 10. lettuce (head) current price: $2.00 after tariff: $2.50 11. cheese (1‚Äëpound block) current price: $5.00 after tariff: $6.25 12. milk (gallon) current price: $3.50 after tariff: about $4.38 13. plywood (4‚Ä≤√ó8‚Ä≤ sheet, from canada) current price: $40.00 after tariff: $50.00 14. lumber (2√ó4, 8‚Äëfeet) current price: $3.00 after tariff: $3.75 15. paper towels (6‚Äëpack) current price: $10.00 after tariff: $12.50 16. aluminum cans (pack of 24) current price: $6.00 after tariff: $7.50 17. refrigerator (appliance made in mexico) current price: $1,000 after tariff: $1,250 18. air conditioner (unit from mexico) current price: $500 after tariff: $625 19. washing machine current price: $600 after tariff: $750 20. sofa (furniture made in mexico) current price: $800 after tariff: $1,000 21. television (mid‚Äësize, assembled in mexico) current price: $300 after tariff: $375 22. computer monitor current price: $200 after tariff: $250 23. t‚Äëshirt (clothing made in mexico) current price: $20 after tariff: $25 24. jeans current price: $40 after tariff: $50 25. sneakers (pair, made in mexico) current price: $50 after tariff: $62.50 26. seafood (e.g. salmon from canada, per pound) current price: $15 after tariff: $18.75 27. maple syrup (bottle from canada) current price: $10 after tariff: $12.50 28. medical supplies (box of surgical gloves from canada) current price: $15 after tariff: $18.75 29. construction windows (imported from canada) current price: $200 after tariff: $250 30. household cleaning spray (made in mexico) current price: $4.00 after tariff: $5.00  a few caveats complex supply chains: many products sold in the u.s. are assembled from components that may come from several countries. even if a significant portion is imported from mexico or canada, only that portion might be affected by the tariff.  price absorption: manufacturers and retailers sometimes absorb part of a tariff (or adjust production) so that the full increase isn‚Äôt passed directly to consumers.  market factors: competition, brand positioning, and alternative sourcing might reduce or delay any direct price increases.  estimates: the prices listed above are illustrative examples based on current average prices. actual price changes would depend on numerous factors including production costs, supply‚Äêchain adjustments, and market conditions.  in summary if an everyday item that costs $x now is entirely imported from mexico or canada and faces a 25‚Äëpercent tariff, its price might be expected to rise to about $1.25√óx. the examples above‚Äîfrom cars to a 6‚Äëpack of beer or a gallon of milk‚Äîoffer one way to visualize that impact.  keep in mind these numbers are rough estimates intended to illustrate the potential effect of such a tariff on consumer prices."

Due to the unfair 25% tariffs imposed by  U.S. President Donald Trump on Canadian goods, businesses across Canada will now only accept U.S. currency at par. This means that $1 USD will be treated as $1 CAD, regardless of exchange rates.

Tariffs will protect domestic manufacturers, enabling them to scale production, innovate, and reduce costs through economies of scale. As industries expand, job creation will strengthen the labor market, increase wages, and boost consumer spending, reinforcing economic prosperity. Foreign exporters will lower prices or absorb tariff costs to maintain market share, preventing price hikes. Reduced reliance on imports will secure national self-sufficiency, shielding America from global supply disruptions and trade imbalances. A stronger U.S. dollar or foreign currency devaluation will offset tariff costs, ensuring affordability.

In fact it's been acknowledged by practically every serious economic historian as being the single most disastrous policy blunder in US history, which ended up pouring fuel on the already-burning wreckage of the Great Depression.

The primary reason? Beyond the obvious inflationary squeeze of higher domestic prices, these tariffs provoked immediate and brutal retaliation from other nations! The result was that Americans got slapped with higher costs on not just their imports, but on their exports as well, in addition to having to deal with the spectacular collapse of most international trade.

And the world‚Äôs economy suffocated as most US domestic investors along with all foreign venture capital crap-shoot speculators vanished into thin air. And this choked the domestic and international money supply, which intensified the crushing deflation that defined the 1930s.

Any historian that knows anything about economics and has at least half a brain, will tell you that the Smoot-Hawley Act was protectionism at its most self-destructive. It was a policy disaster of epic proportions that made a terrible situation catastrophically worse.

And this Fox News clown and Trump economist is suggesting that these Tarrifs were the best thing America ever did since the invention of the light bulb. And furthermore, that everyone apart from him is simply too ignorant to realise this, because of course he's read a quote in a history book by Thucydides. God bless the liberal arts curriculum. 

Yes indeed, you really do have to admire Charles Payne for starting off his analysis by quoting Thucydides from his history of the Peloponnesian War: ""Most people in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth from politically unbiased, serious economic historians, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear from some two-bit Fox News shock-jock business analyst, who doesn't know the first thing about economics.""",,"the deflation of the 1930s that's casually glossed over here was due to the unprecedented wave of bank failures and the wiping out of deposits, thereby reducing the amount of money in circulation.  so it wasn‚Äôt just a low level of inflation (which, if kept within a certain range, is manageable); it was full-blown ""deflation"" (negative inflation), which is an entirely different beast that depending on its severity, can be downright catastrophic.  and to make matters worse, the us federal reserve, rather than increasing liquidity and expanding the money supply, responded by tightening monetary policy, triggering a loss of confidence as people hoarded cash instead of spending or depositing it, further restricting money circulation.  so in reality!!! the smoot-hawley tariff act of 1930 which jacked up u.s. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, was not a good thing. in fact it's been acknowledged by practically every serious economic historian as being the single most disastrous policy blunder in us history, which ended up pouring fuel on the already-burning wreckage of the great depression.  the primary reason? beyond the obvious inflationary squeeze of higher domestic prices, these tariffs provoked immediate and brutal retaliation from other nations! the result was that americans got slapped with higher costs on not just their imports, but on their exports as well, in addition to having to deal with the spectacular collapse of most international trade.  and the world‚Äôs economy suffocated as most us domestic investors along with all foreign venture capital crap-shoot speculators vanished into thin air. and this choked the domestic and international money supply, which intensified the crushing deflation that defined the 1930s.  any historian that knows anything about economics and has at least half a brain, will tell you that the smoot-hawley act was protectionism at its most self-destructive. it was a policy disaster of epic proportions that made a terrible situation catastrophically worse.  and this fox news clown and trump economist is suggesting that these tarrifs were the best thing america ever did since the invention of the light bulb. and furthermore, that everyone apart from him is simply too ignorant to realise this, because of course he's read a quote in a history book by thucydides. god bless the liberal arts curriculum.   yes indeed, you really do have to admire charles payne for starting off his analysis by quoting thucydides from his history of the peloponnesian war: ""most people in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth from politically unbiased, serious economic historians, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear from some two-bit fox news shock-jock business analyst, who doesn't know the first thing about economics."""

1. The Decline of Manufacturing and Global Outsourcing

Since the 1980s, the U.S. has increasingly shifted toward a service-based economy, relocating major manufacturing industries like automobiles, shipbuilding, and heavy chemicals to countries such as China and Mexico. This led to job losses and economic stagnation in many industrial regions.

2. The Impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis

The financial crisis, driven by the housing bubble and excessive risk-taking in the financial sector, severely impacted the U.S. economy. In contrast, manufacturing powerhouses like China and Germany suffered less damage, as their economies were more resilient to financial turmoil.

3. China's Rise and America's Relative Decline

China became the ""world‚Äôs factory"", gaining economic dominance over global supply chains. With strong industrial policies and technological advancements, China now competes with the U.S. in key sectors such as semiconductors, batteries, and artificial intelligence.

4. The Return of Protectionism and America-First Policies

As economic hardship grew, many Americans felt that their jobs were being outsourced, fueling support for Trump‚Äôs ""America First"" agenda. His policies focused on protectionism, anti-China measures, and reshoring manufacturing jobs, which resonated with struggling workers.

5. Efforts to Revive Manufacturing, but Challenges Remain

The Trump administration is also pushing to rebuild key industries like semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy within the U.S. However, high production costs and labor shortages make a full manufacturing revival difficult.

Ultimately, the decline of U.S. manufacturing and China‚Äôs rise have created long-term structural challenges for the American economy, leading to growing nationalism and protectionist policies.",,"why the u.s. economy is struggling: the collapse of manufacturing  1. the decline of manufacturing and global outsourcing  since the 1980s, the u.s. has increasingly shifted toward a service-based economy, relocating major manufacturing industries like automobiles, shipbuilding, and heavy chemicals to countries such as china and mexico. this led to job losses and economic stagnation in many industrial regions.  2. the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis  the financial crisis, driven by the housing bubble and excessive risk-taking in the financial sector, severely impacted the u.s. economy. in contrast, manufacturing powerhouses like china and germany suffered less damage, as their economies were more resilient to financial turmoil.  3. china's rise and america's relative decline  china became the ""world‚Äôs factory"", gaining economic dominance over global supply chains. with strong industrial policies and technological advancements, china now competes with the u.s. in key sectors such as semiconductors, batteries, and artificial intelligence.  4. the return of protectionism and america-first policies  as economic hardship grew, many americans felt that their jobs were being outsourced, fueling support for trump‚Äôs ""america first"" agenda. his policies focused on protectionism, anti-china measures, and reshoring manufacturing jobs, which resonated with struggling workers.  5. efforts to revive manufacturing, but challenges remain  the trump administration is also pushing to rebuild key industries like semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy within the u.s. however, high production costs and labor shortages make a full manufacturing revival difficult.  ultimately, the decline of u.s. manufacturing and china‚Äôs rise have created long-term structural challenges for the american economy, leading to growing nationalism and protectionist policies."

Economic efficiency is achieved when a product or service is produced or rendered at the lowest possible cost.

Examples:

It is much cheaper to grow oranges outdoors in tropical Florida than in Massachusetts' expensive greenhouses. This is due to Florida's favorable growing conditions, lower labor costs, and cost of living. So, we buy oranges from Florida.

The U.S. can import bamboo from Asia much more cheaply than it could be produced domestically, due to better growing conditions and cheap labor. So, we buy bamboo from Asia.

This forms the basis of trade.

The U.S. is currently importing billions more of these countries' products than it is exporting, creating a trade deficit and 8n some cases, violating trade agreements.

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2024, Canada imposes a tariff on dairy products imported from the United States. The tariff rates vary depending on the type and quantity of dairy products.
Class 7 Milk: 3.65% tariff
Ultrafiltered Milk: 14% tariff
Whey Protein Concentrate: 10% tariff
Butter: 298% tariff (yes, you read that right - nearly 300%!)
Cheese: 245% tariff
These tariffs were imposed as part of Canada's dairy supply management system, which aims to protect domestic dairy farmers and processors. However, it's worth noting that these tariffs have been a point of contention between the US and Canada, with the US arguing that they are unfair and restrict American dairy exports.

The idea that the United States ‚Äúsubsidizes‚Äù Canada to the tune of $200 billion annually is an erroneous interpretation of the economic and energy relationship between the two nations. This claim lacks the analytical rigor necessary to withstand scrutiny when we consider the facts. First, Canada is a critical supplier of energy to the U.S., providing a substantial portion of its crude oil and natural gas needs.

The United States also imports 98% of Canada‚Äôs natural gas, an essential resource that powers homes and industries across the U.S. during the colder months EIA . This energy exchange is a matter of mutual necessity, not a one-sided dependency. The term ""subsidy"" implies one party is providing financial support to the other. In this context, it is crucial to distinguish between a trade relationship and a financial aid arrangement. The energy Canada provides is not given as a charity or a handout; it is sold at market prices, reflecting the value of the resources being exchanged. The United States, in return, exports over $300 billion in goods to Canada annually, including vehicles, machinery, and technology EIA . This reciprocal trade benefits both economies and underpins millions of jobs on both sides of the border.

Canada is not merely a passive recipient of American protection; the two countries cooperate through NORAD and share responsibility for the defense of North America. Canada‚Äôs military, though smaller than that of the U.S., plays an active role in peacekeeping and global security efforts. The assumption that Canada ""FREELOADS"" on the U.S. military is therefore logically flawed and ignores decades of joint action. In sum, this claim of a ""$200 billion subsidy"" does not withstand scrutiny when examined through the lens of facts. Canada‚Äôs role as a supplier of essential resources to the U.S. is a mutual exchange, one that supports both economies.

Trump isn't talking about just targeting China or only applying limited tariffs on a specific sector that needs protected from foreign dumping.  He is talking about universal tariffs on all imports, even from our allies and countries that we have tried to boost economically as part of stopping illegal immigration.  2. It sickens me to hear this man who won't feel a bit of pain in his personal life from the disruption and high prices many of us will struggle with if he gets his way just shrug off the harm this will do to so many by saying we could just switch back in a decade if it doesn't work.

I suggest people read up on the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the early 20th century that led to the Great Depression. If he follows through on his plans, we could be looking at something very similar.

It's not that I completely disagree with the idea of relying less on China to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  But placing tariffs on ALL imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  INSTEAD of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from North, Central, and South America, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a US company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the U.S.  It would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  It would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the U.S. for work.    It would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the Panama Canal, because U.S. and Canadian imports from Mexico, C.A. and S.A. could come by train.  But Trump is the President now, so I guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve OUR (not just HIS) goals.

Eroding Trust Among Trade Partners: Tariffs create a rift between countries, making it harder to build strong, trusting relationships that are crucial for long-term economic growth.

Fueling Division and Tribalism: Instead of fostering unity, tariffs can deepen divisions, pitting groups against each other and creating a climate of hostility that can hinder cooperation.

Misallocation of Resources: The financial and human resources spent on implementing and managing tariffs could be better invested elsewhere, like innovation and infrastructure, which genuinely drive growth.

Driving Up Prices for Consumers: Tariffs often lead to higher costs for everyday products, making life a little tougher for families trying to make ends meet and pushing inflation in the wrong direction.

Empowering Authoritarian Regimes: By prioritizing tariffs over diplomacy, there's a risk of unintentionally bolstering authoritarian leaders who thrive on nationalistic sentiments, undermining global democratic values.

Especially when the goods has labor cost is higher than the raw material cost. When an good that is sold at $100, where the labor is at $30, and material at $20, with $50 profit, but if you give it a 100% tax, it's now selling at $200 dollars, allowing you to take (in theory) $100 for every $30 paid to labor (in China or India) and for every $50 the manufacture profits... but still it's NOT going to bring those jobs back to United States, because the labor cost in USA would be at $150 to $300 just to make a $200-product, and the profitabiliy of something sold at $200 minus the labor $150 and material $20, would only be $30 profit, at 15% ($30/$200) profitability, it's not going to attract any business to move its base back into United States... 

Meanwhile, people who used to be able to buy stuff at $100, now would have to buy it at $200, or even at $300 for products made in USA... it would have a short-term pain for the average households, and a long term drop in trade.

He was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. As a Congressman, he was responsible for the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect American industries. Later, as president, he signed the Dingley Tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in U.S. history until the 1930s.

However, McKinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. He began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. This was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage U.S. exports.

Why Was McKinley Assassinated?
McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. Czolgosz believed that McKinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. Inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the Pan-American Exposition. The president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on September 14, 1901. His assassination led to Theodore Roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the Progressive Era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy.",,"no, president william mckinley did not abandon his tariff policy. he was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. as a congressman, he was responsible for the mckinley tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect american industries. later, as president, he signed the dingley tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in u.s. history until the 1930s.  however, mckinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. he began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. this was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage u.s. exports.  why was mckinley assassinated? mckinley was assassinated on september 6, 1901, in buffalo, new york, by leon czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. czolgosz believed that mckinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of king umberto i of italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.  czolgosz shot mckinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the pan-american exposition. the president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on september 14, 1901. his assassination led to theodore roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the progressive era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy."

A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it‚Äôs clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift‚Äîperhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact‚Äîhigher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains‚Äîrevitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

(Applying the VCEC Theory 2.0)

When a competing economy (e.g., China or the EU) enters a deflationary spiral, the following self-reinforcing cycle occurs:

1. Falling Prices Lead to Margin Collapse
Overproduction and weak demand force price cuts, but lower prices don‚Äôt stimulate new demand (especially for durable goods like cars or appliances).
Profit margins shrink, making it harder for businesses to cover costs.
Companies desperately cut costs, slash wages, and lay off workers, further reducing demand.
 Example:

Chinese EV makers slash prices, but demand remains stagnant.
Low margins force weaker companies into bankruptcy, and job losses weaken domestic consumption.

2. Capital Flight & Currency Depreciation
Investors pull capital out of the struggling economy to seek safer, higher-yield assets (often in U.S. markets).
The local currency weakens due to capital outflows and collapsing corporate earnings.
A weaker currency raises import costs, worsening profitability for businesses relying on foreign components.
 Example:

China experiences capital flight to USD assets, further weakening the yuan.
Higher import costs on essential goods (e.g., semiconductors, energy) increase financial strain.

3. The U.S. Economy Strengthens from the Spiral
Foreign capital flows into U.S. Treasuries, stocks, and real estate, strengthening the dollar.
A strong USD lowers U.S. import costs, reducing inflationary pressures.
U.S. consumers maintain spending power, while competitors suffer from currency weakness.
 Example:

The strong dollar makes imported goods (oil, semiconductors) cheaper for the U.S.
Tariffed goods become more expensive for the competitor but not for the U.S., as production shifts elsewhere (e.g., Mexico, Vietnam).

4. Trade War Intensifies: Tariffs & Market Fragmentation
The U.S. exploits the competitor‚Äôs weakness by increasing tariffs or restricting market access to slow their recovery.
A collapsing competitor‚Äôs market means excess supply floods into weaker economies, creating a race to the bottom in pricing.
Tariffs block competitors from dumping excess supply into high-margin Western markets, forcing them into low-profit secondary markets (Africa, Latin America).
 Example:

China‚Äôs EVs are hit with 100% tariffs in the U.S. and EU, forcing them to sell at near-zero margins in poorer markets.
U.S. and EU firms gain market share, while BYD and other Chinese firms face financial collapse before Tesla or Ford feel pressure.

5. Economic Collapse Triggers Political Instability
Widespread factory closures, job losses, and economic stagnation fuel internal unrest.
Government bailouts fail to restore growth, leading to long-term stagnation (Japan‚Äôs ""Lost Decades"" scenario).
Political leaders turn to protectionism, stimulus, or military posturing to distract from economic failure.
 Example:

China struggles to contain financial fallout from failing industries and introduces state bailouts, which only delay collapse.
Export-driven economies like Germany suffer as global demand weakens, triggering an EU economic crisis.

6. U.S. Firms Win the Long-Term Game (Innovation + Market Control)
The U.S. absorbs capital, talent, and investment, further expanding its tech and financial sector dominance.
Companies in AI, semiconductors, and autonomous vehicles accelerate their lead over struggling competitors.
Full self-driving technology, AI-driven supply chains, and automation create new economic moats that competitors cannot match.
 Example:

Tesla, Google (Waymo), and U.S. AI firms dominate self-driving and Edge AI, making low-cost EV production irrelevant.
China‚Äôs focus on cutting EV prices becomes obsolete as AI-driven vehicle networks reshape the auto market.
Final Outcome: The U.S. Turns the Competitor‚Äôs Crisis into a Self-Reinforcing Economic Advantage
 Deflation in a competitor‚Äôs market weakens their ability to compete globally.
 Capital flight strengthens the USD, lowering U.S. import costs and sustaining domestic consumption.
 Tariffs block competitor recovery, forcing them into financial ruin before U.S. firms feel pressure.
 Technological dominance (AI, self-driving) becomes the real economic battleground, rendering low-cost production irrelevant.

 Final Take: If China or another major competitor falls into a deflationary spiral, the U.S. absorbs global capital, strengthens the dollar, blocks economic recovery through tariffs, and advances AI dominance‚Äîcementing its long-term economic supremacy.

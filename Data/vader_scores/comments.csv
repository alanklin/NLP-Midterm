Im guessing the 10% tariff on China was not intended to hurt China but essentially redistribute money from US companies or the public to the US government by using Chinese goods. Because people will buy Chinese goods regardless of a small increase in Tariff, the US knows it, it will unlikely affect the trade volume with China. But if you're going to do so, there needs to be prior communication with China, you cant simply use another countries goods to re-direct money flow in your economy without asking first. China most likely knows it too. But as you can see, all of the goods ta-riffed on China are easily replaceable either in house or by China's good neighbor Russia.

As countries respond with retaliatory measures, it’s a reminder of the interconnected world we live in. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 15:1, ""A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."" Instead of letting conflicts escalate, maybe we should focus on finding peaceful solutions that benefit everyone. Trade, like relationships, works best when based on mutual respect and understanding.

=====================

1) 我们中华民族是一个有着五千年文明历史的国家, 虽然我们在近代的两百年落后了, 但我们仍然要挺起脊梁!!! 完全没有必要因为需要发展经济, 而去迁就美国或是西方的任何无理而又霸道的行为! 无论外部环境的好坏, 我们发展经济以及提高科技实力都要靠我们自己, 而不是任何国家的恩惠!!!🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳

2) 中国与俄罗斯的友好关系的历史价值不仅仅在于当今的世界格局，更要从中国的几千年的大历史来看!!!

The HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE of the MUTUAL BENEFICIAL FRIENDSHIP between China and Russia lies NOT ONLY IN THE CONTEMPORARY GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS BUT ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS’ OUR CHINESE HISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY!!!
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺


衷心祝愿中国与俄罗斯的双边贸易能够在市场的原则下更上一层楼!!! 

I SINCERELY hope that under the principle of the Market Economy, the BILATERAL TRADE between China and Russia will CLIMB UP TO ANOTHER ALTITUDE!!!  

3) Both Chinese President Xi and Russian President Putin are GREAT contemporary world leaders! Under their leadership, both China and Russia will not only restore the past glories of our two countries respectively, BUT ALSO HAVE PERMANENT ECONOMIC PROSPERITIES AND BRIGHT FUTURES !!! 
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺
 

4) 历史证明这些甘当美帝国主义走狗的人或国家绝不会有好下场!!!
The past thirty years’ history has demonstrated that those DEPRAVED THUGS AND TRAITORS who SHAMELESSLY WANT to be the RUNNING DOGS of American hegemony HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DOOMED INTO THE THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!

5) Taiwan has been part of China since 15th century! TAIWAN WILL REUNITE WITH THE MAINLAND CHINA IN THE NEAR FUTURE!!! NO COUNTRY on this planet can block this IRREVERSIBLE TREND OF HISTORY! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality WILL BE DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!! 

只有统一台湾，我们中华民族才能完全洗刷自鸦片战争以来的一百多年我们被西方列强所任意欺辱的历史!!!

REUNITING WITH TAIWAN IS THE LAST STEP FOR OUR CHINESE PEOPLE TO FINALLY GET RID OF THE STIGMA of the more than one hundred years’ decline of China since the Opium Wars!!!

南沙群岛以及周边水域自古以来就是中国领土的一部分! 强烈支持中国海警对南海水域的巡逻执法!!! 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳  

6)  历史终将会对冷战结束以后的这段历史进行审判! 那些挂羊头卖狗肉以上一届美国拜登政府为首的厚颜无耻的西方政治骗子们终将会遗臭万年!!!
In fact, THOSE SINISTER HYPOCRITICAL TOP OFFICIALS OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OF U.S GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS ITS ALLIES ARE THE VERY PERSONS WHO SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH COMMITTING THE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!!

7) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which has been the FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES of many EVILNESSES in the contemporary world since the end of Cold War!

a) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand always emphasizes its championing of the so called western values, and on the other hand is supporting Israel’s bombing of hospitals in Gaza right now!!!

b) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims that the U.S. is the beacon of the world, and on the other hand MAKE FORTUNE by promoting hatreds between countries or between different ethnic groups and then selling weapons to countries or ethnic groups in the conflicts!!!

c) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims its support of market economy and free trade, and on the other hand keeps WHIMSICALLY suppressing and containing Chinese high-tech companies!!!

8)  美式民主= 劳民伤财+ 政治蠢货
American democracy = WASTING MONEY + POLITICAL MORONS  

️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️
G7 is EVIL7!!!

以美国为首的西方政治蠢货们还在做着两百多年前的西方霸权梦! 可惜现如今不是1924年!! 而是2024年!!! 应该看清现实的是欧洲的那些政治蠢货们!!! 欧洲的这些政治蠢货们越跟在美国的后面充当美国霸权的走狗, 这些国家就会变得越无足轻重!!!

IT IS THOSE DELUSIONAL WESTERN POLITICAL MORONS WHO NEED TO WAKE UP from their DAYDREAM of western hegemony!!! RIGHT NOW IT IS 2024 not 1924!!! Those DELUSIONAL European political MORONS should understand that THE MORE they follow the American HEGEMONIC policies, THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT THESE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL BECOME!!! 
️️️️️️️️️️️

9) 美国政府对中国的高科技产业的打压只会是搬起石头砸自己的脚!!!
All the efforts made by the  U.S. government to suppress and contain the development of Chinese high-tech industries will be FUTILE!!! 

NEITHER the United States NOR any other country on this planet can block the progress of People’s Republic of China!!! The U.S. government can ONLY BLOCK THE PROGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF!!! 

那些唱衰中国经济的人们, 到头来只会是唱衰了他们本国的经济!!!
Those people who are betting the decline of Chinese economy WILL ULTIMATELY FACE THE REALITY OF ECONOMIC DECLINE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY!!!

10) 世界的和平与繁荣发展需要的是多建设桥梁与铁路, 而不是在不同的种族, 宗教或不同的意识形态之间散播仇恨! 更不是以捍卫民主自由为名, 行战争贩子之实,以各种形式不断地卖武器, 大发战争的不义之财!!!

To achieve the LONG-TERM PEACE AND PROSPERITY, we need to BUILD MORE BRIDGES AND HIGH-SPEED RAILROADS around the world, NOT to spread hatreds between different ethnicities, religions or between different ideologies! Unfortunately, in the name of promoting democracy the U.S. government and its western allies are CONSTANTLY SELLING WEAPONS in various forms and SHAMELESSLY MAKE FORTUNES by sacrificing millions of innocent lives without any hesitation! 

11) The period of thirty years after the collapse of the former Soviet Union is NOT an equilibrium state, BUT A TRANSITIONAL STATE, during which the world experienced constant violences and wars! This uni-polar world dominated by American hegemony will be replaced by an EPOCH-MAKING multi-polar world, and NO ONE can block this IRREVERSIBLE historical trend! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality will be DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!  

12) The system of BRICS countries has become and will continue to be one of the most important polars in this BURGEONING MULTI-POLAR world!  

Warmly Welcome Indonesia 🇮🇩to become the FULL member of BRICS system.
Warmly welcome Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Algeria, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Vietnam, Venezuela, as well as other countries to apply for the membership of the BRICS system!
🇧🇷🇷🇺🇮🇳🇨🇳🇿🇦🇪🇬🇪🇹🇮🇩🇮🇷🇦🇪🇧🇾🇧🇴🇨🇺🇰🇿🇲🇾 🇹🇭🇺🇬🇺🇿🇩🇿🇳🇬🇸🇦🇻🇳🇻🇪

青山遮不住, 毕竟东流去！
历史发展的大趋势谁也无法阻挡!!!

It is the HEGEMONIC POWER of the U. S. which is DIMINISHING!!! 

13) By ARBITRARILY imposing economic sanctions against other countries, the U.S. government is DIGGING THE GRAVE for the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency of international trade!

14) People around the world should be UNITED TO FIGHT AGAINST American hegemony!
当今世界苦美国的霸权与霸道久矣!!!
=====================

支持双方立即停火!!!
支持巴勒斯坦人的合法权利!!!
支持巴勒斯坦国加入联合国!!!
支持""两国的""解决巴以冲突的方案!
🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳🇵🇸🇨🇳

The ratio of people who have been killed for Israeli vs Palestinian since October 7, 2023, is 1200 : 47000! Even children in the kindergarten know which number is bigger!!! 

The DOUBLE-STANDARD of the U.S and its allies fully demonstrates that MOST of WESTERN politicians are HYPOCRITICAL RACISTS!!!

ACTIONS SPEAK MUCH LOUDER THAN EMPTY WORDS!!!

CEASEFIRE IMMEDIATELY!!!
SUPPORT PALESTINIAN!!!
SUPPORT THE PALESTINE’S FULL U.N. MEMBERSHIP!!!
SUPPORT THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION!!!

2,bbc_news,Center,44.73,-1.33,0.825,-0.8891,"Imposing a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports could backfire on the U.S. by raising costs for businesses and consumers, triggering retaliatory tariffs, and straining trade relations. Since industries like automotive, agriculture, and manufacturing rely on North American supply chains, higher import costs will increase prices, inflation, and job losses. The U.S. auto industry, for example, will face higher production costs, making vehicles more expensive and less competitive. Canada and Mexico will likely retaliate with tariffs on key U.S. exports, hurting American farmers and manufacturers who depend on these markets. Declining sales in soybeans, corn, dairy, and beef could lead to financial losses and farm closures. These tariffs could also damage diplomatic relations, undermining the USMCA and pushing Canada and Mexico to strengthen trade with Europe and China, reducing U.S. influence. Politically, rising costs and job losses could spark a public backlash, pressuring policymakers to reverse the decision. While intended to strengthen the U.S. economy, these tariffs may ultimately do more harm than good."

At the end of Trump's first term, I hoped we could have a peaceful transition of power to the Biden administration and forget about the worst presidents we have ever had.

On inauguration day, I was hopeful he would be all-talk like his last presidential term and allow us to mend relations. I was unfortunate to learn he did otherwise. Now, it is 2/2/25, and as a  proud 3rd generation American I refuse to underestimate this man or his idiotic supporters.

3,bbc_news,Center,44.73,-1.33,0.9803,-0.6422,"THE STORY ON TARIFFS
>According to recent reports it has been stated that the export volume to the United States of petroleum crude is expected to double over the next several years. That is a significant number. So, even if this figure does not double, any important increase in this export volume together with a high tariff wall, will hit the everyday American hard and American businesses, too. 
>No country consumes as much oil as the United States, and Canada ranks in the top four in the world with its resource of confirmed oil reserves. The United States consumes more oil per day than the combined total of the next three countries, China, India and Japan. There is no more secure source of this vital resource than in the province of Alberta, Canada. 
>American refineries, as this writer understands the technology, were designed specifically to refine the type of crude that comes from Canada. The volume of crude coming from Canada into the United States is over four million barrels per day and this represents twenty to twenty-five percent, roughly, of the daily consumption rate in the US which is itself over twenty million barrels per day! Any tariffs by the Trump administration will hit hard and will hit immediately. 
>With regard to potash, Canada has a huge resource of this commodity. This potash is a secure source unlike some of the other sources. Canada produces 16 million tons per year, which is more than Russia, China and Belarus combined. So, where would the US prefer to source its potash? Add this to the enormous export of crude to the US and one can see how this imposition of a tariff would have a serious impact on the US everyday citizens, and especially in the agricultural sector. Commentators in the US present the notion that the US can absorb the tariffs on these exports to the US; however, every time an American citizen goes to the gas station or goes to the grocery store, they will see the true cost of these two tariffs immediately.
>Now, we have had trade disputes before between Canada and the US, but these were resolved through negotiations. All that crude being shipped to the US each day is heavily discounted. When analyzing the trade in crude it could very well be that Canada is 'subsidizing' the US. We here in North America had better start looking at the big picture, and the world, as it is changing. Now is not the time to be threatening friends and allies."

3,bbc_news,Center,44.73,-1.33,0.9803,0.8207,"Just a note to people of the USA. What happens to the USA if Canada decides to completely cut off electricity/oil and rare earth metals to them?. Are they going to be building new hydro electric dams/mines/oil pipelines in the next year or five? because they cost HUGE money and take a very long time to build, and guess where all that money is coming from. There's a big reason why the USA is buying from Canada/Mexico and China, it's because they need them, because they can't supply themselves with the amounts of things they need. Canada, Mexico and China can and will (in quick time now) find other/new customers. While it may be painful in the short term it WILL BE happening, but what about the US?. They've effectively alienated and isolated themselves from most of the free world that were willing to supply/deal with them now, and in the future. Canada is the second largest country on earth with a small population but HUGE amounts of oil/water/electricity and rare earth minerals which most believe is the true reason Trump wants them to become the ""51st State"". The problem is, much of the USA's ""common folk"" don't understand how tariffs work. I believe this is going to be bad for everyone concerned ""the little people"", but more so for the US in the long term. The countries (their populations, which control the vote of their leaders) that they once relied on to supply them, will now be turning against them because they no longer trust them and will be be VERY reluctant about dealing with them in the future because of this after Trumps gone.

We humans are stupid when we let a businessman be a politician. 25 percent tariff?? In a year, you'll pay 10% more for every product.For example, let's take a washing machine, an American washing machine, a European washing machine, now each one is $2,000. After a 25% tariff, a European washing machine is $2,500. The difference is $500. What will the American washing machine manufacturer think?? If I raise the price of my washing machine by 3 percent, they will still buy mine. In three months, I will raise the price of my washing machine again by 6 percent. In the next three months, I will raise the price of my washing machine by another one percent. The difference will only be 15 percent between the prices of American washing machines and European washing machines. And this happens with every single  statement will be easy to prove if you see a product that comes from Europe and the same product is made in America. Will there be a 25 percent difference between the prices of the two products? If there is no 25 percent difference, then I was right.this policy is called hidden taxation,
which shouldn't be called a tax.
and the american people ate it up.only business circles benefit from this tariff policy and not people...just watch the price movements.."

3,bbc_news,Center,44.73,-1.33,0.9803,-0.9468,"I think the tariff on oil may actually only negatively affect US consumers. Based on some guesswork but more than likely correct imo. 
1) I assume that US refineries would have long term offtake agreements with the oil producers.
2) these contracts will be priced in $US/bbl. with the price based on international marker crudes 
3) excise duties (tariffs), pipeline charges etc. will be payable by the importer.
Under the above scenario, the exporter (Canada) is going to get the same amount in $US after the tariff as they did before but the importer will pay more for each bbl.
There is not much wriggle room for the importer as they need heavy crude which Canada is supplying and they probably don't have the infrastructure to import another heavy crude from elsewhere in the world. Similarly the exporter probably cannot pivot to selling their crude into another market due to lack of infrastructure. Given long enough both parties could develop the necessary infrastructure. 
It gets better for the exporter because the US dollar has formed (it always does in times of uncertainty) and the Canadian dollar has dropped significantly. So their revenue when converted to Canadian dollars has increased but their costs have remained the same."

This is my way of taking a stand against policies that hurt our neighbors and partners.
But some have asked: What about the Super Bowl?

Here’s my stance: I will watch the game, but I will do so at a local Mexican-owned bar in Playa del Carmen, where my money directly benefits hardworking Mexican people—NOT American corporations. The bar owner, servers, and cooks are not responsible for U.S. government actions, and they don’t deserve to be caught in the crossfire of a boycott.

To stay true to my commitment:

 I will not buy American-branded products—only local or non-U.S. options.
 I will use this moment to spread awareness and encourage discussion.
 I may donate an equal amount to a cause that fights economic injustice in Mexico and Canada.

Boycotts are personal choices, and I respect that others may see things differently. But I encourage everyone to think critically about where their money goes and what kind of world they want to support."

Here are some key solutions:

 A Fair and Accessible Immigration Reform
The immigration system should be clearer and more humane, providing a real path to citizenship for those who have already built their lives in the U.S. It’s also crucial to offer more legal work and residency opportunities to reduce irregular immigration, while ensuring border security without separating families.

 Protecting Immigrants’ Rights
No matter where you come from or your immigration status—everyone deserves to be treated with dignity. It’s essential to eliminate discrimination, guarantee access to education, healthcare, and housing, and oversee immigration agencies to prevent abuses.

 Supporting Home Countries
Many people migrate out of necessity, not choice. If the U.S. invests in the development of home countries—creating jobs, education, and stability—fewer people will be forced to leave their homes in search of better opportunities.

 A Cultural and Political Shift in the U.S.
To ensure immigrants are valued, society must be educated about their positive contributions. This means launching awareness campaigns, encouraging community integration, and supporting leaders who advocate for social justice.

 International Cooperation for a Better Future
The immigration issue is not just a U.S. problem—it’s global. Countries must work together to create solutions that benefit everyone, protect migrants' rights, and promote safe and orderly migration.

 Conclusion
If we act with humanity and commitment, we can transform the immigration system into one that is fair and equitable. Immigration is not a threat—it’s an opportunity to strengthen society and the economy. It’s time to recognize the value of every person, no matter where they come from. "

This should drive down the Canadian price of meat and grain products (including bread and cereals). In addition, Canada's greenhouse produce should be much cheaper. So when Canada's food prices start rise blame Trudeau's misguided counter tariffs on American farm produce. 

What we can all expect is that unemployment in the private sector will rise to 20%, our economy will contract into a depression as Canadian manufacturers permanently go out of business, and Justin and Dougie (two peas in a pod) will borrow $200+ billion to pay people to stay home from work and corporate welfare.

1,bloomberg,Lean Left,42.11,-3.16,-0.9962,-0.919,">The United States used to be a manufacturing country. Since the end of the Second World War this changed from a manufacturing center to a consumer center. All governments since the end of that conflict have been increasing the national debt, all of which has devalued the US dollar to the point where, today, a US dollar is worth about three cents, yes three cents, compared with a 1971 US dollar. So, today all the consuming US public is consuming with devalued dollars, hence, the increase in the sticker price of all goods and services. We simply need more of these devalued dollars to buy anything.
>The plan by the current US government to install these tariffs is a distraction from the real problem which is the US debt and the devalued US dollar. Currently, the US debt to GDP ratio is well over 100% and so the only way to get this ratio down is either to pay down the debt or to increase the productivity of the nation. The former is out of the question; the second option will take maybe twenty to thirty years. The latter is not unrealistic since it really took over forty years to create this problem in the first place. 
>With regard to the stated deficit in trade with Canada this is a complete falsehood. If one were to include services as well as goods, then the deficit would be dramatically altered. In addition, the US imports over four million barrels of oil each day. This oil is shipped at deep discounts which allows the US refineries to sell the finished product on the open market generating huge profits. The statements by the US President are misleading, incomplete and false. We are living in dangerous times. The last thing a leader ought to be doing is turning on its trusted and reliable ally. He will pay for this and so will the American people. Just wait until they go the grocery store or the gas station.
>This whole charade will not end well. Canada should immediately reform the inter-provincial trade barriers and should continue to forge new alliances around the world, including with China, India and the other BRICS nations. The US is in decline. The Americans do not appreciate what we, Canada, represent. Once the trust is broken it will never be restored. Canada should turn away from the whole misconception that the US is our friend and ally. 
It is not!

And customers have no better alternative. Also the “tariffs” will be paid by the Final consumer as the cost is PASSED ON to them. Do you really think the manufacturer or producer will pay for the tariffs? It’s the importer who pays and then adds that amount to the price of the goods.

Choose a product like Jack Daniels for example, from a Trump friendly state, and completely embargo that product. Coordinate with other countries to target specific products and shut them down one by one. That would hurt. Also, tariffs are used to try to cause people to stop buying products outside of their country and make it less expensive (comparably) to buy from within. Look at the labor force available in the US. It's pretty low and soon to get lower. That means companies will have to pay more to draw workers away and other companies will have to pay more to retain workers. This causes inflation within a country, which is how we got where we are now. Break the cycle and use the embargo instead. At least take a vote and let the people decide."

3,bloomberg,Lean Left,42.11,-3.16,0.9854,-0.8686,">Keep the following in mind. These tariffs are an expensive distraction. The real problem is the US national debt. In the year 2000 the debt stood at $5.0 Trillion US but now it stands at over $36.0 Trillion US. In four years, that debt will zoom over $40.0 Trillion US. With the hidden cost of the tariff move that debt could easily hit $44.0 Trillion US in four years.
>The only way to slow and then reverse that climb in debt is to grow the economy, increasing the GDP faster than the increases in the debt. The ratio of Debt/GDP is around 125 % and the only way to get this down below 100% is by increasing the GDP. These tariffs will do the opposite. Turning against the two allies, Canada and Mexico, will just accelerate the rise in debt while diminishing the rise in GDP of the US.

A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run."

1,cnn,Lean Left,42.13,-6.18,0.9072,0.7643,"People believe Donald Trump for a variety of reasons, and their support is often based on psychological, political, and social factors rather than just factual accuracy. Here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:

1. Tribalism & Political Identity
 • Many Americans strongly identify with their political party, and Trump has become the dominant figure in the Republican Party. People often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.
 • Once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.

2. Confirmation Bias
 • People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.
 • Supporters often rely on conservative media sources (Fox News, Newsmax, Breitbart), which reinforce Trump’s narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.

3. Charismatic & Populist Messaging
 • Trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.
 • His simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.

4. Mistrust of Traditional Media & Institutions
 • Trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them “fake news.” This creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.
 • Many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe Trump over the media or experts.

5. Emotional Appeal & Fear-Based Messaging
 • Trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.
 • When people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader—even if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.

6. Economic & Cultural Factors
 • Many supporters feel that Trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don’t fully support it.
 • Others see him as defending traditional American values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice movements).

7. Repetition & Social Influence
 • Trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.
 • If a person’s friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.

Bottom Line:

People believe Trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. Once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts."

So Companies really don't lose any money, we the people will be ones having less and less buying power since our dubgets will cover the company owners' expenses. Just like a regular war, the powerful ones create the conflict, and the regular people, who sometimes don't agree or don't understand the conflict, are the ones sent to stop bullets with the chest while the rich ones are safe in the comfortable places enjoying life to the max just trying to figure out how to decieve people to make them fight for them."

By incentivizing domestic production and reducing the trade deficit, his approach ensures long-term price stability, job creation, and national resilience, mitigating the impact of retaliatory measures. In the end, this policy is a strategic investment in economic self-sufficiency, industrial dominance, and enduring American prosperity."

We have to make very hard life changing adjustments but by requiring people on Medicaid younger than 55 to work at least 20 hours a week to maintain their Medicaid benefits it's a start in that direction. I will agree the president will have to step in & put freezing or limitation on inflation cost price increases for consumers w/ these USA companies.  EVERYONE will need to make sacrifices. We will need to hire these other countries management to train us to hire work quality & efficiency standards. He is trying to get American people back to work by trying our old or new for this generation market niches. Opening more farms to produce our fruits, vegetables, meats, etc. reopen the steel mills in West Virginia, expand and resurrect Auto industry in Detroit. Have new manufacturing for auto & all parts, clothing across USA. So, we now rely on other countries resources then we are at their mercy, thus, we have to answer to them whenever something goes wrong in the world. The last 1.5 generations are trained to work at home, on a computer: not hard labor w/ a honest day's pay. We do have to have checks and balances like labor unions to make sure workers are treated fairly.  I can see a vision to be self-sufficient USA so we can have that leverage as a leader in this world, but we have to make life changes in USA!!!

Once you don't have any dependents they are our dependents because they still take taxes every week and give you a little tax check that will pay a bill! Ridiculous! Then raise the cost on everything! But wonder why some people don't want to work! Why would they!

But the reality is that Canada has a very favorable geopolitical location that the U.S. can't really do anything about. That land, including the Arctic land masses, are now and will always be important to the United States for 3 reasons:

1. The Northwest Passage: With melting Arctic ice, a commercially important trade route will open and that will be very valuable to control. The north's answer to the Panama Canal. Currently it's controlled by Canada. 
2. Resources: oil, natural gas, metals and minerals of technological, commercial and military value, FRESH WATER...including undiscovered reserves in the Arctic 
3. The land could always become an adversary's military staging ground, particularly China and Russia, as they could easily come over the Arctic circle. 

So really the U.S. is protecting it's own interests by ""protecting"" Canada and will provide protection to that land no matter who lives there. They just don't want to live in a relatively frozen and desolate climate while they do their ""protecting"". Otherwise they would.

A Few Caveats
Complex Supply Chains:
Many products sold in the U.S. are assembled from components that may come from several countries. Even if a significant portion is imported from Mexico or Canada, only that portion might be affected by the tariff.

Price Absorption:
Manufacturers and retailers sometimes absorb part of a tariff (or adjust production) so that the full increase isn’t passed directly to consumers.

Market Factors:
Competition, brand positioning, and alternative sourcing might reduce or delay any direct price increases.

Estimates:
The prices listed above are illustrative examples based on current average prices. Actual price changes would depend on numerous factors including production costs, supply‐chain adjustments, and market conditions.

In Summary
If an everyday item that costs $X now is entirely imported from Mexico or Canada and faces a 25‑percent tariff, its price might be expected to rise to about $1.25×X. The examples above—from cars to a 6‑pack of beer or a gallon of milk—offer one way to visualize that impact.

Keep in mind these numbers are rough estimates intended to illustrate the potential effect of such a tariff on consumer prices."

I dont suppose Americans really have a way to know what is taking place right now north of the border at the ground level. Everywhere I go here in our city, all I hear from people is - what can I replace in my purchases both long and short term with some product other than American. Literally dozens of people we know, have cancelled their travel plans in the USA. We have taken 14 assorted cruises in the Caribbean and USA. Every one of them had stops in or originated in the USA. That is over, we will now travel in Europe or the far east. This really has Canadians upset and mobilizing to avoid spending money as much as they can in USA. Personally, I feel Florida, Mr Trumps home state will be one of the hardest hit areas over this - not only from Canadians, but from Mexico and other countries who holiday there as well. Sorry Americans, I wish it didnt have to be this way but we cant just sit and take it. And if we do act in the proper responsible way, seeking out suppliers from other countries - and actively, for the first time in decades, seeking markets in other countries than US, what Americans may give up in a trade war in the way of our resource rich raw materials, and in markets for their goods, once we find alternatives, you will likely lose forever."

Where were these politicians for last 2 years when grocery chains, banks, auto makers etc were price gouging us and increasing their profits? They raised the bogey of supply chain issues, never allowed outside chains to come in and held us ordinary Canadians hostage. Inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. Where did excess money come from? Only immigration? Grocery chains and alcohol producers made big profits without allowing inter provincial movement of goods, while we struggled with taxes, food and rent, so really who cares about  tariffs? Trump will force us to allow foreign companies to come here, excess internal supply will be diverted to us, hence less money will chase more goods, hopefully driving down prices.  The main downside is loss of jobs but companies were anyways silently laying off people last year under the radar so that will continue.

The answers are simple to me. It’s because he HAS to fix inflation for one, and two he’s determined to place tariffs. Unfortunately the two don’t mix…Not to mention….he will want to get elected for a third term. So, he has to do the tariffs now so that it he has time rebound and to try fixing inflation before “re-election”. This way he still gets all 3. He gets his tariffs, he gets his “I fixed it moment, and then his cult re-elects him a third term…

The other possible plan b is, that he keeps doing these new laws and making changes until the left breaks out in violence. He then declares marshal law, squashes the rebellion/violence and then he suspends constitution. Boom, he’s a full blown dictator. 

These are my worst case scenarios essentially."

1,forbes,Center,41.06,-3.87,0.8273,-0.8979,Actually the tariffs on products sold to Canada will cause pricing for same said products to be cheaper in the U.S. for U.S. citizens and here is why?   Canada is immediately threatening to cut back on buying or boycotting some to many of the products that will have tariffs put on them by the U.S.  This will increase the surplus of those products in the U.S. and in order for the companies to quickly sell or even sell them at the normal rate of speed those companies products will have to be reduced in price for U.S. buyers.   Basic law of supply and demand.  In effect for every product that is boycotted by Canada creates a surplus of that product in the U.S. making that product lower in cost for U.S. consumers and/or businesses.  So while the selling company may lose some money until they find other markets for their product where their product is not tariffed.  As far as the products that Canada wants to sell to the U.S. that they will be slapping tariffs on for the most part will not sell in the U.S. for the simple reason that we do in reality have an abundance of those minerals and the products that they are offering to us.  The exception to this is oil unless Trump has worked out a way to make up for the oil that we normally buy from Canada which is entirely possible.

Prior to this period of time the US trade deficit was closer to zero. Reason for the Trade deficit being $40 Billion was the relative large world price oil / gas last 3 to 4 years. Lastly, subtracting trade of oil and gas, US would have a large trade SURPLUS with Canada.

Trump has also played on words. If I buy an apple off my neighbour, I am not 'subsidizing' or being  'abusing' my neighbour. If I buy 2 apples off my neighbour, I am not greatly 'subsidizing' or  being greatly 'abused' by my neighbour. Given the logic /rhetoric I wonder what just stealing an apple off a neighbor means?? Ie if you steal an apple, I guess at least you would know that you weren't being abused by your neighbour. 

Trump has other goals , reasons for imposing tariffs, okay fine perhaps, but Trump and his followers should lay off the misleading rhetoric: the overall trade numbers and the choice of words/language."

Subject: Currency Exchange Policy in Response to U.S. Tariffs

Dear Valued American Customers,

Due to the unfair 25% tariffs imposed by  U.S. President Donald Trump on Canadian goods, businesses across Canada will now only accept U.S. currency at par. This means that $1 USD will be treated as $1 CAD, regardless of exchange rates.

While Canada has long welcomed American visitors with favorable exchange rates, these tariffs have placed an undue burden on our economy and businesses. In response, we are aligning our currency policies accordingly.

We appreciate your understanding and continued patronage, and we encourage you to use Canadian currency or credit/debit cards for transactions to ensure clarity in pricing.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
 Canada"

The economic relationship between the United States and the European Union is one of the most significant globally, encompassing trade in goods and services, as well as substantial investment flows.

Trade in Goods and Services:
Goods: In 2022, the U.S. exported goods worth approximately $351 billion to the EU, with leading markets including the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium. 

Services: The same year, U.S. services exports to the EU totaled around $241 billion, resulting in a services trade surplus of $71 billion. Key sectors included intellectual property, professional and management services, and financial services. 

Investment Income:
Beyond direct trade, U.S. companies earn significant income through their affiliates operating in Europe. In 2022, U.S. company affiliates in Europe earned an estimated $325 billion, marking a record high. 

In summary, the United States derives substantial economic benefits from its commercial interactions with the European Union, encompassing trade in goods and services, as well as income from investments."

2,forbes,Center,41.06,-3.87,0.7436,0.9914,"By strategically applying tariffs alongside policies that drive domestic industry efficiency and investment, America will achieve economic growth while eliminating cost burdens on consumers. Tariffs will protect domestic manufacturers, enabling them to scale production, innovate, and reduce costs through economies of scale. As industries expand, job creation will strengthen the labor market, increase wages, and boost consumer spending, reinforcing economic prosperity. Foreign exporters will lower prices or absorb tariff costs to maintain market share, preventing price hikes. Reduced reliance on imports will secure national self-sufficiency, shielding America from global supply disruptions and trade imbalances. A stronger U.S. dollar or foreign currency devaluation will offset tariff costs, ensuring affordability. Strategic tax breaks and investment incentives will further enhance efficiency and drive long-term growth. With these measures in place, tariffs will fortify America’s economy, creating jobs, fostering industrial expansion, and securing a stable and prosperous future without increasing consumer costs.

But, then again, does Trump care about the people who have to pay more?
If even retaliatory tariffs cancel each other, why does Trump feel the need to bully countries with tariffs. Could it be that Trump is counting on using the tariffs revenue that “we the people” will be paying to cover the tax breaks he’s giving his rich friends/corporations? Trump is on record saying “tariffs will pay to lower taxes”. 
I realize that Trump’s supporters don’t have the mental capacity to know that that’s what is happening.

3,forbes,Center,41.06,-3.87,0.975,0.8394,"One of the things that runs counterintuitively is the use of tariffs and how they can improve market efficiency. We are generally taught that tariffs increase costs. Consequently, if one side imposes a tariff, the other side should avoid it altogether. Maybe not. Reciprocal tariffs can encourage equity and, in the long run, lead to a reduction of tariffs altogether.

For example, if I make Product A less well than you and need tariffs to protect my market share, I am overall depriving my society of a better/cheaper version of Product A. If my government protects me via tariffs, the government is essentially abetting this deprivation. A reciprocal tariff can encourage open competition by putting a cost on this undesirable behavior."
3,forbes,Center,41.06,-3.87,0.975,0.0,"Tariffs are not the only means of trade distortion.  For example:  When Japan exports cars to the US, the US will test and certify the class as meeting US standards.  When the US ships cars to Japan, each individual car has to be tested so that it meets Japan's standards.  This adds approximately $10,000 to each vehicle. I could be even more now because I am citing old data."

Yes, prices went down during Smoot-Hawley, but that was because demand collapsed and unemployment hit 25% - not a good thing!

Also of course no one wants to lend you money for anything because it might end up cheaper tomorrow so that's higher risk and if they lend you anything it will be with a steep interest rate premium.

Plus, it dramatically decreased the amount of exported goods contributing to bank failures; particularly in agriculture-strong regions of the time.

When pointing out deflation occur during the 1930s, he's basically making a conclusion that it was due to tariffs. No, deflation occurred during the 1930s because of the collapse of our banking system which led to extreme decline in money supply.

I like how the FOX News graphics department included from various sources arntion of the Great Depression, but Charles Payne only referred to the time period as the '30's. Plus he uses roughly 30 seconds of the entire segment quoting Thucydides to say more or less that he is going to tell you the complete truth which is, well.... wait for it... far from the truth.

1,fox_news,Right,24.83,18.5,0.9864,-0.9586,"That is not the whole truth. What about the great depression?

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is widely considered a major policy mistake that deepened the Great Depression.  By significantly raising tariffs on thousands of goods, it triggered retaliatory tariffs from other nations. This drastically reduced international trade, crippling American exports and shrinking markets for U.S. businesses.  The decreased demand for American goods led to factory closures, job losses, and further economic decline.  While other factors contributed to the Depression, the tariff wars initiated by Smoot-Hawley worsened the economic downturn and made global recovery much more difficult."

1,fox_news,Right,24.83,18.5,0.9864,-0.9567,"The deflation of the 1930s that's casually glossed over here was due to the unprecedented wave of bank failures and the wiping out of deposits, thereby reducing the amount of money in circulation.

So it wasn’t just a low level of inflation (which, if kept within a certain range, is manageable); it was full-blown ""deflation"" (negative inflation), which is an entirely different beast that depending on its severity, can be downright catastrophic.

And to make matters worse, the US Federal Reserve, rather than increasing liquidity and expanding the money supply, responded by tightening monetary policy, triggering a loss of confidence as people hoarded cash instead of spending or depositing it, further restricting money circulation.

So in reality!!! the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 which jacked up U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, was not a good thing. In fact it's been acknowledged by practically every serious economic historian as being the single most disastrous policy blunder in US history, which ended up pouring fuel on the already-burning wreckage of the Great Depression.

The primary reason? Beyond the obvious inflationary squeeze of higher domestic prices, these tariffs provoked immediate and brutal retaliation from other nations! The result was that Americans got slapped with higher costs on not just their imports, but on their exports as well, in addition to having to deal with the spectacular collapse of most international trade.

And the world’s economy suffocated as most US domestic investors along with all foreign venture capital crap-shoot speculators vanished into thin air. And this choked the domestic and international money supply, which intensified the crushing deflation that defined the 1930s.

Any historian that knows anything about economics and has at least half a brain, will tell you that the Smoot-Hawley Act was protectionism at its most self-destructive. It was a policy disaster of epic proportions that made a terrible situation catastrophically worse.

And this Fox News clown and Trump economist is suggesting that these Tarrifs were the best thing America ever did since the invention of the light bulb. And furthermore, that everyone apart from him is simply too ignorant to realise this, because of course he's read a quote in a history book by Thucydides. God bless the liberal arts curriculum. 

Yes indeed, you really do have to admire Charles Payne for starting off his analysis by quoting Thucydides from his history of the Peloponnesian War: ""Most people in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth from politically unbiased, serious economic historians, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear from some two-bit Fox News shock-jock business analyst, who doesn't know the first thing about economics."""

chatGPT: William McKinley was a strong advocate for protective tariffs, and his policies—particularly the McKinley Tariff of 1890 and later the Dingley Tariff of 1897—had significant economic and social impacts on daily life in the U.S.:
...
Political & Social Reactions
    Increased Cost of Living Led to Backlash: The rise in consumer prices angered many, contributing to a Republican loss in the 1890 elections.
    1893 Panic & Economic Downturn: Though not solely caused by tariffs, the economic strain, along with bank failures and high unemployment, intensified criticism of protectionist policies.
    1896 Election & Tariff Adjustments: When McKinley became president, he introduced the Dingley Tariff, further increasing protection for industries but reinforcing high consumer costs.

Long-Term Impact
    McKinley’s tariffs shaped future trade policies, setting the stage for ongoing debates about free trade vs. protectionism.
    They contributed to the economic divide between industrialists (who benefited) and farmers/laborers (who struggled with higher costs and trade restrictions)."

Economic Assumptions: Estimates depend on certain economic assumptions which may not be accurate.

Consumer Behavior: Assumes consumers will continue to buy the same goods at higher prices without adjusting behavior.

Short-Term vs. Long-Term Impact: Focuses on short-term effects, ignoring potential long-term benefits.

If for some reason you need to buy that Canadian syrup or buy that avocado well then buy it knowing that it will be expensive and might help you in asking “where can we look for cheaper alternatives”. Buy shifting preferences you’ll also tell Canada and Mexico that they better change their economic practices because then the USA market will then no longer demand as much product out of them and other countries may or may not take in that extra products then forcing them to lobby their government which is what trump is counting on. They depend on American consumers in buying their products. We can save by not buying from them while they will definitely loose if we buy them or not either way. There’s no need to spend 2-3 dollars more on Canadian syrup or .75 to 1.15 extra on just one avocado if you don’t want to"

Tariffs are a source of revenue for the government and a consumption tax. Those making the laws will pay 1-3% and we the people will pay the rest.  Those in power are pushing the tax burden squarely onto the back of we the people and away from themselves.

 I could be mistaken, but this seems like a way to increase taxes without actually increasing the usual taxes such as income tax. Because the government needs more money, but saying that taxes are going up would mean the end of anyone's political career. 

So you increase tariffs and keep other taxes the same. Or even cut taxes. The people are happy because they don't understand the impact to them.

Only thing I'm not sure about is how much of a difference they make to people compared to just raising taxes.

Also just my personal opinion, but at least they can be used in negotiation with other countries. Instead of just raising taxes on your own people with no other benefit.

Unless the product you're imposing the tariff on has just one supplier with a complete monopoly, then the market should keep prices in control. I think. Tbh probably not."

1,nbc_news,Lean Left,42.78,-5.61,0.8116,-0.5255,"An economics degree is helpful, but not necessary to figure this out. Basic math and common sense is all it takes.

Economic efficiency is achieved when a product or service is produced or rendered at the lowest possible cost.

Examples:

It is much cheaper to grow oranges outdoors in tropical Florida than in Massachusetts' expensive greenhouses. This is due to Florida's favorable growing conditions, lower labor costs, and cost of living. So, we buy oranges from Florida.

The U.S. can import bamboo from Asia much more cheaply than it could be produced domestically, due to better growing conditions and cheap labor. So, we buy bamboo from Asia.

This forms the basis of trade.

The U.S. is currently importing billions more of these countries' products than it is exporting, creating a trade deficit and 8n some cases, violating trade agreements.

By imposing these tariffs, the price of THEIR goods will rise, not ours, which could spur a resurgence of U.S.-made goods and U.S.-grown food, potentially getting more Americans back to work.

Any retaliatory tariffs from these countries would hurt them much more than us, given the massive trade deficits.

Of course, to combat these tariffs, Canada, China, and Mexico COULD also move some manufacturing plants and jobs to (or back to) the U.S. and use U.S. workers. That would work!

Trump has an economics degree. Most of us don’t, but those of us who have mastered basic arithmetic and have badic common sense can figure out what he’s doing."

Trump said he was stopping ALL FOREIGN AID TO ANYONE, in order to make AMERICANS FIRST.
Yet he's pulling the carpet out from people who often have to choose between MEDICATIONS or FOOD, because they don't have enough money for both!
And Medicare isn't free, btw! it's hundreds of dollars a month simply in basic charges and fees, and it doesn't cover everything!!! A senior or disabled person, will either pay an average of $500 a month OR they will be subsidized because they are lower income. Subsidized with programs thru Medicaid!"

Tariffs do buy time for the weaker, noncompetitive industries to catch up, providing some breathing space. But it should never be used as a ""fix-all"" snake oil. In fact, I would regard tariffs as ""band-aid"". It provides temporary relief, it shields the wound from sight, but it won't cure the wound. It covers up the wound to keep away the unwanted elements such as bacteria and dust, but that is all. 

The US industries are overly dependent on tariffs for their survival. Politicians who come and go at a regular 4 year interval, are dying for votes to get in the White House. So buying votes is not beyond them, and tariffs is just the perfect tool to do that. What the politicians are doing is to kick the can of ""very things to do"" further down the track, for the successive administration. Biden got the can from Trump, and now Trump is holding that can, and is doing the same. Not only is Trump creating more tariffs, he is also making enemies out of allies namely Canada and Mexico.

US mills were protected, but the higher prices hurt steel buyers like car makers, economist estimate that the Tariffs created 1000 jobs in steel but cost 75,000 jobs among us companies overall” 

This is extremely misleading. Let’s break it down when you implement a tariff you are completely changing the supply chain.  So what happens? The people working in imports lose there job and have to change their direction. The wholesaler has to change and cuts out another middle man, the port in which it was being shipped through changes and on and on. So people lost there job yes but there is a shift in where the jobs are actually coming from. The other part “prices rose” well when you have 30% of all steel imported and are undermining the us manufacturers workers and wages and then add a tariff that creates a shortage or increases cost because it then takes time for hose company’s to bring their manufacturing back to the US and once in the US they then can compete on a level playing field in which would bring prices back down through competition. However we know prices won’t go down cause everything will only go up but it will grow the economy faster. 

And finally the big one. “Buyers like car makers and the loss of 75,000 jobs overall” well I hate to burst the bubble on this but when he implemented those tariffs it was March 2018 and showed signs of slow but steady growth and then a little thing call Covid happened and assembly lines stopped. 

To get this monkey off the American back we have to cut the cord to china and other countries that drag us down. The manufacturing jobs didn’t disappear over night in this country. US politicians let it happen over the past 40+years to pad their own pockets.

Trump is trying to get our country out from under the thumb of corrupt US politicians and government and out from under the control of horrible trade deals and make our economy rocket back by reducing spending (thank God for Elon Musk) and actually have a balanced budget and possibly a surplus so we can fund things like Medicaid and actually properly fund Social Security. To do all of this it takes significant out of the box thinking and strategy and you have to move fast because if you don’t people like these democrats that are watching their gravy train of USAID get gutted will be nothing but obstructionist and you only have 4 years. I haven’t seen politicians protest something like they are for USAID which is crazy because that money doesn’t go to the people they actually represent!"

Trump isn't talking about just targeting China or only applying limited tariffs on a specific sector that needs protected from foreign dumping.  He is talking about universal tariffs on all imports, even from our allies and countries that we have tried to boost economically as part of stopping illegal immigration.  2. It sickens me to hear this man who won't feel a bit of pain in his personal life from the disruption and high prices many of us will struggle with if he gets his way just shrug off the harm this will do to so many by saying we could just switch back in a decade if it doesn't work.

I suggest people read up on the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the early 20th century that led to the Great Depression. If he follows through on his plans, we could be looking at something very similar.

It's not that I completely disagree with the idea of relying less on China to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  But placing tariffs on ALL imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  INSTEAD of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from North, Central, and South America, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a US company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the U.S.  It would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  It would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the U.S. for work.    It would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the Panama Canal, because U.S. and Canadian imports from Mexico, C.A. and S.A. could come by train.  But Trump is the President now, so I guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve OUR (not just HIS) goals.  It would also ensure that those Central and S. American countries stay aligned with us instead of becoming more entwined with China.

1,sixty_minutes,Lean Left,34.19,-9.55,0.9965,0.9706,"Why Donald Trump's tariffs are not likely to bring Americans a durable benefit:

Eroding Trust Among Trade Partners: Tariffs create a rift between countries, making it harder to build strong, trusting relationships that are crucial for long-term economic growth.

Fueling Division and Tribalism: Instead of fostering unity, tariffs can deepen divisions, pitting groups against each other and creating a climate of hostility that can hinder cooperation.

Misallocation of Resources: The financial and human resources spent on implementing and managing tariffs could be better invested elsewhere, like innovation and infrastructure, which genuinely drive growth.

Driving Up Prices for Consumers: Tariffs often lead to higher costs for everyday products, making life a little tougher for families trying to make ends meet and pushing inflation in the wrong direction.

Empowering Authoritarian Regimes: By prioritizing tariffs over diplomacy, there's a risk of unintentionally bolstering authoritarian leaders who thrive on nationalistic sentiments, undermining global democratic values.

Promoting Short-Sighted Self-Interest: The focus on immediate gains can overshadow the need for sustainable practices, leaving a legacy of greed that prioritizes profit over people and planet."

We all know how Reagan's economic policy worked out for the middle class. Oh, it used to be that the average American family used to have at least one full-time employee in their family and even though there was just one main earner, most of those families could afford to pay their mortgages, buy school supplies and groceries, and buy the occasional car and take the occasional family vacation without having to sacrifice any regular stuff like medicine (they had health care back then). It was called the Middle Class. It was a pretty nifty thing for families until Ronald Reagan, yes, the actor, and, probably this buffoon here, Lighthizer, ideated that wealthy corporate owners could be given huge tax breaks to ""invest in their employees and business infrastructure"" and then pass the new financial windfalls they'd get and eventually got, down too the dedicated men and women who had those great, secure jobs that kept them in the Middle Class. They called it ""trickle down economics.

Maybe 300-500%... things like clothes and building materials, are still cheaper when manufactured outside America even at 100% tariff. Especially when the goods has labor cost is higher than the raw material cost. When an good that is sold at $100, where the labor is at $30, and material at $20, with $50 profit, but if you give it a 100% tax, it's now selling at $200 dollars, allowing you to take (in theory) $100 for every $30 paid to labor (in China or India) and for every $50 the manufacture profits... but still it's NOT going to bring those jobs back to United States, because the labor cost in USA would be at $150 to $300 just to make a $200-product, and the profitabiliy of something sold at $200 minus the labor $150 and material $20, would only be $30 profit, at 15% ($30/$200) profitability, it's not going to attract any business to move its base back into United States... 

Meanwhile, people who used to be able to buy stuff at $100, now would have to buy it at $200, or even at $300 for products made in USA... it would have a short-term pain for the average households, and a long term drop in trade. People who sells stuff at $100 to the United States, would now look for customers outside of United States selling at $100 to make up for the loss of revenue.

In the end, average consumers would either find cheaper tag price items at $50 for much inferior quality, or people could end-up buying from a trip to Mexico or Canada to buy item at 50% discount and bring them in as 'personal comsumption' to evade the import tax. If tariff is at 100%, demand for higher priced item would drop by 50%, and those who couldn't afford, would help jack up the price of much inferior item. Say if you used to buy natural cotton t-shirt at $20 a piece, which gives manufacture $10 for every t-shirt sold. Now it's selling at $40-dollar, and you'll end up buying a $20-dollar chemically-synthesized-fabric at cost of $2 where manufacturer would make $8 for every t-shirt sold, and the US government would take $10-dollar, allowing you to keep your cost down at $20 for t-shirt. the downside for you is that chemically-synthesized t-shirt would contain unhealthy substances and put a strain on US-health system, thereby increasing the insurance cost even further.

I'm not sure where the $10 dollar tax by government would go for every chemically-synthesized t-shirt sold at $20, but it's definitely not in the pockets of average consumers or health insurance of tax payers."

They leave their neighbor out on the road in need. Starbucks wint even let you use their bathroom anymore. How is that caring for community? 

Other countries don’t do this. They care about their people, & they make better deals because they demand it. They love their people more. American companies must learn to love their employees & communities more. CEOs aren't being taken advantage of, they are taking advantage & worshiping profits & greed. 

Glad this employer will go back into business & keep the community employed. Every country must look out for its people, not just its CEOs. 

The difference now than a few decades ago is too many CEOs care about raking in money, more than keeping good people employed. It is noble to take less money & have less profits if the money is going into communities. In the past, most CEOs did not care so much about money & profits & more about people & keeping a standard of living."

Explanation

    The Framers of the Constitution had experienced tyranny and trained militias. They understood that a citizen militia was necessary to resist a military that could become oppressive. 

Anti-Federalists believed that the centralized military established by the Constitutional Convention gave the federal government too much power. 
The Second Amendment codified the right of citizens to possess firearms to help resist a tyrannical government. 
The Second Amendment was also intended to keep military power under civil control."

2,wsj,Center,48.87,-0.27,0.9599,-0.5202,"No, President William McKinley did not abandon his tariff policy. He was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. As a Congressman, he was responsible for the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect American industries. Later, as president, he signed the Dingley Tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in U.S. history until the 1930s.

However, McKinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. He began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. This was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage U.S. exports.

Why Was McKinley Assassinated?
McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. Czolgosz believed that McKinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. Inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the Pan-American Exposition. The president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on September 14, 1901. His assassination led to Theodore Roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the Progressive Era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy."

2,wsj,Center,48.87,-0.27,0.9599,-0.4975,"As someone living in the Netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, I recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run."
2,wsj,Center,48.87,-0.27,0.9599,0.6048,"This is a great summation of everyone’s thoughts on tariffs. Sounds great in practice and then eventually you realize it’s not worth it and kind of dumb. 

I posted something on this exact thing and the rest of trump’s economic policies."
2,wsj,Center,48.87,-0.27,0.9599,0.9294,"The Wall Street Journal’s dismissal of Trump’s tariffs as “the dumbest trade war” ignores their strategic leverage in reshaping North American trade and security. Far from reckless protectionism, the policy has already pressured Mexico to deploy troops against fentanyl trafficking and incentivized trade shifts that align with U.S. interests. These tariffs are not just economic penalties but a calculated effort to force concessions on critical issues like immigration, drug enforcement, and manufacturing imbalances.

Beyond diplomacy, tariffs serve a broader goal—reducing U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains and reviving domestic industries. With 42% of auto parts sourced from Mexico, targeted tariffs encourage reshoring, strengthening states like Michigan and Ohio. Selective rates, such as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy versus 25% on other goods, further reveal a nuanced strategy protecting key sectors without fully severing trade ties. This push for economic sovereignty is a response to vulnerabilities exposed by global crises, ensuring long-term resilience over short-term economic discomfort.

Critics who champion free trade often ignore its failures, from stagnant wages to the U.S.’s $180 billion trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. Just as Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs led to USMCA negotiations that strengthened labor protections, these tariffs could force necessary reforms. Markets, too, have proven adaptable, with initial stock market dips stabilizing as businesses adjust.

Labeling this strategy as simply “dumb” oversimplifies a complex, high-stakes negotiation. The real question isn’t whether tariffs cause disruption—they always do—but whether that disruption secures lasting economic and security advantages. If it does, then the short-term pain is a price worth paying."

1. McKinley never ""abandoned"" tariffs. He negotiated with other countries and cut deals where it benefitted the US economy, especially in the wake of the Panic of 1893 and even his final proposal came only after the growth of competitive domestic industries ready for international competition. 

2. The US was running a surplus during McKinley's presidency, but we were not yet debt free. The last time we were debt free and running surpluses was in 1835 under Andrew Jackson. But that's beside the point. It would take a very long time to service our debt even with a modest surplus, and if we did begin to service the debt it would open up a greater portion of our government budget to spend on other things that benefit the public, or allow us to reduce taxes to moderate the surplus and strengthen the economy.

3. Any tariff policy would necessarily be results driven and rely on a more robust,  results driven plan to strengthen America's competitiveness by restoring domestic industry. Tariffs should of course be adjusted when appropriate. If tariffs are raised to protect and revive certain industries in the United States, we can expect prices to rise for a time before subsiding as we see production closer to our own market grow.

2,wsj,Center,48.87,-0.27,0.9599,-0.7987,"This is all true however I do think there is another side to this which for some reason everyone seems to be glossing over that trump does with tarrifs. Creating security (not depending on foreign adversaries for production) and using it as a major bargaining chip. The US has an interesting position as the worlds largest market of goods and so every country and their mother wants to import their goods there. We are also a heavy service based economy as opposed to production all of which is good and it helps when bargaining. If we threaten tariffs because we are a net importer countries will tend to lose any trade war they think about imposing or at the very least they'll be more hurt than the US consumer. This is why for example we saw trump threaten tariffs on Mexico and Canada. It was a strategy to get them to come to the table. The US cannot be the only country enforcing immigration and border policies and it worked. The other part of this is fairness. The US has close to no tariffs but many other countries in the world including the entire EU has loads of tarriffs on American goods and even services all while they don't pay the necessary fees to be in NATO so what does trump do? He threatens tariffs and talks it up making people think he is dead serious only for it to be a bargaining chip to force them to get a more fair deal. In this case he wants the EU to lessen their tariffs and open up more of their economies to US energy production to stop the reliance on Russia. China is self explanatory. They devalue their currency, steal patents, and use their government control to screw with American companies so using tariffs and forcing them to the table is also a good idea nevermind the fact its a major security risk to have almost all your military and domestic products reliant on a foreign adversary which is why the Biden administration and many foreign policy gurus and “experts” quietly supported it after trump left office."

2,wsj,Center,48.87,-0.27,0.9599,-0.9985,"What Happens When a Competitor’s Market Enters a Deflationary Spiral?
(Applying the VCEC Theory 2.0)

When a competing economy (e.g., China or the EU) enters a deflationary spiral, the following self-reinforcing cycle occurs:

1. Falling Prices Lead to Margin Collapse
Overproduction and weak demand force price cuts, but lower prices don’t stimulate new demand (especially for durable goods like cars or appliances).
Profit margins shrink, making it harder for businesses to cover costs.
Companies desperately cut costs, slash wages, and lay off workers, further reducing demand.
 Example:

Chinese EV makers slash prices, but demand remains stagnant.
Low margins force weaker companies into bankruptcy, and job losses weaken domestic consumption.

2. Capital Flight & Currency Depreciation
Investors pull capital out of the struggling economy to seek safer, higher-yield assets (often in U.S. markets).
The local currency weakens due to capital outflows and collapsing corporate earnings.
A weaker currency raises import costs, worsening profitability for businesses relying on foreign components.
 Example:

China experiences capital flight to USD assets, further weakening the yuan.
Higher import costs on essential goods (e.g., semiconductors, energy) increase financial strain.

3. The U.S. Economy Strengthens from the Spiral
Foreign capital flows into U.S. Treasuries, stocks, and real estate, strengthening the dollar.
A strong USD lowers U.S. import costs, reducing inflationary pressures.
U.S. consumers maintain spending power, while competitors suffer from currency weakness.
 Example:

The strong dollar makes imported goods (oil, semiconductors) cheaper for the U.S.
Tariffed goods become more expensive for the competitor but not for the U.S., as production shifts elsewhere (e.g., Mexico, Vietnam).

4. Trade War Intensifies: Tariffs & Market Fragmentation
The U.S. exploits the competitor’s weakness by increasing tariffs or restricting market access to slow their recovery.
A collapsing competitor’s market means excess supply floods into weaker economies, creating a race to the bottom in pricing.
Tariffs block competitors from dumping excess supply into high-margin Western markets, forcing them into low-profit secondary markets (Africa, Latin America).
 Example:

China’s EVs are hit with 100% tariffs in the U.S. and EU, forcing them to sell at near-zero margins in poorer markets.
U.S. and EU firms gain market share, while BYD and other Chinese firms face financial collapse before Tesla or Ford feel pressure.

5. Economic Collapse Triggers Political Instability
Widespread factory closures, job losses, and economic stagnation fuel internal unrest.
Government bailouts fail to restore growth, leading to long-term stagnation (Japan’s ""Lost Decades"" scenario).
Political leaders turn to protectionism, stimulus, or military posturing to distract from economic failure.
 Example:

China struggles to contain financial fallout from failing industries and introduces state bailouts, which only delay collapse.
Export-driven economies like Germany suffer as global demand weakens, triggering an EU economic crisis.

6. U.S. Firms Win the Long-Term Game (Innovation + Market Control)
The U.S. absorbs capital, talent, and investment, further expanding its tech and financial sector dominance.
Companies in AI, semiconductors, and autonomous vehicles accelerate their lead over struggling competitors.
Full self-driving technology, AI-driven supply chains, and automation create new economic moats that competitors cannot match.
 Example:

Tesla, Google (Waymo), and U.S. AI firms dominate self-driving and Edge AI, making low-cost EV production irrelevant.
China’s focus on cutting EV prices becomes obsolete as AI-driven vehicle networks reshape the auto market.
Final Outcome: The U.S. Turns the Competitor’s Crisis into a Self-Reinforcing Economic Advantage
 Deflation in a competitor’s market weakens their ability to compete globally.
 Capital flight strengthens the USD, lowering U.S. import costs and sustaining domestic consumption.
 Tariffs block competitor recovery, forcing them into financial ruin before U.S. firms feel pressure.
 Technological dominance (AI, self-driving) becomes the real economic battleground, rendering low-cost production irrelevant.

 Final Take: If China or another major competitor falls into a deflationary spiral, the U.S. absorbs global capital, strengthens the dollar, blocks economic recovery through tariffs, and advances AI dominance—cementing its long-term economic supremacy.

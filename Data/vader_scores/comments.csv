=====================

1) 我们中华民族是一个有着五千年文明历史的国家, 虽然我们在近代的两百年落后了, 但我们仍然要挺起脊梁!!! 完全没有必要因为需要发展经济, 而去迁就美国或是西方的任何无理而又霸道的行为! 无论外部环境的好坏, 我们发展经济以及提高科技实力都要靠我们自己, 而不是任何国家的恩惠!!!🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳

2) 中国与俄罗斯的友好关系的历史价值不仅仅在于当今的世界格局，更要从中国的几千年的大历史来看!!!

The HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE of the MUTUAL BENEFICIAL FRIENDSHIP between China and Russia lies NOT ONLY IN THE CONTEMPORARY GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS BUT ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS’ OUR CHINESE HISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY!!!
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺


衷心祝愿中国与俄罗斯的双边贸易能够在市场的原则下更上一层楼!!! 

I SINCERELY hope that under the principle of the Market Economy, the BILATERAL TRADE between China and Russia will CLIMB UP TO ANOTHER ALTITUDE!!!  

3) Both Chinese President Xi and Russian President Putin are GREAT contemporary world leaders! Under their leadership, both China and Russia will not only restore the past glories of our two countries respectively, BUT ALSO HAVE PERMANENT ECONOMIC PROSPERITIES AND BRIGHT FUTURES !!! 
🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺🇨🇳🇷🇺
 

4) 历史证明这些甘当美帝国主义走狗的人或国家绝不会有好下场!!!
The past thirty years’ history has demonstrated that those DEPRAVED THUGS AND TRAITORS who SHAMELESSLY WANT to be the RUNNING DOGS of American hegemony HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DOOMED INTO THE THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!

5) Taiwan has been part of China since 15th century! TAIWAN WILL REUNITE WITH THE MAINLAND CHINA IN THE NEAR FUTURE!!! NO COUNTRY on this planet can block this IRREVERSIBLE TREND OF HISTORY! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality WILL BE DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!! 

只有统一台湾，我们中华民族才能完全洗刷自鸦片战争以来的一百多年我们被西方列强所任意欺辱的历史!!!

REUNITING WITH TAIWAN IS THE LAST STEP FOR OUR CHINESE PEOPLE TO FINALLY GET RID OF THE STIGMA of the more than one hundred years’ decline of China since the Opium Wars!!!

南沙群岛以及周边水域自古以来就是中国领土的一部分! 强烈支持中国海警对南海水域的巡逻执法!!! 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳  

6)  历史终将会对冷战结束以后的这段历史进行审判! 那些挂羊头卖狗肉以上一届美国拜登政府为首的厚颜无耻的西方政治骗子们终将会遗臭万年!!!
In fact, THOSE SINISTER HYPOCRITICAL TOP OFFICIALS OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OF U.S GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS ITS ALLIES ARE THE VERY PERSONS WHO SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH COMMITTING THE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!!

7) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which has been the FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES of many EVILNESSES in the contemporary world since the end of Cold War!

a) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand always emphasizes its championing of the so called western values, and on the other hand is supporting Israel’s bombing of hospitals in Gaza right now!!!

b) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims that the U.S. is the beacon of the world, and on the other hand MAKE FORTUNE by promoting hatreds between countries or between different ethnic groups and then selling weapons to countries or ethnic groups in the conflicts!!!

c) IT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT which on one hand claims its support of market economy and free trade, and on the other hand keeps WHIMSICALLY suppressing and containing Chinese high-tech companies!!!

8)  美式民主= 劳民伤财+ 政治蠢货
American democracy = WASTING MONEY + POLITICAL MORONS  

️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️
G7 is EVIL7!!!

以美国为首的西方政治蠢货们还在做着两百多年前的西方霸权梦! 可惜现如今不是1924年!! 而是2024年!!! 应该看清现实的是欧洲的那些政治蠢货们!!! 欧洲的这些政治蠢货们越跟在美国的后面充当美国霸权的走狗, 这些国家就会变得越无足轻重!!!

IT IS THOSE DELUSIONAL WESTERN POLITICAL MORONS WHO NEED TO WAKE UP from their DAYDREAM of western hegemony!!! RIGHT NOW IT IS 2024 not 1924!!! Those DELUSIONAL European political MORONS should understand that THE MORE they follow the American HEGEMONIC policies, THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT THESE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL BECOME!!! 
️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️

9) 美国政府对中国的高科技产业的打压只会是搬起石头砸自己的脚!!!
All the efforts made by the  U.S. government to suppress and contain the development of Chinese high-tech industries will be FUTILE!!! 

NEITHER the United States NOR any other country on this planet can block the progress of People’s Republic of China!!! The U.S. government can ONLY BLOCK THE PROGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF!!! 

那些唱衰中国经济的人们, 到头来只会是唱衰了他们本国的经济!!!
Those people who are betting the decline of Chinese economy WILL ULTIMATELY FACE THE REALITY OF ECONOMIC DECLINE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY!!!

10) 世界的和平与繁荣发展需要的是多建设桥梁与铁路, 而不是在不同的种族, 宗教或不同的意识形态之间散播仇恨! 更不是以捍卫民主自由为名, 行战争贩子之实,以各种形式不断地卖武器, 大发战争的不义之财!!!

To achieve the LONG-TERM PEACE AND PROSPERITY, we need to BUILD MORE BRIDGES AND HIGH-SPEED RAILROADS around the world, NOT to spread hatreds between different ethnicities, religions or between different ideologies! Unfortunately, in the name of promoting democracy the U.S. government and its western allies are CONSTANTLY SELLING WEAPONS in various forms and SHAMELESSLY MAKE FORTUNES by sacrificing millions of innocent lives without any hesitation! 

11) The period of thirty years after the collapse of the former Soviet Union is NOT an equilibrium state, BUT A TRANSITIONAL STATE, during which the world experienced constant violences and wars! This uni-polar world dominated by American hegemony will be replaced by an EPOCH-MAKING multi-polar world, and NO ONE can block this IRREVERSIBLE historical trend! Those western hypocrites who are refusing to recognize the reality will be DOOMED INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY!!!  

12) The system of BRICS countries has become and will continue to be one of the most important polars in this BURGEONING MULTI-POLAR world!  

Warmly Welcome Indonesia 🇮🇩to become the FULL member of BRICS system.
Warmly welcome Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Algeria, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Vietnam, Venezuela, as well as other countries to apply for the membership of the BRICS system!

青山遮不住, 毕竟东流去！
历史发展的大趋势谁也无法阻挡!!!

It is the HEGEMONIC POWER of the U. S. which is DIMINISHING!!! 

13) By ARBITRARILY imposing economic sanctions against other countries, the U.S. government is DIGGING THE GRAVE for the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency of international trade!

14) People around the world should be UNITED TO FIGHT AGAINST American hegemony!
当今世界苦美国的霸权与霸道久矣!!!

>According to recent reports it has been stated that the export volume to the United States of petroleum crude is expected to double over the next several years. That is a significant number. So, even if this figure does not double, any important increase in this export volume together with a high tariff wall, will hit the everyday American hard and American businesses, too. 
>No country consumes as much oil as the United States, and Canada ranks in the top four in the world with its resource of confirmed oil reserves. The United States consumes more oil per day than the combined total of the next three countries, China, India and Japan. There is no more secure source of this vital resource than in the province of Alberta, Canada. 
>American refineries, as this writer understands the technology, were designed specifically to refine the type of crude that comes from Canada. The volume of crude coming from Canada into the United States is over four million barrels per day and this represents twenty to twenty-five percent, roughly, of the daily consumption rate in the US which is itself over twenty million barrels per day! Any tariffs by the Trump administration will hit hard and will hit immediately. 
>With regard to potash, Canada has a huge resource of this commodity. This potash is a secure source unlike some of the other sources. Canada produces 16 million tons per year, which is more than Russia, China and Belarus combined. So, where would the US prefer to source its potash? Add this to the enormous export of crude to the US and one can see how this imposition of a tariff would have a serious impact on the US everyday citizens, and especially in the agricultural sector. Commentators in the US present the notion that the US can absorb the tariffs on these exports to the US; however, every time an American citizen goes to the gas station or goes to the grocery store, they will see the true cost of these two tariffs immediately.
>Now, we have had trade disputes before between Canada and the US, but these were resolved through negotiations. All that crude being shipped to the US each day is heavily discounted. When analyzing the trade in crude it could very well be that Canada is 'subsidizing' the US. We here in North America had better start looking at the big picture, and the world, as it is changing.

1) I assume that US refineries would have long term offtake agreements with the oil producers.
2) these contracts will be priced in $US/bbl. with the price based on international marker crudes 
3) excise duties (tariffs), pipeline charges etc. will be payable by the importer.
Under the above scenario, the exporter (Canada) is going to get the same amount in $US after the tariff as they did before but the importer will pay more for each bbl.
There is not much wriggle room for the importer as they need heavy crude which Canada is supplying and they probably don't have the infrastructure to import another heavy crude from elsewhere in the world.

Here are some key solutions:

 A Fair and Accessible Immigration Reform
The immigration system should be clearer and more humane, providing a real path to citizenship for those who have already built their lives in the U.S. It’s also crucial to offer more legal work and residency opportunities to reduce irregular immigration, while ensuring border security without separating families.

 Protecting Immigrants’ Rights
No matter where you come from or your immigration status—everyone deserves to be treated with dignity. It’s essential to eliminate discrimination, guarantee access to education, healthcare, and housing, and oversee immigration agencies to prevent abuses.

 Supporting Home Countries
Many people migrate out of necessity, not choice. If the U.S. invests in the development of home countries—creating jobs, education, and stability—fewer people will be forced to leave their homes in search of better opportunities.

 A Cultural and Political Shift in the U.S.
To ensure immigrants are valued, society must be educated about their positive contributions. This means launching awareness campaigns, encouraging community integration, and supporting leaders who advocate for social justice.

 International Cooperation for a Better Future
The immigration issue is not just a U.S. problem—it’s global. Countries must work together to create solutions that benefit everyone, protect migrants' rights, and promote safe and orderly migration.

 Conclusion
If we act with humanity and commitment, we can transform the immigration system into one that is fair and equitable. Immigration is not a threat—it’s an opportunity to strengthen society and the economy. It’s time to recognize the value of every person, no matter where they come from.

The ratio of Debt/GDP is around 125 % and the only way to get this down below 100% is by increasing the GDP. These tariffs will do the opposite. Turning against the two allies, Canada and Mexico, will just accelerate the rise in debt while diminishing the rise in GDP of the US.
Does anyone in Washington not see this?
Thanks for reading. Please comment.",,">keep the following in mind. these tariffs are an expensive distraction. the real problem is the us national debt. in the year 2000 the debt stood at $5.0 trillion us but now it stands at over $36.0 trillion us. in four years, that debt will zoom over $40.0 trillion us. with the hidden cost of the tariff move that debt could easily hit $44.0 trillion us in four years. >the only way to slow and then reverse that climb in debt is to grow the economy, increasing the gdp faster than the increases in the debt. the ratio of debt/gdp is around 125 % and the only way to get this down below 100% is by increasing the gdp. these tariffs will do the opposite. turning against the two allies, canada and mexico, will just accelerate the rise in debt while diminishing the rise in gdp of the us. does anyone in washington not see this? thanks for reading. please comment."

A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. But from a purely American perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. While not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run.",,"as someone living in the netherlands and striving to observe global economic policies as objectively as possible, i recognize that economic situations vary over time and across regions, requiring different strategies. a policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.  looking at the u.s. today, it’s clear that something has to change. the country has an enormous gdp but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. the economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the american people. tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.  history shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. around 1900, the u.s. implemented high tariffs that forced european exporters to pay more for market access. the effect was twofold: it protected american industries while making european goods more expensive. now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. if the u.s. moves aggressively on tariffs again, europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the american market, and possible retaliatory measures.  some industries in the u.s. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. the automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. but history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the u.s. more leverage in trade negotiations.  the global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in u.s. policy will have ripple effects worldwide. but from a purely american perspective, tariffs seem like a necessary response to decades of offshoring and mounting debt. while not universally popular, they may be the right choice for securing economic resilience in the long run."

Here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:

1. Tribalism & Political Identity
 • Many Americans strongly identify with their political party, and Trump has become the dominant figure in the Republican Party. People often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.
 • Once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.

2. Confirmation Bias
 • People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.
 • Supporters often rely on conservative media sources (Fox News, Newsmax, Breitbart), which reinforce Trump’s narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.

3. Charismatic & Populist Messaging
 • Trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.
 • His simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.

4. Mistrust of Traditional Media & Institutions
 • Trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them “fake news.” This creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.
 • Many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe Trump over the media or experts.

5. Emotional Appeal & Fear-Based Messaging
 • Trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.
 • When people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader—even if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.

6. Economic & Cultural Factors
 • Many supporters feel that Trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don’t fully support it.
 • Others see him as defending traditional American values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice movements).

7. Repetition & Social Influence
 • Trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.
 • If a person’s friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.

Bottom Line:

People believe Trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. Once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts.",,"people believe donald trump for a variety of reasons, and their support is often based on psychological, political, and social factors rather than just factual accuracy. here are some key reasons why many people continue to trust and support him:  1. tribalism & political identity  • many americans strongly identify with their political party, and trump has become the dominant figure in the republican party. people often prioritize party loyalty over fact-checking.  • once someone is deeply committed to a leader or ideology, they are less likely to change their views, even when confronted with contradictory evidence.  2. confirmation bias  • people tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and dismiss evidence that contradicts their views.  • supporters often rely on conservative media sources (fox news, newsmax, breitbart), which reinforce trump’s narratives while discrediting opposing viewpoints.  3. charismatic & populist messaging  • trump presents himself as an outsider fighting against corrupt elites, which resonates with people who feel ignored by the political establishment.  • his simple, direct language and repetition of key phrases make his messages memorable and persuasive.  4. mistrust of traditional media & institutions  • trump consistently attacks mainstream media, calling them “fake news.” this creates doubt about fact-checkers and independent reporting.  • many of his supporters already mistrust government institutions, so they are more inclined to believe trump over the media or experts.  5. emotional appeal & fear-based messaging  • trump often uses fear-based rhetoric (e.g., crime, immigration, economic collapse) to create a sense of urgency and crisis.  • when people feel threatened, they are more likely to rally around a strong, authoritative leader—even if some of the threats are exaggerated or misleading.  6. economic & cultural factors  • many supporters feel that trump represents their economic interests (lower taxes, deregulation, job growth) even if the facts don’t fully support it.  • others see him as defending traditional american values against what they perceive as radical changes in society (e.g., immigration, lgbtq+ rights, racial justice movements).  7. repetition & social influence  • trump repeats false claims so often that they become ingrained in public discourse.  • if a person’s friends, family, and community believe something, they are more likely to believe it too.  bottom line:  people believe trump not necessarily because he is always truthful, but because he aligns with their worldview, appeals to their emotions, and reinforces their political and social identity. once people are invested in a belief system, changing their minds becomes very difficult, regardless of the facts."

A Few Caveats
Complex Supply Chains:
Many products sold in the U.S. are assembled from components that may come from several countries. Even if a significant portion is imported from Mexico or Canada, only that portion might be affected by the tariff.

Price Absorption:
Manufacturers and retailers sometimes absorb part of a tariff (or adjust production) so that the full increase isn’t passed directly to consumers.

Market Factors:
Competition, brand positioning, and alternative sourcing might reduce or delay any direct price increases.

Estimates:
The prices listed above are illustrative examples based on current average prices. Actual price changes would depend on numerous factors including production costs, supply‐chain adjustments, and market conditions.

In Summary
If an everyday item that costs $X now is entirely imported from Mexico or Canada and faces a 25‑percent tariff, its price might be expected to rise to about $1.25×X. The examples above—from cars to a 6‑pack of beer or a gallon of milk—offer one way to visualize that impact.

Dear Valued American Customers,

Due to the unfair 25% tariffs imposed by  U.S. President Donald Trump on Canadian goods, businesses across Canada will now only accept U.S. currency at par. This means that $1 USD will be treated as $1 CAD, regardless of exchange rates.

While Canada has long welcomed American visitors with favorable exchange rates, these tariffs have placed an undue burden on our economy and businesses. In response, we are aligning our currency policies accordingly.

We appreciate your understanding and continued patronage, and we encourage you to use Canadian currency or credit/debit cards for transactions to ensure clarity in pricing.

Thank you for your cooperation.

So it wasn’t just a low level of inflation (which, if kept within a certain range, is manageable); it was full-blown ""deflation"" (negative inflation), which is an entirely different beast that depending on its severity, can be downright catastrophic.

And to make matters worse, the US Federal Reserve, rather than increasing liquidity and expanding the money supply, responded by tightening monetary policy, triggering a loss of confidence as people hoarded cash instead of spending or depositing it, further restricting money circulation.

So in reality!!! the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 which jacked up U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, was not a good thing. In fact it's been acknowledged by practically every serious economic historian as being the single most disastrous policy blunder in US history, which ended up pouring fuel on the already-burning wreckage of the Great Depression.

The primary reason? Beyond the obvious inflationary squeeze of higher domestic prices, these tariffs provoked immediate and brutal retaliation from other nations! The result was that Americans got slapped with higher costs on not just their imports, but on their exports as well, in addition to having to deal with the spectacular collapse of most international trade.

And the world’s economy suffocated as most US domestic investors along with all foreign venture capital crap-shoot speculators vanished into thin air. And this choked the domestic and international money supply, which intensified the crushing deflation that defined the 1930s.

Any historian that knows anything about economics and has at least half a brain, will tell you that the Smoot-Hawley Act was protectionism at its most self-destructive. It was a policy disaster of epic proportions that made a terrible situation catastrophically worse.

And this Fox News clown and Trump economist is suggesting that these Tarrifs were the best thing America ever did since the invention of the light bulb. And furthermore, that everyone apart from him is simply too ignorant to realise this, because of course he's read a quote in a history book by Thucydides. God bless the liberal arts curriculum. 

Yes indeed, you really do have to admire Charles Payne for starting off his analysis by quoting Thucydides from his history of the Peloponnesian War: ""Most people in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth from politically unbiased, serious economic historians, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear from some two-bit Fox News shock-jock business analyst, who doesn't know the first thing about economics.""",,"the deflation of the 1930s that's casually glossed over here was due to the unprecedented wave of bank failures and the wiping out of deposits, thereby reducing the amount of money in circulation.  so it wasn’t just a low level of inflation (which, if kept within a certain range, is manageable); it was full-blown ""deflation"" (negative inflation), which is an entirely different beast that depending on its severity, can be downright catastrophic.  and to make matters worse, the us federal reserve, rather than increasing liquidity and expanding the money supply, responded by tightening monetary policy, triggering a loss of confidence as people hoarded cash instead of spending or depositing it, further restricting money circulation.  so in reality!!! the smoot-hawley tariff act of 1930 which jacked up u.s. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, was not a good thing. in fact it's been acknowledged by practically every serious economic historian as being the single most disastrous policy blunder in us history, which ended up pouring fuel on the already-burning wreckage of the great depression.  the primary reason? beyond the obvious inflationary squeeze of higher domestic prices, these tariffs provoked immediate and brutal retaliation from other nations! the result was that americans got slapped with higher costs on not just their imports, but on their exports as well, in addition to having to deal with the spectacular collapse of most international trade.  and the world’s economy suffocated as most us domestic investors along with all foreign venture capital crap-shoot speculators vanished into thin air. and this choked the domestic and international money supply, which intensified the crushing deflation that defined the 1930s.  any historian that knows anything about economics and has at least half a brain, will tell you that the smoot-hawley act was protectionism at its most self-destructive. it was a policy disaster of epic proportions that made a terrible situation catastrophically worse.  and this fox news clown and trump economist is suggesting that these tarrifs were the best thing america ever did since the invention of the light bulb. and furthermore, that everyone apart from him is simply too ignorant to realise this, because of course he's read a quote in a history book by thucydides. god bless the liberal arts curriculum.   yes indeed, you really do have to admire charles payne for starting off his analysis by quoting thucydides from his history of the peloponnesian war: ""most people in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth from politically unbiased, serious economic historians, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear from some two-bit fox news shock-jock business analyst, who doesn't know the first thing about economics."""

1. The Decline of Manufacturing and Global Outsourcing

Since the 1980s, the U.S. has increasingly shifted toward a service-based economy, relocating major manufacturing industries like automobiles, shipbuilding, and heavy chemicals to countries such as China and Mexico. This led to job losses and economic stagnation in many industrial regions.

2. The Impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis

The financial crisis, driven by the housing bubble and excessive risk-taking in the financial sector, severely impacted the U.S. economy. In contrast, manufacturing powerhouses like China and Germany suffered less damage, as their economies were more resilient to financial turmoil.

3. China's Rise and America's Relative Decline

China became the ""world’s factory"", gaining economic dominance over global supply chains. With strong industrial policies and technological advancements, China now competes with the U.S. in key sectors such as semiconductors, batteries, and artificial intelligence.

4. The Return of Protectionism and America-First Policies

As economic hardship grew, many Americans felt that their jobs were being outsourced, fueling support for Trump’s ""America First"" agenda. His policies focused on protectionism, anti-China measures, and reshoring manufacturing jobs, which resonated with struggling workers.

5. Efforts to Revive Manufacturing, but Challenges Remain

The Trump administration is also pushing to rebuild key industries like semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy within the U.S. However, high production costs and labor shortages make a full manufacturing revival difficult.

Ultimately, the decline of U.S. manufacturing and China’s rise have created long-term structural challenges for the American economy, leading to growing nationalism and protectionist policies.",,"why the u.s. economy is struggling: the collapse of manufacturing  1. the decline of manufacturing and global outsourcing  since the 1980s, the u.s. has increasingly shifted toward a service-based economy, relocating major manufacturing industries like automobiles, shipbuilding, and heavy chemicals to countries such as china and mexico. this led to job losses and economic stagnation in many industrial regions.  2. the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis  the financial crisis, driven by the housing bubble and excessive risk-taking in the financial sector, severely impacted the u.s. economy. in contrast, manufacturing powerhouses like china and germany suffered less damage, as their economies were more resilient to financial turmoil.  3. china's rise and america's relative decline  china became the ""world’s factory"", gaining economic dominance over global supply chains. with strong industrial policies and technological advancements, china now competes with the u.s. in key sectors such as semiconductors, batteries, and artificial intelligence.  4. the return of protectionism and america-first policies  as economic hardship grew, many americans felt that their jobs were being outsourced, fueling support for trump’s ""america first"" agenda. his policies focused on protectionism, anti-china measures, and reshoring manufacturing jobs, which resonated with struggling workers.  5. efforts to revive manufacturing, but challenges remain  the trump administration is also pushing to rebuild key industries like semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy within the u.s. however, high production costs and labor shortages make a full manufacturing revival difficult.  ultimately, the decline of u.s. manufacturing and china’s rise have created long-term structural challenges for the american economy, leading to growing nationalism and protectionist policies."

Economic efficiency is achieved when a product or service is produced or rendered at the lowest possible cost.

Examples:

It is much cheaper to grow oranges outdoors in tropical Florida than in Massachusetts' expensive greenhouses. This is due to Florida's favorable growing conditions, lower labor costs, and cost of living. So, we buy oranges from Florida.

The U.S. can import bamboo from Asia much more cheaply than it could be produced domestically, due to better growing conditions and cheap labor. So, we buy bamboo from Asia.

This forms the basis of trade.

The U.S. is currently importing billions more of these countries' products than it is exporting, creating a trade deficit and 8n some cases, violating trade agreements.

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2024, Canada imposes a tariff on dairy products imported from the United States. The tariff rates vary depending on the type and quantity of dairy products.
Class 7 Milk: 3.65% tariff
Ultrafiltered Milk: 14% tariff
Whey Protein Concentrate: 10% tariff
Butter: 298% tariff (yes, you read that right - nearly 300%!)
Cheese: 245% tariff
These tariffs were imposed as part of Canada's dairy supply management system, which aims to protect domestic dairy farmers and processors. However, it's worth noting that these tariffs have been a point of contention between the US and Canada, with the US arguing that they are unfair and restrict American dairy exports.

The idea that the United States “subsidizes” Canada to the tune of $200 billion annually is an erroneous interpretation of the economic and energy relationship between the two nations. This claim lacks the analytical rigor necessary to withstand scrutiny when we consider the facts. First, Canada is a critical supplier of energy to the U.S., providing a substantial portion of its crude oil and natural gas needs. Approximately 60% of U.S. crude oil imports come from Canada, most notably from Alberta's oil sands, a resource that represents a significant part of Canada's energy production CANADA ENERGY REGULATOR . The United States also imports 98% of Canada’s natural gas, an essential resource that powers homes and industries across the U.S. during the colder months EIA . This energy exchange is a matter of mutual necessity, not a one-sided dependency. The term ""subsidy"" implies one party is providing financial support to the other. In this context, it is crucial to distinguish between a trade relationship and a financial aid arrangement. The energy Canada provides is not given as a charity or a handout; it is sold at market prices, reflecting the value of the resources being exchanged. The United States, in return, exports over $300 billion in goods to Canada annually, including vehicles, machinery, and technology EIA . This reciprocal trade benefits both economies and underpins millions of jobs on both sides of the border. Furthermore, Canada’s defense contributions are often undervalued in discussions like these. Canada is not merely a passive recipient of American protection; the two countries cooperate through NORAD and share responsibility for the defense of North America. Canada’s military, though smaller than that of the U.S., plays an active role in peacekeeping and global security efforts. The assumption that Canada ""FREELOADS"" on the U.S. military is therefore logically flawed and ignores decades of joint action. In sum, this claim of a ""$200 billion subsidy"" does not withstand scrutiny when examined through the lens of facts. Canada’s role as a supplier of essential resources to the U.S. is a mutual exchange, one that supports both economies. Similarly, the defense partnership is based on shared responsibility, not a hierarchical arrangement where one side is a mere recipient of the other’s generosity.

US mills were protected, but the higher prices hurt steel buyers like car makers, economist estimate that the Tariffs created 1000 jobs in steel but cost 75,000 jobs among us companies overall” 

This is extremely misleading. Let’s break it down when you implement a tariff you are completely changing the supply chain.  So what happens? The people working in imports lose there job and have to change their direction. The wholesaler has to change and cuts out another middle man, the port in which it was being shipped through changes and on and on. So people lost there job yes but there is a shift in where the jobs are actually coming from. The other part “prices rose” well when you have 30% of all steel imported and are undermining the us manufacturers workers and wages and then add a tariff that creates a shortage or increases cost because it then takes time for hose company’s to bring their manufacturing back to the US and once in the US they then can compete on a level playing field in which would bring prices back down through competition. However we know prices won’t go down cause everything will only go up but it will grow the economy faster.

It's not that I completely disagree with the idea of relying less on China to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  But placing tariffs on ALL imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  INSTEAD of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from North, Central, and South America, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a US company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the U.S.  It would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  It would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the U.S. for work.    It would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the Panama Canal, because U.S. and Canadian imports from Mexico, C.A. and S.A. could come by train.  But Trump is the President now, so I guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve OUR (not just HIS) goals.  It would also ensure that those Central and S. American countries stay aligned with us instead of becoming more entwined with China.  Right now, it seems like Trump is pushing countries AWAY from us and TOWARDS closer economic and political ties with China",,"two big problems here.  1. trump isn't talking about just targeting china or only applying limited tariffs on a specific sector that needs protected from foreign dumping.  he is talking about universal tariffs on all imports, even from our allies and countries that we have tried to boost economically as part of stopping illegal immigration.  2. it sickens me to hear this man who won't feel a bit of pain in his personal life from the disruption and high prices many of us will struggle with if he gets his way just shrug off the harm this will do to so many by saying we could just switch back in a decade if it doesn't work.  i suggest people read up on the effects of the smoot-hawley tariffs of the early 20th century that led to the great depression. if he follows through on his plans, we could be looking at something very similar.  it's not that i completely disagree with the idea of relying less on china to provide our manufactured goods or using the federal government to invest tax dollars into industries critical for our self-defense.  but placing tariffs on all imports, even from close allies, is counterproductive to that goal.  instead of placing huge tariffs on imported products coming from north, central, and south america, we should be encouraging companies in those countries - sometimes in partnership with a us company - to ramp up manufacturing plants there that would produce a lot of the trinkets, and tiny parts used to make finished goods, that would be impossible to make cheaply in the u.s.  it would put that manufacturing within the borders of friendly countries.  it would provide jobs and economic growth for countries that currently see people fleeing to the u.s. for work.    it would drastically reduce the need for huge tanker ships bringing our stuff from the other side of the world or having to pass through the panama canal, because u.s. and canadian imports from mexico, c.a. and s.a. could come by train.  but trump is the president now, so i guess we just make big problems into huge problems and make things worse pretending to be a tough guy instead of coming up with a decent strategy to achieve our (not just his) goals.  it would also ensure that those central and s. american countries stay aligned with us instead of becoming more entwined with china.  right now, it seems like trump is pushing countries away from us and towards closer economic and political ties with china"

Especially when the goods has labor cost is higher than the raw material cost. When an good that is sold at $100, where the labor is at $30, and material at $20, with $50 profit, but if you give it a 100% tax, it's now selling at $200 dollars, allowing you to take (in theory) $100 for every $30 paid to labor (in China or India) and for every $50 the manufacture profits... but still it's NOT going to bring those jobs back to United States, because the labor cost in USA would be at $150 to $300 just to make a $200-product, and the profitabiliy of something sold at $200 minus the labor $150 and material $20, would only be $30 profit, at 15% ($30/$200) profitability, it's not going to attract any business to move its base back into United States... 

Meanwhile, people who used to be able to buy stuff at $100, now would have to buy it at $200, or even at $300 for products made in USA... it would have a short-term pain for the average households, and a long term drop in trade. People who sells stuff at $100 to the United States, would now look for customers outside of United States selling at $100 to make up for the loss of revenue.

In the end, average consumers would either find cheaper tag price items at $50 for much inferior quality, or people could end-up buying from a trip to Mexico or Canada to buy item at 50% discount and bring them in as 'personal comsumption' to evade the import tax.

The US feels entitled to be the best without the best resource, people. I work for a global company and there is no comparison for plants in MX, Brazil, India and China.

He was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. As a Congressman, he was responsible for the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect American industries. Later, as president, he signed the Dingley Tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in U.S. history until the 1930s.

However, McKinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. He began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. This was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage U.S. exports.

Why Was McKinley Assassinated?
McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. Czolgosz believed that McKinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. Inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the Pan-American Exposition. The president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on September 14, 1901. His assassination led to Theodore Roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the Progressive Era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy.",,"no, president william mckinley did not abandon his tariff policy. he was a strong proponent of protective tariffs, and his administration continued to support them. as a congressman, he was responsible for the mckinley tariff of 1890, which raised duties on imports to protect american industries. later, as president, he signed the dingley tariff of 1897, which further increased tariffs and remained the highest in u.s. history until the 1930s.  however, mckinley did shift his focus toward trade expansion in his second term. he began advocating for reciprocity agreements, which allowed for lower tariffs on certain goods in exchange for trade concessions from other countries. this was not an abandonment of protectionism but rather an adjustment to encourage u.s. exports.  why was mckinley assassinated? mckinley was assassinated on september 6, 1901, in buffalo, new york, by leon czolgosz, an anarchist who opposed government authority and capitalism. czolgosz believed that mckinley represented oppression and the growing power of big business. inspired by anarchist movements and the assassination of king umberto i of italy in 1900, he viewed the killing as an act of revolution.  czolgosz shot mckinley twice during a public meet-and-greet at the pan-american exposition. the president initially survived, but his condition worsened due to infection, and he died on september 14, 1901. his assassination led to theodore roosevelt becoming president and ushering in the progressive era, which brought significant reforms in business regulation, labor laws, and foreign policy."

A policy that works in one era may be counterproductive in another.

Looking at the U.S. today, it’s clear that something has to change. The country has an enormous GDP but is also drowning in debt, and a significant portion of its industries have been outsourced. The economic reality demands a radical shift—perhaps not the most popular choice, but one that prioritizes long-term stability for the American people. Tariffs may be the best available tool to achieve this.

History shows that tariffs have played a crucial role in shaping economic power. Around 1900, the U.S. implemented high tariffs that forced European exporters to pay more for market access. The effect was twofold: it protected American industries while making European goods more expensive. Now, over a century later, the world may witness a similar scenario. If the U.S. moves aggressively on tariffs again, Europe will undoubtedly feel the impact—higher costs, restricted access to the American market, and possible retaliatory measures.

Some industries in the U.S. will suffer in the short term, just as they did in previous protectionist periods. Agriculture, for example, could be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The automotive sector, which depends on foreign parts, will likely see increased costs. But history suggests that protective measures can also lead to long-term gains—revitalizing domestic industries, reducing economic dependence on foreign competitors, and giving the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

The global economy is deeply interconnected, and any major shift in U.S. policy will have ripple effects worldwide.

Far from reckless protectionism, the policy has already pressured Mexico to deploy troops against fentanyl trafficking and incentivized trade shifts that align with U.S. interests. These tariffs are not just economic penalties but a calculated effort to force concessions on critical issues like immigration, drug enforcement, and manufacturing imbalances.

Beyond diplomacy, tariffs serve a broader goal—reducing U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains and reviving domestic industries. With 42% of auto parts sourced from Mexico, targeted tariffs encourage reshoring, strengthening states like Michigan and Ohio. Selective rates, such as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy versus 25% on other goods, further reveal a nuanced strategy protecting key sectors without fully severing trade ties. This push for economic sovereignty is a response to vulnerabilities exposed by global crises, ensuring long-term resilience over short-term economic discomfort.

Critics who champion free trade often ignore its failures, from stagnant wages to the U.S.’s $180 billion trade deficit with Canada and Mexico.

(Applying the VCEC Theory 2.0)

When a competing economy (e.g., China or the EU) enters a deflationary spiral, the following self-reinforcing cycle occurs:

1. Falling Prices Lead to Margin Collapse
Overproduction and weak demand force price cuts, but lower prices don’t stimulate new demand (especially for durable goods like cars or appliances).
Profit margins shrink, making it harder for businesses to cover costs.
Companies desperately cut costs, slash wages, and lay off workers, further reducing demand.
 Example:

Chinese EV makers slash prices, but demand remains stagnant.
Low margins force weaker companies into bankruptcy, and job losses weaken domestic consumption.

2. Capital Flight & Currency Depreciation
Investors pull capital out of the struggling economy to seek safer, higher-yield assets (often in U.S. markets).
The local currency weakens due to capital outflows and collapsing corporate earnings.
A weaker currency raises import costs, worsening profitability for businesses relying on foreign components.
 Example:

China experiences capital flight to USD assets, further weakening the yuan.
Higher import costs on essential goods (e.g., semiconductors, energy) increase financial strain.

3. The U.S. Economy Strengthens from the Spiral
Foreign capital flows into U.S. Treasuries, stocks, and real estate, strengthening the dollar.
A strong USD lowers U.S. import costs, reducing inflationary pressures.
U.S. consumers maintain spending power, while competitors suffer from currency weakness.
 Example:

The strong dollar makes imported goods (oil, semiconductors) cheaper for the U.S.
Tariffed goods become more expensive for the competitor but not for the U.S., as production shifts elsewhere (e.g., Mexico, Vietnam).

4. Trade War Intensifies: Tariffs & Market Fragmentation
The U.S. exploits the competitor’s weakness by increasing tariffs or restricting market access to slow their recovery.
A collapsing competitor’s market means excess supply floods into weaker economies, creating a race to the bottom in pricing.
Tariffs block competitors from dumping excess supply into high-margin Western markets, forcing them into low-profit secondary markets (Africa, Latin America).
 Example:

China’s EVs are hit with 100% tariffs in the U.S. and EU, forcing them to sell at near-zero margins in poorer markets.
U.S. and EU firms gain market share, while BYD and other Chinese firms face financial collapse before Tesla or Ford feel pressure.

5. Economic Collapse Triggers Political Instability
Widespread factory closures, job losses, and economic stagnation fuel internal unrest.
Government bailouts fail to restore growth, leading to long-term stagnation (Japan’s ""Lost Decades"" scenario).
Political leaders turn to protectionism, stimulus, or military posturing to distract from economic failure.
 Example:

China struggles to contain financial fallout from failing industries and introduces state bailouts, which only delay collapse.
Export-driven economies like Germany suffer as global demand weakens, triggering an EU economic crisis.

6. U.S. Firms Win the Long-Term Game (Innovation + Market Control)
The U.S. absorbs capital, talent, and investment, further expanding its tech and financial sector dominance.
Companies in AI, semiconductors, and autonomous vehicles accelerate their lead over struggling competitors.
Full self-driving technology, AI-driven supply chains, and automation create new economic moats that competitors cannot match.
 Example:

Tesla, Google (Waymo), and U.S. AI firms dominate self-driving and Edge AI, making low-cost EV production irrelevant.
China’s focus on cutting EV prices becomes obsolete as AI-driven vehicle networks reshape the auto market.
Final Outcome: The U.S. Turns the Competitor’s Crisis into a Self-Reinforcing Economic Advantage
 Deflation in a competitor’s market weakens their ability to compete globally.
 Capital flight strengthens the USD, lowering U.S. import costs and sustaining domestic consumption.
 Tariffs block competitor recovery, forcing them into financial ruin before U.S. firms feel pressure.
 Technological dominance (AI, self-driving) becomes the real economic battleground, rendering low-cost production irrelevant.

 Final Take: If China or another major competitor falls into a deflationary spiral, the U.S. absorbs global capital, strengthens the dollar, blocks economic recovery through tariffs, and advances AI dominance—cementing its long-term economic supremacy. 


with targeted tariffs, you get to shift the supply chains and keep the value chain
reciprocity is only important if you actually have viable exports which the USA doesn't have

reciprocity should come once he builds the industry",,"what happens when a competitor’s market enters a deflationary spiral? (applying the vcec theory 2.0)  when a competing economy (e.g., china or the eu) enters a deflationary spiral, the following self-reinforcing cycle occurs:  1. falling prices lead to margin collapse overproduction and weak demand force price cuts, but lower prices don’t stimulate new demand (especially for durable goods like cars or appliances). profit margins shrink, making it harder for businesses to cover costs. companies desperately cut costs, slash wages, and lay off workers, further reducing demand.  example:  chinese ev makers slash prices, but demand remains stagnant. low margins force weaker companies into bankruptcy, and job losses weaken domestic consumption.  2. capital flight & currency depreciation investors pull capital out of the struggling economy to seek safer, higher-yield assets (often in u.s. markets). the local currency weakens due to capital outflows and collapsing corporate earnings. a weaker currency raises import costs, worsening profitability for businesses relying on foreign components.  example:  china experiences capital flight to usd assets, further weakening the yuan. higher import costs on essential goods (e.g., semiconductors, energy) increase financial strain.  3. the u.s. economy strengthens from the spiral foreign capital flows into u.s. treasuries, stocks, and real estate, strengthening the dollar. a strong usd lowers u.s. import costs, reducing inflationary pressures. u.s. consumers maintain spending power, while competitors suffer from currency weakness.  example:  the strong dollar makes imported goods (oil, semiconductors) cheaper for the u.s. tariffed goods become more expensive for the competitor but not for the u.s., as production shifts elsewhere (e.g., mexico, vietnam).  4. trade war intensifies: tariffs & market fragmentation the u.s. exploits the competitor’s weakness by increasing tariffs or restricting market access to slow their recovery. a collapsing competitor’s market means excess supply floods into weaker economies, creating a race to the bottom in pricing. tariffs block competitors from dumping excess supply into high-margin western markets, forcing them into low-profit secondary markets (africa, latin america).  example:  china’s evs are hit with 100% tariffs in the u.s. and eu, forcing them to sell at near-zero margins in poorer markets. u.s. and eu firms gain market share, while byd and other chinese firms face financial collapse before tesla or ford feel pressure.  5. economic collapse triggers political instability widespread factory closures, job losses, and economic stagnation fuel internal unrest. government bailouts fail to restore growth, leading to long-term stagnation (japan’s ""lost decades"" scenario). political leaders turn to protectionism, stimulus, or military posturing to distract from economic failure.  example:  china struggles to contain financial fallout from failing industries and introduces state bailouts, which only delay collapse. export-driven economies like germany suffer as global demand weakens, triggering an eu economic crisis.  6. u.s. firms win the long-term game (innovation + market control) the u.s. absorbs capital, talent, and investment, further expanding its tech and financial sector dominance. companies in ai, semiconductors, and autonomous vehicles accelerate their lead over struggling competitors. full self-driving technology, ai-driven supply chains, and automation create new economic moats that competitors cannot match.  example:  tesla, google (waymo), and u.s. ai firms dominate self-driving and edge ai, making low-cost ev production irrelevant. china’s focus on cutting ev prices becomes obsolete as ai-driven vehicle networks reshape the auto market. final outcome: the u.s. turns the competitor’s crisis into a self-reinforcing economic advantage  deflation in a competitor’s market weakens their ability to compete globally.  capital flight strengthens the usd, lowering u.s. import costs and sustaining domestic consumption.  tariffs block competitor recovery, forcing them into financial ruin before u.s. firms feel pressure.  technological dominance (ai, self-driving) becomes the real economic battleground, rendering low-cost production irrelevant.   final take: if china or another major competitor falls into a deflationary spiral, the u.s. absorbs global capital, strengthens the dollar, blocks economic recovery through tariffs, and advances ai dominance—cementing its long-term economic supremacy.    with targeted tariffs, you get to shift the supply chains and keep the value chain reciprocity is only important if you actually have viable exports which the usa doesn't have for revenue is just  a tax  reciprocity should come once he builds the industry"

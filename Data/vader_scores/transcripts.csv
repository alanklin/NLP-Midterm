1,bbc_news,"We begin with the breaking news. A fresh trade war between the US and China has just kicked off. An hour and a half ago, the US went ahead with its promise of 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods headed to the us. China quickly responded and announced its to do the same in a tit for tat spat that could impact the global economy. China's finance ministry is saying the measures against US goods would take effect. Next Monday, an extra 10% tax will be added to goods including crude oil and agricultural machinery, imports of coal. And Nick liquified natural gas will be hit with 15% tariffs. It's also saying it's filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the action from the US. In Asia. Stock markets were riding high earlier today with Hong Kong's hang saying, opening up over 3% higher. The Nick, a 2 25 in Tokyo was up more than one and a half percent.
But since the announcements of new tariffs in the US and China, the markets are now muted on Wall Street. Heavy losses were clawed back on Monday. As the news broke that 25% tariffs on Mexico are to be delayed for a month hours later. A similar deal was announced with Canada. After President Trump spoke to Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau and Canada agreed to ensure further security at its border on North America. Business correspondent Michelle Flury is in the town of Windsor, Ontario in Canada. It's right by the US border where she's been getting reaction to all these latest developments

In response to the threat of tariffs. Some Canadian liquor stores had pulled us browns from their shelves. Tonight they are being restocked. The trade war averted for now, but for some the break may be permanent.

For me, a lines been crossed.

Monica more canceled subscriptions to Amazon and Netflix. Two American companies, because of Trump's trade threats, she isn't planning to sign back up.

It's like the whims of someone who changes from day to day. It's not acceptable. And for me, I think it's broken something. I can't trust the US to be the ally anymore.

At Laval, they make parts used in other goods. They were bracing for the worst. Around 80% of Candida's exports end up in America. Even with the delay, Laval, president Jonathan, as a party said, questions remain.

The uncertainty is as bad of the tariffs. This company has been in business for over 50 years. That 50 years of success came from both sides working together, creating relationships that took a very long time to create. And now knowing that that relationship was as fragile as it is and that one person's agenda can change that whole relationship and change the course of a business that's been around for half a century hurts a lot

Here in Windsor, Ontario. You can see the American city of Detroit just across the river tonight, the feeling of betrayal by a neighbor replaced by a sense of relief. But for how long? Michelle Flurry, BBC News, Windsor, Ontario.

Well, Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted he had a good call with President Trump and will be implementing a $1.3 billion plan reinforcing the border with new choppers technology and personnel enhanced coordination with our American partners and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border. Trudeau also said Canada would appoint a fentanyl czar list cartels as terrorists and launch a Canada US joint strike force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering. Show Lander is senior lecturer of economics at Concordia University. I asked him if Justin Trudeau has done enough to keep the threat of tariffs at bay.

Probably when Trump was elected, he had texted out that the tariffs were coming unless Canada controlled fentanyl and immigrants crossing the northern border into the us. I'm not entirely sure how big a problem those two things are or whether they're more imagined in Trump's mind. But given that there's now going to be much more enhanced border security to try and stop whatever fentanyl and immigrants are crossing, that was the precondition to make the tariffs go away. So we don't know in 30 days whether he's going to ask for something else or that's going to be the opening part of the negotiation, but allegedly what Trudeau offered today was what he wanted.

In the meantime, mocho, what are you hearing about how people are positioning themselves in the light of this potential conflict?

Consumers are upset. They've started boycotts. I'm not sure how long the boycots are going to last or how much they realize does in fact come from the us but consumers don't like the thought and Canadians have a reputation for being kind hearted and generous people. But we can also be extremely proud and defensive when our country is under threat. Businesses, of course, are very concerned too. A lot of our natural resource-based industry is powering the US literally and figuratively. And so there have been threats that will turn out the lights in the US if they want to tariff us. I don't think that that's exactly the best strategy, but that just shows the degree to which Canadians are upset. That one man, as you played in an earlier clip, has the capacity to really wreck the Canadian economy.

So that's the situation in Canada. But what about China where 10% tariffs have just been applied to Chinese exports to the US and China has just announced its following suit with a raft of terrorists be applied to American goods. Dr. Harry Broadman is a trade expert with Rand Corporation and told me this is just the beginning.

Yes, it's just the latest chapter in our relationship with China. I think really epitomized by how Trump sees China as a mono bargaining situation. Just like, and frankly he did with Canada and Mexico and China's very smart. They've picked US exports that are very sensitive to US firms, and you can be sure that those firms are giving an earful to Mr. Trump right now.

Yeah, it'd be interesting to see how this plays out. President Trump is saying he's going to speak to President Xi later this week. He had phone calls with Claudia Shine Baum yesterday and just in Trudeau of Canada. That seemed to lead to a good result. Could we see the same for China?

Sure. And I believe that Xi is expecting that because now the cat is out of the bag, that this is how Trump wants to use tariffs as a beginning perhaps of a discussion. It's quite extraordinary if you're in a real serious trade war, you're not expecting to then get on the phone with the head of state just after you've imposed something. So I think this is quite orchestrated by the way that Trump sees the world and what he wants to use as a bargaining chip. And what's also extraordinary is some of the items that are coming up in the trade war are not necessarily economic merchandise items, but other things like the border. And so it's as if that Trump sees tariffs as his only tool in the toolkit to try to change our policy with respect to other countries

With Canada and Mexico. Some might argue it was quite simple to promise to President Trump what he wanted. IE much more security at the border, many more measures to prevent fentanyl crossing across, et cetera, et cetera. With China, it's not so simple, is it?

Absolutely not. I mean, our supply chains, as everyone knows with China, are quite sophisticated and quite complex in terms of both up and down the supply chain. So I think this is not just a question of fixing a border or dealing with a drug problem. Not that those are insignificant, but you have a network of factories and supply chain ships, trucks, consumers, workers, everybody is affected when you have the two largest economies of the world beginning a trade war. Now, whether this trade war actually turns out to be a trade war and she and Trump speak on the phone, which was already planned, who knows. Maybe in the next day or two she will say something that will satisfy Trump. I don't think so, but I think that's the, that is going on in the background here, and it really undercuts, I think, Trump's strategy to try to be a strong man relative to other countries around the world using tariffs.

Dr. Harry Broadman there who was a former US assistant trade representative and chief of staff in the US President's Council of Economic Advisors. So interesting to get his take on things. Let's now get an expert view on the market reaction. So it's proving to be another roller coaster ride for traders today. As I mentioned earlier in Asia, shares in Hong Kong were rallying. They opened up over 3%. That was also the case in Japan and other markets in Asia. But now investors are wary again with the trade spat between the US and China gathering speed. Russ Ma is investment director at AJ Bell and shared with me his view.

Interesting to see that those rallies we saw in Asia this morning didn't get back all of the ground they lost yesterday because there's still the 30 day option for Trump to bring Tarris back on Canada and Mexico. There were the new tariffs on China, which have now come in, and there were the old ones which are still there, and there's still a source of conflict between the two. And now we have the additional complication of China raising the stakes. Now we'll see what comes out of those talks. Reluctantly, looking at President Trump's ex feeded, he seems to be linking a trade deal with China to what happens with TikTok in particular?

Well, I was just going to say actually, it's really interesting. In Hong Kong, the big winners today are all the tech stocks. There's conversations about the future of TikTok is likely to be revealed soon that negotiations are ongoing. It's, as I said to Harry Broadman, it's such a complicated relationship, isn't it, between the us, China on so many levels.

Yeah. The customs duties that America generates overall in our modern double where they were eight years ago when President Trump introduced his first tariffs on Chinese goods such as washing machines, steel and aluminum, and the Biden administration didn't remove those and it actually added to them. So the tensions have been going on now for eight years and they haven't come down. Technology, national security, intellectual property are all very, very hot issues between the two nations. And whether one phone call can resolve them or not is difficult to tell, but it seems unlikely.

It will be interesting to see what happens after the conversation between President Trump and President Xi, which we're told will happen sometime this week. But from China's perspective, its economy is in a tough spot, has been really since the pandemic, the growth is not kicking in. There's all sorts of issues impacting the Chinese economy. This couldn't come at a worse time, could it?

No. You could argue from President Trump's perspective his arguments. Therefore, the ideal times are habit in that China's economi, as you say, is struggling. It's coming out of a real estate bust. Its infrastructure and domestic spending model is struggling to take up the load and its other economic engine has been exports to the world which America is now trying to hem in. So from a US perspective, it's a good time to apply pressure from a Chinese perspective. As you say, it's a very, very difficult one for them as they try and get domestic consumption going.

Rusal there from AJ Bell. Well, let's stay with the China US relationship. China says it is to probe the US tech giant Google over violations of anti-monopoly laws. Beijing State administration for market regulation is saying the US tech giant was, and this is a quote suspected of violating the anti-monopoly law of the people's Republic of China. Let's go to our Asia business hub, Marico. OI is there with the details. What can you tell us, Marico?

Well, Sally, as you said, the announcement came just as Beijing announced those retaliatory tariffs. Shortly after that deadline passed for US, tariffs on China passed. Of course, Google search services though in China have been blocked since 2010. So many started asking what is actually the target? What kind of business activities are still taking place in China? By Google for example, its Android operating system, reportedly has more than half the smartphone market used by companies like Xmi and Vivo and opo still. So still quite a big business for Google. Also, Google still provides apps and games to the Chinese market through partnership with local developers. So those are the business activities that are targeted by this investigation. But many analysts, as you've just been talking to your guests about it, have been saying that these announcements appear rather symbolic because even some of the products that China imports from the United States that have been hit by these territory tariffs, for example, crude oil China doesn't import much of it from the United States. So all these announcements, while of course are very big and sending a clear signal to Washington about Beijing's Beijing's expression of or response to those tariffs. It does seem rather symbolic and it seems like quite a similar story when it comes to this Google's case as well.

Okay, Marico for now, thank you. Around the world and across the uk. This is BBC News."
2,bbc_news,"There are growing fears of a major global trade war tonight. After President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China starting tomorrow, and he added that very substantial tariffs would follow for the European Union. Goods exported from Canada and Mexico to the US will be hit with a 25% tariff products from China with 10% Canada's prime Minister. Justin Trudeau said his country would face difficult times as a result, but promised a forceful retaliation from Washington. Here's our North America editor, Sarah Smith.

He had promised to introduce tough tariffs on day one. President Trump's obviously a couple of weeks late, but clearly excited about one of his favorite policy tools.

I always say tariffs is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It's going to bring our country's businesses back that left us.

President Trump wants both Mexico and Canada to do more, to stop migrants crossing their borders and into America and to stem the flow of illegal drugs, including fentanyl that's flooding into the us.

The president will be implementing tomorrow a 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada, and a 10% tariff on China for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country.

Hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports are trucked from Mexico and Canada into America and the other way around. They are each other's biggest trading partners by far. For instance, 90% of the avocados sold in America come from Mexico, charging a 25% tax on each fruit that crosses the border will hurt Mexican exporters, but it also risks increasing prices for American consumers. Canada's biggest export to America is oil, even 10% import tariffs, risk raising costs for Americans, and of course Canada will also feel the pain if America buys less of their oil. The Prime Minister says

He's ready to respond. If the president does choose to implement any tariffs against Canada, we're ready with a response. A purposeful, forceful, but reasonable immediate response.

10% tariffs will be charged on all the electronic and other goods that are shipped to America from China. Donald Trump says he wants China to stop Fentanyl being exported to America, but of course it doesn't hurt to also punish one of your biggest global competitors, other executive powers. Donald Trump firmly believes he's the world's best negotiator and appears confident that punishing terrorists will force other nations to do what he wants. But if that doesn't happen quickly, he's risking a trade war that could result in American voters paying the price.

And let's talk to Sarah in Washington tonight. The president's only really been talking about in the last few minutes. Sarah, tell us more.

Yeah, he was in the Oval Office signing the executive order that will bring in these tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. And he was asked if he had any plans to put tariffs on goods coming in from the eu and he said, absolutely. He thinks the EU treats American products very unfairly. He said, and he referenced VAT value added tax being levied at 20%, which he seems to think is akin to some kind of trade tariff that he wants to counter. So he didn't say when, and he didn't say what level of tariffs, but he did say he wants to do it. Have a listen to this.

And we have a tremendous deficit with the European Union, so we'll be doing something very substantial with the European Union. We're going to bring the level up to where it should be.

Now, the level of terrace, he's talking about 25% against Mexico and Canada, 10% on China. These are huge. This is not the normal level at which countries tend to operate when they're doing these trade negotiations. And of course, it's actually about Donald Trump trying to enforce an entirely different policy on the border with these countries asking for their cooperation. So this is something pretty new, and it could be risky. I mean, he said whilst he was in the Oval Office there, that there is a chance that the costs will be passed on to consumers. And he knows that if anything he did was to increase prices in America, put inflation up, that would be very, very dangerous for his popularity. So I wonder if he's trying to make a case that this will be done very quickly. If he gets what he wants from Canada, Mexico, and China, then these tariffs won't have to be in place for very long and he won't risk putting the costs up for American consumers.

Sarah, thank you Sarah Smith. Well, many Chinese businesses were certain that tariffs like this were on their way and have been taking preemptive action. As Laura bicker reports, many have moved their production lines offshore to places including Cambodia.

This all American cowboy boot once crafted to conquer the Wild West has been made here in China for decades. But production has slowed as orders dwindle us buyers don't want to risk more of Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese made goods. Mr. Pong says a hundred different skills are needed to make each shoe. That's why he doesn't want to move the workshop out of China.

In the end, it is the workers at the bottom who suffer with higher tariffs. We have higher costs. With higher costs. We have fewer orders. The workers' income will decrease.

These are the victims at the center of Mr. Trump's trade war, a skilled workforce that know no other job. Other Chinese companies, however, are on the move. Parts of Cambodia have given itself to Beijing. Half the country's investment now flows from China. These clothes are heading to US firms like Walmart and Costco. The factory and its workers are in Cambodia, but most of the materials still come from China. Ang Gong shows off his newly built factory in pin pen as he gets ready for larger orders,

Factories along the whole supply chain are relocating. As a result, lots of Chinese companies are investing in Cambodia and Southeast Asia.

This factory is hiring hundreds more workers as profits Soar. Successes like this one increased China's footprint across Southeast Asia.

Chinese firms have been coming here for over a decade, but that is now accelerating. Around 90% of all garment factories in this country are now Chinese run or Chinese owned.

President Trump's tariff have not stopped. China's rise. Beijing has simply gone elsewhere to do business. US bound creates now ship from Cambodia as China navigates its way through this trade war. It may be losing some money in this battle, but it is gaining power and influence. Loda bicker, BBC News on Pen."
3,bbc_news,"I'm Helena Humphrey. Good to have you with us. We begin with breaking news out of the White House where US President Donald Trump has signed tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, America's top trading partners. Now, a 25% tariff is imposed on Canadian goods with a 10% levy placed on Canadian oil exports. Mexico has been slapped with a similar 25% tax, and President Trump has also placed a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods coming into the United States, where the White House says that the tariffs are meant to quote, hold China, Mexico, and Canada accountable for the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States. The tariffs are set to come into effect on Tuesday. That's according to the administration. Well, Canadian officials are decrying. The Trump administration's move in statements online. On Terrier's premier Doug Ford said that the tariffs will quote hurt America writing that Canada now has no choice but to hit back and hit back hard.
Meanwhile, China's ministry of commerce repeated its earlier message of caution that there would be no winner in a trade war. And Mexican president Claudia Scheinbaum, has yet to issue an updated statement, but she has previously said that she would approach tariffs with a cool head for joining me live. Now, to talk about all of this is Arturo Han, who formerly served as Ambassador of Mexico to the United States from 2007 to 2013. Welcome to you ambassador. Thank you for being with US, Mexico, of course, one of the United States closest trading partners. So what impact do you think 25% tariffs would have on that relationship?

Well, Helen, it's actually the first trading partner now of the United States for almost two years in a row. This is in soccer terms, it's a known goal, but if you want it in American parlance, it's a self-inflicted wound because these countries, Canada, Mexican, United States, these supply chains that have become so integrated vertebra will have a profound impact on inflation on the wellbeing of US households. There's an estimate that these tariffs, if they remain in place for over a month or so, we'll start costing each US household $830 in extra taxes.

So do you think there is a way back from this? We know that the Mexican president, Claudia Shine Baum has said that she's essentially got a plan up her sleeve, but she will act with a cool head. So what do you think could come next from Mexico?

Well, I think it's hard for either Canada or Mexico not to respond in kind with some form of countervailing duties. I think that a generalized countervailing due to your tariff from Mexico would not be a good idea again, because what you want to prevent is by disrupting your own supply chains, elevating inflation costs, cost of living for Mexicans. But I think some form of counter duties will be levied on the us. The big question mark here obviously is whether this is a negotiating tactic. There are some included yours truly, that believe that some of this is to force an early renegotiation of the U-S-M-C-A, which is up for a review in 2026, Canada, Mexico, United States governments need to sit down in July of 2026 to review how U-S-M-C-A has been working. And the sense some of us have is that this may be beyond the linkage to fentanyl immigration, the bluster and the threat, and be able to prove to his constituents that he has kept his promise. There may be an attempt to force an early renegotiation of U-S-M-C-A.

So how effective or not do you think that could be as somebody with your diplomatic hat on when it comes to immigration, but also beyond that as you've just outlined with that trade pact?

Well, the problem is that if you look at the numbers in terms of immigration flows on the US Mexico border, they've been the lowest even since when Donald Trump was in the White House in the first time around, Mexico has been accepting the outsourcing of enforcement driven policies by the US first with Trump, then with Biden, numbers are at the lowest since the pandemic, and so there's a bit of a disconnect between the rationale for using tariffs to put pressure on Mexico on this specific issue, the fentanyl and organized crime issue. That's a completely different can of worms. I think this is in part Mexico's fault because the previous Mexican government of Andre Manor completely gutted and eviscerated collaboration with United States and the fight against organized crime and this legacy in terms of what Mexico has been doing, the fentanyl trafficking that we're seeing coming either in precursors or fentanyl pills.
This is an important issue. But where I think the President Trump has made a big mistake is on two fronts. Number one, this linkage creating pressure points by putting pressure, using different issues of the bilateral agenda, putting pressure on trade to get something to change and immigration or drug policy in a very, very complex, deep relationship. This is a bad move because it makes things much more difficult to manage diplomatically. The second part is that Washington the US is immersed in what I think is the most important recalibration of its foreign policy since the end of the Cold War, which is its relationship with China.

And

If that recalibration is going to be successful, particularly when it comes to the economy to trade flows, it needs Canada and Mexico. And so by slapping these tariffs, Beijing must be rubbing its hands right now.

Ambassador, briefly, if you don't mind, is there any way back from the brink through either side here?

Well, there might be, I think that there's a bit of a sense that there will be negotiations and conversations in the coming days. Maybe at some point President Trump can claim that he has achieved his objectives, that Mexico is doing X and Y, that Canada is doing X and Y, and that he is suspending or putting those tariffs on hold. That is a possibility indeed,

Khan, who formerly served as Ambassador of Mexico to the United States from 2007 to 2013. Very good to get your perspective. Thanks a lot.

A pleasure, Helen."
1,bloomberg,"Congratulations, Mr.

Well, he's back and guess what he's talking about? We will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. This is a surprise to no one

Because

It's one of his favorite subjects. I do like tariffs, tariff, tariffs, tariffs, tremendous tariffs, tariff, tariffs, tariffs that are massive. To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.

Trump has ordered federal agencies to investigate the impact of tariff policies, or in his words, recommend appropriate measures like global tariffs to fix these deficits. The topic was low on boardroom agendas under former President Biden, but since Trump's election in November, talk of tariffs has spiked,

The new president has promised to put tariffs on goods coming to the US from all around the world, not just from trading rivals such as China.

He's seeing tariffs as a leverage point to get other people to do what he wants.

In his first week back, Trump threatened to enact 10% tariffs on China, 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and to use them as a tool to try to stop the Russia, Ukraine war

Trade policy under President Trump has the potential to send shock waves through the global economy

Even if Trump's threats don't materialize. The mere thought of a trade war is already appending international relations and forcing companies to prepare for the worst.

I feel like a pawn in a big game of chess.

Let's start with what we know. Tariffs are government imposed taxes on imported goods and services, which increase the cost of imports, and that's the whole point to make them less competitive compared to domestic products In a bid to help or protect local industries, their use in the United States declined dramatically after World War ii.

More and more, the cargo ships of the great trading nations are making New Orleans a regular port of coal.

And in the globalized nineties, they became a dirty word.

No country can escape the global economy and the greatest, largest, most powerful country in the

World cannot escape the global economy. Broadly speaking, everyone agreed that the freer flowing of goods and services lended to prosperity for all. But that kind of economic thinking has been turned on its head when it became clear that there are not just winners, but they're also losers from globalization. President Trump wants tariffs to raise revenue for the government. He wants tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the us and of course, he wants tariffs to level the books with key trading rivals around the world,

While Trump frames his tariffs as a way of raising trillions of dollars to pay for tax cuts. It's worth taking a look at the numbers. The blue line is what the government has estimated to collect from existing tariffs over the next four years, only a drop in the bucket compared to the black line, which shows revenue from income tax. Of course, we shouldn't forget that we have been here before.

President Trump's first term when he implemented tariffs. It sent shockwaves around the world because was breaking with convention front page of every newspaper in the country. Right now, a dive on the Dow. Because of this trade war

In Trump's first trade war, the scope of the tariffs was targeted toward capital goods and intermediate goods from China, and it was not a very large increase in tariff rates. So overall, it took average tariff rates from 1.5% to about 4.5% on overall US imports. During that second half of 2019, the trade policy uncertainty was clearly having an impact on dampening business investment. So it deescalated in late 2019 when the US and China signed the phase one agreement. In

The phase one deal. China promised to buy at least $200 billion more in US goods and services, but that didn't happen. Now Trump wants to change that and cut a new deal with the Chinese government.

Until I came along, China never paid 10 cents to this country. They ripped us off and they never paid anything

Even before Trump's inauguration day memo calling for a fresh look at US, China trade relations companies in China have been bracing themselves for a second trade war by chasing new markets and offshoring production to neighboring countries. The memo also singled out Canada and Mexico using tariffs as leverage to achieve domestic policy goals.

We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada because they're allowing vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl.

Whatever the motivation, it's American companies that could suffer the most.

US auto industry has a very long supply chain that is very complicated, that takes many parts for many countries. A lot of this supply chain and auto parts came from Canada and Mexico. So imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico basically effectively would be imposing tariffs on GM and forts production.

If he goes ahead with the kind of threats that he's talking about, then you would see question marks over how will that impact inflation? How will that impact where business puts their investment? How will it impact the flow of goods around the world?

Many US businesses are trying to war game what's coming next.

During the first Trump presidency when tariffs were enacted, it was the biggest strain our company has ever seen. A hundred percent of our products are manufactured in China. It took us 24 to 36 months to adjust the supply chain. I would estimate the spend to be around $30 million. If new tariffs are enacted, the costs are going up, and if our cost of goods sold goes up, unfortunately the cost for everybody goes up. This is not a tax on other countries. This is a tax on you,

And that's really only the first layer of the onion as you can't have a trade war without retaliation. Something that on the surface, the US might have an upper hand in

China has more to lose than the US because US imports about 450 billion of goods from China, but China only imports 150 billion of goods from us. So even if China wants to retaliate against the US tariffs, there's only 150 billion of US goods to retaliate.

But China's intrinsic role in global supply chains could offer fresh methods of retaliation.

China dominates the production of some important metals such as germanium, gallium, and these are metals that are very critical to build semiconductors. So if China were to impose export controls on these crucial minerals that will have knock on effects in US ability to build up the AI industry or build up semiconductor plans,

I'll bet it all. And as with any fight, things can get personal.

So in the first Trump administration eu, in retaliation to the US steel and aluminum tariff imposed 25% tariffs on US bourbon from Kentucky with the explicit goal of making Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Senator unpopular. And similarly, China decides on what to retaliate in order to hit at the red states, the agriculture centers in the us. And so the industry that could suffer from a retaliation from a trade partners could range from agriculture, winemakers and automakers.

But like all policy, the devil is in the details. Something the international business community anxiously awaits the how and the when and for how long. All remain unknown and that uncertainty takes its toll on the economy.

The challenge becomes are you protecting against the risk of tariff? Are you protecting against the risk that expected tariffs are not going to be put on?

It's been found that when uncertainty on trade policy increased, what you have in a couple quarters down the line tends to be economic slowdown.

When Trump was last in office, news coverage of trade policy uncertainty was high. It dropped under Biden and stayed low. But now that trump's back, so is the uncertainty.

I can't tell you if our cost is going to go up by 0%, 10%, or 25%. I have no idea what's coming. And when you're having vague conversations with your big customers, they don't like it.

Ultimately, how this trade war impacts both the US and global economy will depend on the specifics. We'll have a long way to go before we can truly count the costs and the benefit of it."
3,bloomberg,"We are continuing to get headlines out of the White House from President Trump talking about reciprocal tariffs. He has ordered his administration to consider imposing reciprocal tariffs on numerous trading partners to rebalance trade relations. The tariffs would be customized for each country offsetting not just their own levies on US goods, but also non tariff barriers that limit us trade. And he hopes to have a discussion with other nations about existing policies that have created an imbalanced trade environment open also to lowering tariffs of countries, remove trade powers. So again, we'll continue to monitor those headlines.

Yeah, we're getting some other headlines too, even as you speak, Carol, the president saying that the EU doesn't treat the US right when it comes to trade. And just a reminder, he did say this about seven or eight minutes ago that prices may go up in the short term. We'll bring you his comments live when that tape does start to roll a little later in the program.

Yeah. Also says, could start the reciprocal plan by April 2nd. So a little bit of delay. Let's get to it. What does it all mean? Bloomberg News, senior economics writer, Sean Donan is out there in our Washington DC News Bureau and then right here in our New York studio, Bloomberg News, international Economics and policy correspondent Michael McKee. Hey Sean, let's start with you. The president was tweeting or not tweeting, I guess, putting it out on his social media platform early this morning about reciprocal tariffs. We were widely reporting it. We're starting to get some details. What jumps out for you?

Well, look, when he got up this morning, he put out on truth social that this was the big one, and he's kind of delivered in a way, the broadest set of tariffs that he has so far. But the key point here is that we don't yet know. And he said, actually he doesn't know yet what the numbers will be. There's going to be a process to study what these tariffs should be on individual countries. They are going to be targeting the countries with whom the US has the biggest trade deficits. That's going to be the eu that's going to be also countries like Vietnam and South Korea. Japan is going to be in the mix as well. And they're going to go country by country and take a look at essentially the barriers that US goods face when they head into those economies. Now the big headline point and the kind of broadening out of the tariff wars that we've seen today is Trump target how other countries tax or levy taxes.
And that is particularly focused on value added taxes or VAT. And that's big in the eu. There's more than 160 countries in the world that use A VAT. The US of course does not. This kind of rekindles a battle that the US has had on and off with Europe since the 1960s over how to treat taxes and trade. But we're going to end up with, I think we can expect some big numbers aimed at some big trading partners. We just don't yet know what those numbers are going to be. But the economic war, if you will, is broadening out. This isn't just about tariffs anymore, it's about taxes, it's about regulation and other stuff.

One more headline coming out of the president in the White House, president Trump saying on exemptions or waivers being asked about that. And he says, I don't expect that. So that is certainly something we think about when tariffs are being imposed.

Hey Mike McKee, come on in here because you've been following this closely as well. You mentioned to me just before we went on air what Sean was talking about, this idea of the value added tax and that being a target of the president. Explain the significance of that.

Well, the countries, particularly in Europe, as Sean said, impose a value added tax, which taxes the value added each step of manufacturing and also the value added by retailers. And so if you've spent any time in Europe, you bought anything, you pay that tax on top of that. And if you're from out of the country, you can get it refunded when you go to Heathrow. But the

Been there, done that.

But because this is added on top of the cost of the US goods, Trump says he considers it a tax. Different countries have different tax rates, but they're all fairly significant.

Meaning we could reciprocate what the VAT is in other countries in tariffs of our own on those countries that impose the vats.

But it's hard to know exactly what reciprocate means in this case because we're not doing one for one because it's not just tariff levels. It's also going to be the vat. It's going to be subsidies that maybe governments give to companies there, regulations, ESG kind of stuff and exchange rates. The White House says. So that's why Howard Lutnick has to go back and try to figure out what the appropriate number for each country is. And it shows that this is a big one because there's a lot that's going into this now and it's in theory could add a lot to the cost of trade. And as you mentioned Carol, with the headline, this doesn't include cars, this doesn't include pharma. There's a lot of things yet to be tariff."
1,cnn,"Min min, what has been announced so far from Beijing?

Well, as you said, that antitrust investigation into Google, as well as a series of tariffs, 10 to 15% on American agricultural machines, as well as oil, coal, LNG, a couple of American companies added to this unreliable entity list. And also export control on tungsten related materials. Materials used for solar panels, semiconductors, very precise, very targeted measures, although not extensive, but it shows that China is not going to back down without a fight. Now, some analysts had expected that maybe China will not retaliate so quickly and clearly this is a very highly choreographed move, given that China had waited exactly until after the tariff kicked in at 1:01 PM local Beijing time before announcing these series of coordinated measures. And this comes as Trump had said, he plans to speak with presidency within 24 hours. That was several hours ago. And he said that if no deal is reached, that the terrorists could be very, very substantial. So 10% is just a starting point. It could go up or go down from there, depending on how negotiations go.

Yeah. China and Beijing clearly had a ready to bake response, didn't they? Quick, swift, and targeted, as you say, oven ready response from Beijing. Where do we stand then on those talks between China and the us?

Well, there's really an infinite number of ways that negotiations could go, and one thing that China could do is maybe to return to that starting point of the first trade deal that was struck with President Trump in his first term in office, committing to buy maybe a certain number amount of American products in exchange for other things that they want. For instance, more market access into the US or perhaps being able to buy what they want to buy, including advanced semiconductors. For example, president Trump had said that the reason for imposing these tariffs include fentanyl, China producing the ingredients for that. And this is perhaps an off ramp that could be offered to China because that is a low hanging fruit is something that Beijing could very easily clamp down on if it so chooses to. This is also something that both countries have already began working on, so that's one possible thing. But again, many of these measures, they're not that easy to undo. Once you're on an entity list, it's not that easy to get off it, so it remains to be seen how those negotiations will go, and it's really a trade war that could escalate further, and we'll have to see what happens in the next few days."
2,cnn,"President Trump's new tariffs are keeping one campaign promise, but turning his back on another, tackling inflation, something he repeatedly promised on the campaign trail.

So when I win, I will immediately bring prices down starting on day one.

So we are now two weeks into President Trump's presidency, and he's now imposing stiff tariffs on the country's biggest trading partners, Mexico, Canada, and China. Those countries now promising to retaliate. An economists warn this could all mean higher prices on everyday things like food, clothing, alcohol, sneakers, toys. Some experts predict it could cost more than $2,600 a year for the typical US household. CNN's Elena Trina is joining us now from West Palm Beach and Elena, the president acknowledging today that yeah, there might be what he called some short-term pain here.

That's exactly right, Jessica. Just hours really after he had signed those tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, he acknowledged what many economists, people on Capitol Hill as well as even some of his own advisors I'd note in a previous life, of course have been warning for some time now, which is that these tariffs may directly impact American consumers. As you mentioned, we did hear the president acknowledge this in a post to true social this morning. I want to read for you just some of that post. It was a bit lengthy, but I thought this line was in particularly very notable. It said, this will be the golden age of America. Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not, but we will make America great again and it will all be worth the price that must be paid. I really think that last line there, it will all be worth the price that must be paid.
It's kind of a warning to a lot of people who have been concerned about these tariffs. Look, the president has been very clear that he believes that the United States neighbors, particularly of course Mexico and Canada, are not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants and drugs, specifically fentanyl from coming into the United States. But one thing that is clear is that Americans may at least temporarily be facing some of this pain early on. Now, one thing as well that is not clear, Jessica, is that when higher prices may actually come into effect, these tariffs are slated to be implemented starting 12:01 AM on Tuesday. And there's also really at this point, no real off ramp that we see for how Canada and Mexico specifically can respond in a way that would appease Donald Trump. He himself had said that on Friday there are no concessions and there wasn't really anything that these countries could do to change his mind or kind of stave off these tariffs.

And Elena, what are we hearing from leaders of China, Canada, and Mexico?

Well, we have heard from a number of these countries that they plan to retaliate. We actually heard from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself last night addressing this in response to the tariffs being signed, take a lesson,

Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against 155 billion worth of American goods. This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on 125 billion worth of American products in 21 days time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.

Now, Jessica, we also heard Trudeau say, quote, we don't want to be here. When addressing reporters last night about this, he also said that he had been trying to get in contact with the president in recent days, but that Trump had not returned his call. Now, similarly, we heard from Beijing, they said corresponding countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests will be placed in retaliation to these terrorists. We also heard Mexico's president, Claudia Scheinbaum say that she's instructing the Secretary of Economy to implement a plan B that they have been working on. She says it includes tariff and non tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interest. So we are likely to see these retaliation efforts from these different countries. One thing of course also notable is that in the tariffs in the fine print of what Donald Trump signed yesterday, there is a retaliation clause. That means that at any time, the president does have the right to raise these tariffs further if he believes these countries are responding in a way that he doesn't like

Jessica. Alright, Elena Trine with the very latest from West Palm Beach. Thank you very much for that. Business groups and corporate America taking aim at these tariffs, warning that they will hurt American families up in supply chains significantly hurt the relationship between all three countries and weakened US manufacturing the Wall Street Journal editorial board, putting it pretty bluntly, calling this the dumbest trade war in history. Joining us now seen in senior political analyst, Ron Brownstein. Ron, okay, let's just play devil's advocate for a second. What if all of this is wrong and what if Trump actually gets these countries to do what he wants and these tariffs go into effect and it is totally fine. Is that possible?

You basically have to repeal the law of economics for the tariffs to go into effect and have no impact, right? I mean, there's no question in the economic literature about who ultimately pays the price for tariffs. It's the consumers in the country imposing the tariffs. It's not clear what is the problem at the northern border that Trump is trying to solve in terms of migration and fentanyl and even at the southern border. It's not clear why this mechanism as opposed to negotiating with Mexico is a more effective to pursue the other policy goals that he's listing. I mean, Donald Trump was elected Jessica. The exit polling is very clear. For Trump voters, the number one issue was inflation. And now as he takes office with a conspicuous focus on other issues to begin with, not really any initiative other than arguing that energy, more energy production will bring down prices. He is moving in the opposite direction. I mean, right in time for the Super Bowl, a Trump tax on guacamole in effect, or a Trump tax on lumber from Canada that will push up the price of new housing construction. I mean, these are policies that are extremely high risk, not only for the economy, but for the administration politically.

You mentioned Canada. I spoke with the premier of Ontario last night, Doug Ford, I want to play a clip of what he said.

It's going to be terrible. It's going to make Americans poor. It's going to create inflation, it's going to make Canadians poor. It's going to really hurt both economies. And all we're saying is let's work together. Please do not lump us in with Mexico and China.

I thought that was, I watched that interview. I thought that was a somewhat strange line of argument because Mexico and Canada, I think have more chance to push back at this if they remain
United rather than Canada throwing Mexico under the bus. But look, I think when you consider the broad ramifications of this, I mean, Mexico is our largest supplier of fruits and vegetables, which will now be more expensive. Canada is our largest supplier of lumber for housing construction, which will now be more expensive. They are both integrated intensely into our domestic auto industry with parts and products moving back and forth across these borders regularly, that will now face the potential of substantial disruption. And that's before you even get to the issues of what can come from the retaliation. The American Farm Bureau, which is a pretty Trumpy organization, put out a statement worrying about the impact of this Mexico, Canada, and China account for half of our exports of farm goods. And even though Trump in his first term spent a lot of taxpayer money to basically pacify farmers by sending them checks, there was a long-term cost.
Some of the markets that we lost, particularly in China, have never come back. For example, for American soybeans, they've moved to other suppliers like Brazil. So this is a big gamble with the global economy, with the American economy, with the cost of living, which was, I think by any reasonable analysis, the principle issue that caused Donald Trump to win was the belief that Joe Biden had mismanaged inflation. Life was cheaper when Trump was president the first time, and therefore it would be cheaper when he's president Again. The tension, there was always that economists who looked at his program, particularly the tariffs and the mass deportation, always warned that it had the potential to rekindle inflation. And that may be the road he's heading down.

And the question becomes how flexible and how willing are people to go along with it. Ron Brownstein, thank you so much. We really appreciate it.

Thanks. Having."
3,cnn,"I think one of the big questions around all of this is how Americans will absorb this tariff, all the tariffs and any price hikes. So how are Americans feeling about this?

Yeah, I don't know if you could see me shaking my head here politically. I don't get it. I simply put, I don't get it because if we take a look here, Trump tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, the support is 38%. Now you don't have to be a mathematical genius to figure out that the 51% opposed is higher than the 38% support. Americans are saying, no, no, no. When it comes to these Trump tariffs, there've been some things that Trump has perhaps done in his early days that are popular. I've pointed those out, but this my dear friend, is not popular at all. I've looked at a bunch of polling data, some with vague polling language, some with more specifics like this one, and in every single one, the plurality or majority oppose the Trump tariffs and just this tiny bit right here, 38% south to 40% support 'em, Jessica.

So why do people appear to be against tariffs? I think I know the answer, but why?

But why? Sometimes I like the little layups and then I like to jump through them, right?

Alright, yeah. We all like to look smart like that. It's fine.

Exactly right. I love to look smart. It makes me look good in front of my mother. Look, tariff's effect on the US economy, just 34% say they're good. Get this. 47% say bad. How about on yourself, right? Your own economic. Look at this. Just 17% say good, 46% say bad. So you see very similar numbers on the bad effects that folks believe that the tariffs have on either the US economy or their own pocketbook. So folks think the tariffs are bad because simply put, they don't believe they work economically. And I think if you asked a lot of economists, they would agree with the American people on this

One. And what do Americans think about Trump making this one of his top priorities in his first 100 days?

Yeah. Okay. So I believe the Trump term number two began just 13 days ago. Alright, so Trump should focus on tariffs in his first a hundred days. Now Reuters Ipsos asked this question twice. When they asked it back in November of 2024, it was 1%. Look at that. It doubled all the way to 2% in December of 2024 when just 1% or 2% of Americans believe that you should be focusing, prioritizing an issue. Simply put, they want him focusing on the economy at large. They want him focusing on immigration. They don't want him focusing on tariffs. Look, Donald Trump did lay out his position on tariffs going in his election, but folks elected Donald Trump for different reasons, not for tariffs. They simply put, don't want him prioritizing it and simply put, do not like his issue positions on it.

And in his mind, the way he explains it, it helps with his top priority of immigration. He also believes that ultimately it makes America more prosperous. Of course, the question, the devil's in the details, we're going to have to see if that is actually what happens. But will Americans ultimately care? I mean, Trump has famously done a lot of things that are pretty unpopular and Americans elected him back to office.

Yeah, I think this is the big question and the honest to God truth is, I don't know, but take a look at weekly Google searches for terrorists get this. They're up 2400% versus a year ago. They've reached a 21 year high. There have been more searches for tariffs this week than for Taylor Swift. So when you're getting more people searching for tariffs than you are for anything related to Taylor Swift, you know the American people are paying attention and the fact that they don't like it and they're paying a lot of attention and they're searching for it, to me suggests that this is a political loser. The question will be whether or not folks penalize Trump for it, but they ain't going to reward him for it. Much better chance they penalize than reward him.

It will be interesting to see Harry Ton with the numbers for us as always. Thank you, Harry.

Thank you.

I don't expect anything very dramatic if we put tariffs on, they owe us a lot of money and I'm sure they're going to pay. We may have short term some little pain and people understand that. But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world.

By the way, that's not how tariffs work. They don't pay them. They're paid here in the United States. Let's get right to see an in senior White House reporter, Kevin Liptak for the latest on this, and the clock is ticking to the deadline, Kevin.

Yeah, and it's quite a striking acknowledgement from the president there that Americans could feel some discomfort from these tariffs. Essentially, he's saying that in order to fulfill his campaign promises on tamping down on illicit drugs and migrants coming across the border, another one of his campaign promises probably his top campaign promise, which was to lower prices for Americans, we'll just have to wait. And that's exactly what economists say might happen. And it's not only for big purchases like cars, this could affect small purchases as well. Things directly from Chinese manufacturers, from companies like Sheen and Tud. These could really have an effect on American's pocketbooks. And the President says that the tariff regime might not end here. Listen to what he said last night when he was asked whether additional tariffs could be coming for the United Kingdom and the European Union.

Well, we're going to see what happens. It'll happen, but we're going to Mike, we'll see how things work out. It might happen with that, but it will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us and UK is out of line, but I'm sure I think that one can be worked out. But the European Union is, it's an atrocity.

Now by and large, Trump has enjoyed the support from Republicans on those who are opposed to have mostly remained silent. One of the objections to that is Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. He wrote on social media that tariffs are simply taxes. He said that this could mean less trade and higher prices. Now he represents a state that could be directly affected by the reciprocal tariffs from Canada. They have gone after American liquor. Now Mexico says that they will announce their own reprisals today. China says that they will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. One of the big questions in all of this is what Canada and Mexico can actually do to have Trump ease up on these tariffs. It has never been explicitly clear what precise metrics he's using to curb the flow of migrants and fentanyl across the border over the weekend. Justin Trudeau says that he had been trying to reach Trump on the telephone since the inauguration, but his calls hadn't been picked up. Of course that will end today. But as you heard Trump say there any hopes for a last minute reprieve seem farfetched at this point.

And again, it is already having an impact with stock futures down oil prices up the opposite of what most economists and I think most Americans hope for on a day-to-day basis. Kevin Liptak, thank you very much for that.

And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau right behind you, because Canada is responding and responding quickly with tariffs of their own, the government announcing a full list of goods imported from the United States that would be taxed and the list is long. Everything from meats and cheese to appliances like fridges and stoves, the list will continue to go. Furniture, beauty, products, fruits, vegetables, spices, sugar, chocolate, the aforementioned alcohol that we were just hearing from Kevin Liptak, CNN's Paula Newton is tracking all of this for us and what Canada is saying about this all this morning. Good morning, Paula.

Good morning to you, Kate. I think Canadians have almost surprised themselves at the reaction here, Kate. It has been so visceral. So emotional words like betrayal being thrown around is if the United States had asked for a divorce and the reason they're not being alarmist either, Kate, the reason is what Kevin just said. They do not understand what the United States wants Now. They could have irritants in the trading relationship for sure. Get to the table, the Prime Minister's office is saying, and we will negotiate. But this seems different. And remember this was proceeded by joking or not all those musings by the president that Canada should become the 51st state. I want you to listen now to just some of the reaction.

I don't think there's a lot of Americans who wake up in the morning saying, ah, damn Canada

Conversations with Howard Lutnick and others in the administration tell me that perhaps in March there's a window again. But most of this is so unpredictable.

I mean, the president has decided now to make gas in the United States more expensive. He's decided to make groceries in the United States more expensive, and our retaliation is going to cost Americans jobs that it's completely ridiculous.

I think that's what's been so unnerving, is the fact that this will in fact hurt American consumers as well. And I'll look Kate, no one's saying that Canada would win a trade war with the United States. All Canada is saying is we don't want a war at all."
1,forbes,"Talking about tariffs on Canada and Mexico. 25%. That's coming on Saturday. That's coming on the first Saturday. But no oil tariff. No oil tariffs. No, I don't, well, I didn't say that you said that. No, I don't want to miss. No, we may or may not. We're going to make that determination probably tonight on oil, because they send us oil. We'll see. It depends on what the price is. If the oil is properly priced, if they treat us properly, we say down, look, Mexico and Canada have never been good to us on trade. They've treated us very unfairly in trade. And we will be able to make that up very quickly because we don't need the products that they have. We have all the oil you need. We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber. We have more than almost anybody in those two categories.
In oil. We have more than anybody, and we don't need anybody's trees. We have to free up some of the tree areas that we have. We have great lumber in this country. We have to free 'em up environmentally, which I can do very quickly, but we don't need what they have. And for us to be subsidizing Canada to the tune of 175 billion a year and subsidizing Mexico to the tune of 250 billion, 300 billion a year, and Mexico is a method of China sending in its product. And with China, I'm also thinking about something because they're sending Fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they're causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths. So China's going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we're in the process of doing that President. We'll make that determination of what it's going to be. But China has to stop sending Fentanyl into our country and killing our people. Mr. President."
2,forbes,"Impose tariff on the European Union.

What does that mean?

You're going to impose tariff too on European Union like you did, you're going to do for Mexico and Canada.

Well, you're asking me a question because I'm sure you didn't hear, am I going to impose tariffs on the European Union? Do you want the truthful answer or should I give you a political answer? Absolutely. Absolutely. The European Union has treated us so terribly.

You promised Americans to try to reduce costs, and so many of the products that would be tariffed when they come into the country, the outgoing country is not paying the tariff. The buyers in the United States pay that, and then that's passed on to consumers in most instances,

Sometimes

How?"
3,forbes,"Thank you, Mr. President.

Thank you.

This is hi Muto from on television. My question, let me ask a two quick, quick question.

Sure.

First, this is the first meeting between Mr. President and Prime Minister. So what kind of impression do you have on him? And number two, do you have an idea or do you have a plan to impose Tiff against Japan so far? Thank you.

I think that he is going to be a great prime minister. I think he's a very strong man, very, very strong. I have great respect for him. I've known him for a long time through a reputation Shinzo Abi thought the world of him, and I think he's going to do a fantastic job as Prime minister. Very strong person. I wish he wasn't so strong. I wish he was a little bit weaker than that, but that's what I got. I have to get strong guys all the time. He's going to be a great prime minister. I also, in terms of tariffs, I mean we're going to have tariffs, mostly reciprocal tariffs, where we go with, and I'm going to be probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday, have an announcement, probably a news conference, but probably reciprocal tariffs where a country pays so much or charges us so much and we do the same. So very reciprocal, because I think that's the only fair way to do it. That way. Nobody's hurt. They charge us, we charge them. It's the same thing. And I seem to be going in that line as opposed to a flat fee tariff. Okay."
4,forbes,"Okay. And then Japan. Are you okay with having a foreign country having a controlling interest in a US Steel company?

Well, let's look at this. When I came here, they were going to buy it and Biden was going to approve it. All of a sudden, Biden didn't because he heard I wasn't going to. I don't want US Steel being owned by a foreign country, but control the interest is okay. They have don't have a controlling, they have an investment. All they're going to have is an investment. Will it be a joint? I don't mind that investment in a company, but especially US Steel. US Steel for 15 years was the greatest company in the world, the greatest number one company in the world, and I'm not going to let another country buy. We had a great meeting of that, but they are allowed to invest in it and that's different.

Mr. President on Tariffs, sir, you've talked about reciprocal tariffs coming in this week. Can you tell us a little bit more about that and are you announcing a plan

For it? This? Yeah, I'll be announcing, I'll be announcing probably Tuesday or Wednesday at a news conference, reciprocal tariffs, and very simply it's if they charge us, we charge them. That's all. When does it go into impact, sir? Almost immediately, but I'll be announcing the details of it highly detailed and it'll be great for everybody, including the other countries, but if they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way. This is on every country. Every country will be reciprocal president. Can you confirm that? It won't affect everybody because there's somewhere we have similar tariffs, but the ones that are taking advantage of the United States, we're going to have a, it's reciprocity, it's reciprocal. We're going to have a reciprocal, but we'll have a news conference Tuesday or Wednesday.

Just on the steel question, just so I understand,

We'll also be announcing steel tariffs on Monday. Tomorrow. Monday, yeah, tomorrow. What countries will those go on? Everybody. Steel, including Canada, Mexico? Yeah. Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff. What about aluminum, sir? Aluminum tear, 10%. No, 25%. 25 for aluminum,

25 above both. And on steel, are you ruling out then If on steel having a 51% stake or higher, they won't have a majority stake?

Nobody can have a majority stake for US Steel. They can for other companies, but not for US. Steel. I think you agree with that. US Steel was one of our great companies and through a lot of stupidity and bad government and also bad management of the company, it lost that luster, but it's going to gain it back and tariffs are going to help. Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it is good management now too. Yeah."
1,fox_news,"Good afternoon everyone. I'm Charles Payne, and this is Making Money. Guess what we're going to do today? We're going to take a stroll down memory lane, tariff memory lane as the great Robert Frost would say. It genuinely is the road less traveled. You hear a lot about it, but you don't hear the facts about it, and let's just talk about most people. In fact, when it comes to history, this is the first historian. Think about this. Most people in fact will not take the trouble in finding out the truth, but are much more inclined to accept the first story that they hear. To Cides said this, and this is what we're hearing over and over again, the wrong story. So I'm going to talk specifically about, we have McKinley, right? In the McKinley era that was absolutely phenomenal. But I'm going to specifically talk about 1920. In 1921, the public was clamoring.
They were begging, demanding for higher tariffs, right? Why we had these new industries, the automobile and things like that. They wanted to protect that the economy was coming on. Our way of life was changing. We had the Emergency Tariff Act of 1921. That was followed by the Fort Ne Cucumber Act of 1922. And there were two specific principles, right? The scientific principle, this linked wages to the exporting country, right? And in effect, let's say China has cheaper labor than us. This made sure that this negated the fact that a country rather would have cheap labor. Then there was the American selling price. I love this one. If a product got here from a foreign country and it was cheaper than Americans, well, guess what? They made it more expensive. And by the way, the Fort Cucumber Act, those tariffs were the highest in history. The average 40%.
Some though, when as high as 400%. So what was the result? Let's talk about that for a moment, right? So a result of this act one result was an increase in spending by top tiers of American people, right? Americans had money. They weren't. They weren't in a foxhole. The American people, they were taxed less. Remember, all of what President Trump is doing also involves lower taxes. They were taxed less so they had more money to spend on American goods. What is meant by protectionism? It's an economic policy of the 1920s essential, and it was essential to trim the way to trim federal expenses. What are we trying to do now? We're trying to shrink the government. We're trying to bring it down. It's too big, it's too bureaucratic. If the deficit is too high, we're spending a trillion dollars a year just to service that beast.
And the way to do it was through these tariffs. And so these tariffs are absolutely phenomenal. In fact, they spark something that we now commonly call the roaring twenties, right? Look at this. Okay, so tariffs are bad. How could they be bad? We were going down here. This is the stock market. It was going down. We had the Emergency tariff Act, then we had the Ford number come, tariff act, and then bam, 500% climb in the stock market. Absolutely phenomenal. In fact, tariffs were working so well. Herbert Hoover, who was running for president, decided to make it essential part of his theme, but he specifically wanted to help American farmers. Now, here's the problem. The plan was hijacked, okay? The tariff schedule was flooded from the industrial sector. So yeah, we were going to help the American farmer. Then everyone jumped on board. Still, they went into effect.
We all know it. Now, as the Smoot Hawley Act went into effect, March 13th, 19th, 30. So what happened, right? I mean, every time someone comes on tv, they say, remember Smoot Hawley, inflation's going to go through the roof. You think prices skyrocketed back then? Absolutely not. In fact, it was the most extraordinary deflationary spiral in American history. This is it. This is Smoot Hawley folks. The 1930s deflation, it wasn't inflation. Prices went down. They didn't go up. So it's really every time someone comes on and says, prices are going to go up, look, atmo, Hawley, I looked at it. So let's fast forward. President Trump's first term in office. He implemented these tariffs, right? So you go back 2018, you have the yellow line. That's inflation for us. Personal consumption. Inflation goes down the blue line, tariffs go up. The only time inflation went up was covid.
That was the response to Covid folks. This had zero to do with tariffs. Now I know Wall Street and the financial media, they're slavishly just committed to short-term corporate profits, right? Here's the problem. We cannot win the future if everything we measure is measured in quarterly times, not every 90 days. That's the corporate sector. The bottom line, it's time for a longer game for longer prosperity for all Americans. That's the true story about tariffs. That's the story you need to learn is ignore what you hear of financial media or anyone else. Now, of course, there were three things that we've always had with these big periods of prosperity, tariff, tough immigration policies, and emerging technology. It has to come from American technology dominance. And of course, we know this week it took a real serious blow with the unveiling of deep seek. So I want to show you last Friday, the max seven stocks were trading really nice and high and big.
And of course they got hammered on Monday, and I had a chart for it, but vanished. So we fast forward to today, and Michael Hartnett at Bank of America just published a note and it read that in part US exceptionalism is peaked. He talks about tailwinds and spending. He talks about immigration in a negative way. Again, this is Wall Street saying, Hey, you know what? The bubble is fading investors all in American exceptionalism. Now they're missing all kinds of great opportunities elsewhere. You should be investing in Japan. You should be investing in Europe because the American exceptionalism is out. Our dominance in technology is over. Well, I don't agree."
2,fox_news,"On our side, we will be implementing 25% tariffs on US products. Canadians are perplexed, I think, disappointed. We view ourselves as your neighbor, your closest friend, your ally.

Canada and Mexico are upping the ante as they counter president Trump's new tariffs with tariffs of their own. China is threatening the US with retaliatory measures as well. For more on this, let's bring in Fox business contributor Jonathan Honig. Jonathan, thanks for joining us. And you see Canada and Mexico saying dollar for dollar. We're going to counter you. Where do you come down in the debate over whether or not the president's tariffs now enacted are going to be successful or whether they're going to make things worse? The Wall Street Journal just eviscerating this decision saying it makes no sense.

Yeah, I mean, well, they aren't just threats anymore, Griff, right? This isn't just in a negotiating tool. These are now in place and the president has some really ambitious goals. He's talked about curtailing illegal immigration, curtailing drugs. The fact is that tariffs are taxes. You can't evade that there are taxes paid by American importers. One of the effects that we know is that it will raise costs for American consumers. Yale had a number out over the weekend, estimating at about a loss of about $1,200 in household income per year because of the tariffs. And even Trump himself, Griffith admitting that Americans will feel some pain. And there's historical examples of this in the first term. For example, the tariffs on washing machines raised the price of washing machines about $90 a unit. So there's a lot of impacts that were not even going to be seen. Tax foundation is estimating about 344,000 jobs lost as a result of these tariffs. Four tenths of 1% of GDP. The fact is, Griff, that we import a lot of goods, three fourths of all fruit is imported and about one in five pairs of shoes. So lots imported and lots going to be

Effect. Jonathan, you say that the president says there will be pain. Here's what he says in a truth social post here today, taking on the Wall Street Journal, namely saying, make your product in the USA and there are no tariffs. Why should the US lose trillions of dollars in subsidizing other countries? And why should these other countries pay a small fraction of the cost of what USA citizens pay for drugs and pharmaceuticals as an example. This will be the golden age of America. Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not so, maybe not. Here's my question for you, Jonathan. And I think the argument that President Trump is trying to say to critics like yourself, don't miss the forest for the trees because his entire plan, which includes increasing energy production, deregulation for business tax cuts, and the tariffs to balance the playing field, is going to be counter inflationary and ultimately lead in what he calls this golden age. That's his pushback. What say you?

Well, I tell you, a brand new world. What we know, Griff, is that many Americans, many American companies, are not just warning about the tariffs. I mean, whether it be the retailers, I said, the shoemakers, steel workers, United auto workers, all warning against the tariffs warning there'll be higher prices. What we're seeing is that bull market in lobbying, I mean, every lobbyist is now working in full bloom looking for exemption. So one thing we know is that the tariffs will breed more corruption, more payoffs, more payola, more chicanery. So as I said, president Trump has amazing, ambitious goals. We'd like to see them achieved, but it's unclear, at least to many economists, whether tariffs, taxes on Americans will achieve those goals.

Let's talk about the auto. We hear a lot about the pain Americans in the short term Mayfield in regards to the auto industry with both Canada and Mexico. What does that look like for us in the near future and potentially over a course of months if this continues?

Well, so often auto parts, elements of the McGriff are manufactured in Canada, manufactured in the us, manufactured in Mexico, then shipped from place to place. So the supply chain that powers the American economy is so multifaceted. It's so fascinating. It's so intricate that something like this about attacks on trade writ large has such wide ranging effects. And the famous economist, Baat always talked about that, which is seen and that which is unseen. So this will, as I said, have such far reaching impacts, and that's why CEOs big and smaller, scrambling to look at their supply chains. You might see people, let's say, move out of importing from China, but we could see, for example, imports from Vietnam, pickup as well, Grif. So there's going to be a lot of supply chain rejiggering, and it's really difficult to tell what the net result will be from these new tariffs, these new taxes. As I said, it's a brave new world. We haven't seen tariffs like this in decades in America.

Well, and what's fascinating to me, and this is really my last question for you, Jonathan, and great insight as always, but it was Trump that got rid of nafta, created the U-S-M-C-A. If his intention now is to bring his Canadian and Mexican partners back to the table to do a different UMCA, would that not be something that he's already gained by bringing him willingly or unwillingly to that table?

Sure. I mean, shoot, would it be great? Would it be ideal? I think from the market's perspective, Griff would be to lower taxes, lower tariffs across the board. Not only Canadian tariffs, Mexican tariffs, but also American tariffs as well. Interestingly, this recent order from the president violates the order that he cited in his previous term. He said it goes against it. So oil always say that the market hates uncertainty. And we saw a massive fall off on Friday when these tariffs were announced. There's a lot of uncertainty among American manufacturers, many companies, entire business model, surrounded by importing low cost. So there's a lot of scurrying, a lot of uncertainty as a result of these tariffs. And as they continue to get rolled out, and of course, as the retaliation continues to roll in, the economy's going to be roiled.

Well, you're right about one thing for sure. Jonathan. Markets don't like instability and uncertainty, and we shall see what the markets do tomorrow morning. Jonathan Hoig, great insight as always. Thank you. Thank you."
3,fox_news,"Joining me now. Peter Navarro, white House counselor for trade and manufacturing. Peter, great to have you on tonight. The faces,

It's, see you, Laura.

The faces in the crowd today were hilarious As Vice President Vance spoke about a relationship with Europe. Now Europe is threatening reciprocal tariffs. I know you've heard the comments from Germany and France, your reaction tonight to what they heard from you all yesterday regarding tariffs.

Hey, here's an idea. The EU runs like hundreds of billions of dollars of a trade surplus every year. When do they use that money to pay for nato? Hey, there's an idea. Stop the corporate welfare. The fact is, Laura, they cheat us. You know how many cars they sell us versus how many we sell them. They got a VAT tax, a value added tax that works just like a tariff, that they've been sticking this to us for years and it's such an imbalanced trade relationship. And what Donald Trump's going to do is he's going to level the playing field, make it fair again, both for national defense and economic security reasons. The steel and aluminum tariffs we did this week are a great start to that. And by the way, the EU is a tremendous part of the capacity over capacity we have in steel and aluminum and they're dumping it. They're governments are responsible and like a billion euros here, three billionaire subsidizing these steel and aluminum industries to attack the United States. So these bureaucrats in the crowd, Laura, they don't know what hit him. I mean, Donald Trump is moving so fast, he float like a butterfly, sting, like a be

Peter on the issue of trade and steel versus aluminum. We know the steel manufacturing is so critical to America's future, and that's just without a doubt. But the aluminum industry is a little bit different because we only have a few smelters left in the United States. Most of the dirty work is done up in Canada. There are some new technologies I know out there that are emerging that we may or may not support down the road, but why would 25% on aluminum make sense? When last time, I think you all put what, 10% on aluminum, but now it's up to 25. Trying to figure that

Out. Well, the problem we had when we put the tariffs on in 20 18, 20 5% for steel, 10% for aluminum. They worked beautifully at the time, but what the Biden regime did was give all these country exemptions and product exclusions and capacity utilization as few foundries as we have is down to 50% when it needs to be up at 80. You make your own case lower. We lost two foundries, two big foundries during the Biden years. We can't afford to do that. Remember, in times of crisis, we have to depend on steel and aluminum for our defense needs. So President Trump is fully confident that a 25% tariff will be enough to bring back significant investment here, both domestic investment and foreign investment.

Peter, we cannot wait to see the heads continuing to explode as the tariff thing plays out. Great to have you back on the show, Peter. Thank you so much."
1,nbc_news,"Tariffs are the most beautiful word. I think they're beautiful. It's going to make us rich.

Tariffs are a major part of President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy and economic agenda.

We want fairness from other countries. We have not been treated fairly, and we're going to get fairness

Put simply. Tariffs are attacks on goods from another country paid by the company importing them usually to protect national industries or as a trade negotiation tool. Quick history lesson In the US tariffs started out steep.

You can say there were three distinct periods of tariff history at the United States from say, 1790 to 1860 when tariffs were the main source of federal revenue. Something like 90% of all federal revenues was based on taxing imports from the Civil War to the Great Depression of the 1930s. We had tariffs for protection. Tariffs were raised a very high levels on a variety of imports, and basically those industries were protected.

But that changed. In the mid 1930s,

Policymakers decided that high tariffs were not really good for the American economy. So from the 1930s all the way up to now, we've had a progressively lower and lower tariffs.

In 2018, president Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, an effort to reduce the trade deficit and boost US manufacturing. The Biden administration kept most of these tariffs, and in some cases even raise them on $18 billion of Chinese goods. Though the move is said to be largely symbolic.

The 2018 tariffs do appear as best economists can judge things to have raised the price level by one to 2%.

Larry Summers is former US Treasury Secretary under Democratic President, bill Clinton. He says the tariffs were not effective. The

Evidence is that they made a small contribution to inflation. Tariffs tend to make the people in the countries who impose them poorer because they raise the price of what they buy, and that makes paychecks go less far.

But others like Orrin Caste, chief Economist at Conservative think tank, American Compass, say tariffs ultimately benefit the economy.

What we saw in 2018 when President Trump first imposed a lot of tariffs was there were some places where there was an effect on prices. A lot of times that was short-lived. When we do collect tariffs, if people do have to pay more, that's tax revenue that goes to the government. We can use that to reduce other taxes. We can use that to reduce our deficit. We can use that to actually support the creation of more manufacturing here in the United States.

While the efficacy of tariffs is still widely debated, their international reach is indisputable. After President Trump's tariffs on China in 2018, the country retaliated with tariffs of its own on US goods. Now in 2025, Mexico is threatening to do the same. After President Trump said he would impose strict tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada.

I think we may be in the midst of a sort of third big change in US tariff policy.

And that's tariffs simply explained.

Thanks for watching. Stay updated about breaking news and top stories on the NBC News app, or follow us on social media."
1,sixty_minutes,"You don't know Robert Lighthizer, but his influence with President Trump could change America's economy. Lighthizer was the top US trade negotiator in the first Trump administration, and he's an evangelist for tariffs taxes on imported goods. Yesterday, the president declared an emergency and imposed unusually high 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10% on China to coerce them to stop the flow of the deadly drug. Fentanyl. That's unusual because tariffs are normally used to balance trade and in light's opinion, America has little choice. He says China's three to one dominance in trade is a threat to our way of life.

The story will continue in a moment.

China, to me, is an existential threat to the United States. It is a very, very competent adversary. China views itself as number one in the world and wants to be that way. They view us as in the way they have the biggest army in the world and they're growing it, the biggest Navy in the world, and they're growing it. They're spying on us. They're taking our technology. They've been waging an economic war against the United States and winning that war for at least the last three decades.

So your tariff regime for China would be what?

I believe in strategic decoupling. I'm not saying no economic relationship with Sean. That's not my position at all. I think you want balanced trade and how do you get balanced trade? You're going to get balanced trade by having large tariffs on most of what they send to us.

What's large?

The president has floated numbers 50, 60%, but I think big numbers like that.

Wait a minute. You're talking about decoupling from China. What would that look like?

So it's strategic decoupling, so we would still have trade. So I would say we sell you 150 billion. We buy 150 billion from you. No more. We don't allow investments in China except in circumstances where we believe that's in the interest of the United States. We don't allow inbound investments, so we begin to disentangle. We disentangle our technology. You can ask yourself, what is China's policy towards us? It is exactly a mere image of what I just said, so what I'm suggesting we do to China is what they do to us.

Ronald Reagan gave the young trade lawyer his first White House job and 77-year-old Bob Lighthizer has been advising Republicans since in Trump's first term, Lighthizer was in charge of negotiating trade agreements in Trump 2.0. He's an unofficial advisor, but a passionate one. We noticed when he apologized for chewing up time,

Just because I talk too much,

It's 60 minutes after

All of it and we don't get all of it. It's not 60 days. Is that what you're thinking?

It's not days, but centuries that tariffs have been debated. Every US president has used them, but in the 1930s, tariffs deepened the Great Depression, and after World War ii, America led a broken world toward free trade. US manufacturing jobs were stable until around the year 2000. Then in 10 years, a third of manufacturing jobs were lost nearly 6 million. There was a modest rebound under Obama, Trump and Biden. That dip is covid, but fewer than one and a half million jobs are back.

You don't know how much you love going to work until you can't go there anymore.

Stacey dah, Michelle Lopez and Matt Franson are among 1200 workers laid off in 2023 when the Belvedere Illinois Auto Assembly plant shut down.

This is my home, and when they told me that we were done, it hurt. It really did.

We've got a community of 24,000 people and there's probably not a street you can go down that somebody's not tied to this plant. We've been here since 1965. It's a good job, provides a great living, and we would just like to see it come back.

Come back from Mexico. In 2016, carmaker Stellantis moved one of Belvedere Jeep models south of the border in 2023, Belvedere closed.

We've lost electronics. We've lost textiles. We've lost chemicals in a large way. We invented the semiconductor. Now we make 8% of semiconductors for the world and none of the really high tech ones, more than half of the car sold in America are now imports.

Mexico, Canada, and China. Our America's largest trading partners, but China, Bob Lighthizer says, has an enormous advantage because of the trade imbalance and Chinese espionage stealing us trade secrets.

You add it all up, you can get to around a trillion dollars a year of wealth from the United States being transferred through a geopolitical adversary. It's insane and it's working. And then you ask yourself with the national security issue, how do you fight a war? If God help us, we ever have a war with China, we're there now four times more likely to be able to produce what is needed in a warden,

But isn't trade one of the ways we avoid a hot war?

The way you prevent wars is by having the strongest, biggest, best army, biggest best Navy, best economy in the world, best technology. You do those things. The allies come to you. They see you as the future.

Already, China's manufacturing sector is bigger than that of the United States, Germany and Japan combined. Isn't China too big to snub?

We should never have that attitude. There are things we can do. The genius of America combined with our allies. We can turn this around, but what do we need? We need to change the relationship with them. We need tariffs in my judgment. We need subsidies in certain areas and we need an economic policy and a military strategic policy that rises up to the challenge.

Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive

On the campaign. Trump propose historic tariffs, 10 to 20% on all imports, 25% on Mexico and Canada, 60% on China. He said America would grow wealthy collecting taxes from overseas.

A tariff is a tax on a foreign country. That's the way it is. Whether you like it or not, a lot of people like to say, oh, it's a tax on us. No, no, no. It's a tax on a foreign country. It's a tax on a country that's ripping us off and stealing our jobs.

But most, any importer or economist will tell you the president is mistaken. Tariffs are not a tax on a foreign country. The tax is paid by the importer in the United States. For example, Walmart imports goods from China, and when those goods cross into the United States, Walmart pays the tariff. If Walmart decides to pass the cost to consumers, then you paid the tariff, not China.

So if you go to Walmart, if you go to Target, you're going to see higher prices for imported goods.

Economists, Mary, lovely studied Trump's proposals for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a leader in nonpartisan research. The argument is made that if tariffs are imposed, American consumers will buy less of the foreign goods, more domestically produced goods, and that's a great thing for consumers and for jobs.

Well, it's a great thing for consumers. If you don't care about how much they are able to buy because the prices of everything they buy will go up, will they substitute toward domestic goods? Let's just take that to start. Yes, to some extent they will, but the prices of those domestic goods will also rise because they no longer have to compete with imported goods.

Lovely's research estimates the tariffs Trump talks about would cost an average household around $200 a month.

Footwear, toys, home goods, certain types of machinery, certain active ingredients in pharmaceuticals, certain types of chemicals. We're still very dependent in certain categories,

But worse, lovely says tariffs can kill jobs. She points to Trump's first term tariffs on imported steel as intended steel prices rose, US mills were protected, but the higher prices hurt steel buyers like car makers. Economists estimate that the tariffs created 1000 jobs in steel, but cost 75,000 jobs among US companies overall,

This idea that it creates jobs, yes, in a few places for a few people, but for the majority of us, it's more pressure on employers. It's more pressure on our wages, it's more pressure on our jobs, and obviously more pressure on our wallets when we go to the cash register.

The argument is made that when you increase the cost of parts and supplies coming into the country, you're hurting Apple, you're hurting Ford, you're hurting American companies.

Will these very highly paid CEOs have to figure out how to make a profit in a new environment, one that helps workers and helps innovation and is more American focused America first? The answer is, yeah, they're going to have to figure it out. Will they figure it out? Of course. They'll figure it out. They're going to learn how to make money.

One of the ways they figure it out is by laying people off.

Well, no, you see, I don't believe that's true. I think to me, the exact opposite will happen. You will see more production in the United States. You will see more jobs, better jobs, more pressure, upward pressure on wages, which is my objective.

The way you paint it, it seems like tariffs are magic.

Well, I wouldn't say magic. Remember, the tariffs are part of an economic policy. The policy has tax cuts, it has spending cuts. It has energy reduction, it's regulatory reduction, and it has tariffs. The combination of that, I think, and tariffs are an important part of it, has the potential to have this kind of renaissance.

We saw some of that combination. He talks about back in Belvedere, where turbo charged tariffs have been hitched to a big taxpayer investment. When you were putting that t-shirt on, Joe Biden, did you think that's it? The plant's opening again. In 2023, Matt Franson, president of the UAW local welcomed President Biden to Belvedere with a union shirt.

I thought we were well on our way. Belvedere has always fought for themselves, and in this scenario, we needed everybody to fight for us, and they did.

Biden did. He increased Trump's earlier 25% tariff on Chinese cars to 100% for Chinese electric vehicles. Then Biden gave car makers Stellantis a $335 million grant to convert Belvedere to electric cars. We don't know how much that helped, but last month Stellantis said it would reopen in 2027.

They need to realize that whether you're democrat, republican, independent, we need to work on the middle class. If the middle class is strong, that helps so many different areas. So it's not just going to be the tariffs. It's got to be policy that's set for the middle class.

But tariffs cut both ways. Canada and Mexico now say they will retaliate against Trump's new tariffs with their own tariffs on US goods, the opening shots of a trade war.

The real fear that I have is that we have real problems, and I'm afraid that tariffs time and time again, proven to not deliver. So in the long run, I'm afraid it will just increase cynicism among the American public about whether the government is able to deliver and make their lives better.

What are the chances that you're wrong?

Well, once again, we tried it the other way, Scott, if we do this in 10 years, it doesn't work. We can go back and always fail again with the way we have in the past."
1,sky_news,"Another day, another set of tariffs. This time around, it's still an aluminum, aluminum as they call it in America. And lemme just give you the big picture here, starting with aluminum. This is showing you just how much each country around the world produces. It goes all the way back to 1900. That's the US okay? So it used to be one of the world's biggest producers, other countries have since caught up and actually overtaken it. So Canada that's in front partly down to the fact that it takes a lot of power to make aluminum. You are refining it with electricity, it's kind of electrolysis and there's a lot of hydro in Canada, so that's pretty clean aluminum. But the big picture here, you need to zoom out the big picture is something else. Have a look at this. The big picture is China. Okay? So Chinese production has gone through the roof and China has been pumping out loads of aluminum around the world.
And that's part of the picture here. And when you look at just how to what extent the US is dependent on other countries around the world, the higher line is the more dependent America is on imports. That is now well above or it's been above 50%, it's nearly 50% at the moment. It's around that point, which down from really low levels previously. So American independence in producing aluminum's, no longer the case. However worth just saying, I showed you that China chart a moment ago you might've thought, is that all China? Well, no, this is showing you where aluminum comes to the US from, and China's actually only a small part of it by far and away the biggest part, the biggest importer into the us. It's Canada. To the extent that actually when people talk about the North American market, they usually include Canada in it.
But obviously if Canada's going to be hit by that, that's going to be a really big deal. Indeed. What kind of things is aluminum amused for? Well, it goes into a lot of things. It goes into transportation. So you're talking about planes. So it's light, it's a light. Strong metal, inter planes into trains, into automobiles, particularly electric vehicles, but other things as well. Containers, cans obviously for soft drinks. And the issue here is if you are pushing up the cost of aluminum that you are importing and it's very hard produce to get those smelters going overnight, then the cost of all of this stuff, all of those components into it goes up. And that's the issue. Potential big inflation in the US as a result of this. And all of those goods go up as well worth saying with steel. So I showed you that chart a moment ago looking at aluminum production, same thing here, okay, for steel, there's the UK as well as the us The picture is basically the same.
China has gone through the roof recently. Massive increase in Chinese production. And again, have a look at this chart. This is showing you that dependence and here it's a subtly different story. So whereas the US has become much more dependent on imports when it comes to aluminum with steel, much less so actually that's much lower when it comes to import dependence. So in other words, the US able to deal with higher costs of steel, imported steel slightly more than when it comes to aluminum. That's an interesting difference here, but there is a big story here and the big story is I'll show you those charts of Chinese production going through the roof. As a result of that, everyone is finding it hard to compete. And when you look at just how much it costs to make steel aluminum in China, it's relatively low, partly because energy costs are low, partly because there are big subsidies for producing things like aluminum.
The high these bars are the more state aid there is that subsidies and aluminum's there, steel is there as well, as well as all sorts of other things like semiconductors, solar panels, cement production as well. And as a result it is really hard to compete. Some people call this over capacity and a really good illustration of this actually comes back to electric cars. This is showing you how much domestic sales for electric cars are in China. Actually it's all domestic sales of all cars. And this is showing you how much domestic production is. Okay? So production within China is projected to go higher and higher and higher. And you can see that when you are get producing more cars than you're actually able to consume, then you are pumping them out around the world. And that's the concern that's happening. Not just with ATE vehicles but with everything else as well.
And that's part of the story behind these subsidies, one presumes, but there's a big impact here as well. Have a look at this. This shows you who the UK still exports still to. We don't make that much still. We really don't all that much, but we do export quite a lot to the US of that smaller amounts of steel, high production, high quality pieces of steel that is going to be impacted. Obviously if there aren't going to be restrictions to these tariffs, but we'll have to see. We just don't know. And we're taking it with all of these policies basically one day at a time."
1,wsj,"President Trump is slapping stiff tariffs on America's top three trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China.

They owe us a lot of money, and I'm sure they're going to pay.

Trump is imposing a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on imports from China. Mexico's president negotiated with Trump at the last minute putting the tariffs on Mexico on hold for a month. Meanwhile, Canada is planning retaliation.

Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs.

Here's how Trump's new tariffs are different, and why many economists and politicians say you the consumer might have to pay the price to measure the impact. Let's look at the numbers. The US imported roughly $893 billion worth of goods from Mexico and Canada in 2023. Nearly all of those imports will now have a 25% tariff, meaning if an American importer wants one of their goods, they'll have to pay that tariff to the US government.

Consumers will likely notice this quite quickly in the cost of fresh produce at the grocery store.

Almost all of America's raspberry, strawberry and avocado supply comes from Mexico, as well as most of the country's supply of beer and tequila and mezcal. On the other side, the US gets about 80% of its frozen French fries, 70% of its lumber and 60% of its meat will syrup from Canada.

It's a really big deal because at the moment, we really don't have tariffs on any goods coming from Mexico and Canada under the free trade agreements that we have in North America.

In fact, 99% of America's natural gas imports come from Canada. On February 1st, Trump announced a 10% tariff on Canada's energy products. Trump's tariffs risk pushing Mexico and Canada into recession, as both nations send 80% of their exports into the us. But Canada is planning precision strikes against US exports, and the impact of that could be contrary to what Trump claims.

The tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong.

Since Canada has a much smaller economy, it can impose the same impact on the us. But Canada is betting that if it causes enough disruption, Trump who campaigned on lowering prices after a period of elevated inflation will back down

Like the American tariffs. Our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine, and bourbon.

Mexico's president struck a deal with Trump for a one month pause on US tariffs on Mexico. In return, she agreed to deploy 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border to fight fentanyl trafficking

In Mexico.

China also signaled that it's eager to get trade talks going with Trump. While it's unclear what will happen next, experts say a trade war between the US and its largest trading partners would hit US income, hurt, employment, and increase inflation. So if all of that is true, why is Trump so keen to use tariffs?

Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. And number three are the massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits.

I think most people do see Trump using these tariffs as a bargaining tool. He wants something out of Canada and Mexico.

The White House said the duties would remain in place until Mexico, Canada, and China stopped that null smuggling and illegal migration. But there are some industries that might benefit

The US steel industry and domestic aluminum producers have been asking Trump to raise more tariffs against imported steel and aluminum. They say Mexican factories have been dumping a lot of very low cost steel and aluminum in the US against commitments that Mexico has made over the years and that those low cost imports have undermined US producers who have higher costs and forced them to idle or close factories.

It's unclear how long Trump plans to lead these tariffs on. Some experts say that decision will be the biggest measure of its impact.

If the companies feel that Trump is just leaving these on short term in order to get something out of Canada and Mexico, they're not going to rip up their manufacturing footprint.

At the center of all of this is the US Mexico Canada agreement.

Our own Wall Street Journal reporting has shown that some of Trump's aids say that he's actually pushing both Mexico and Canada to renegotiate the free trade agreement that we do have

And these tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China might just be the beginning.

Eventually, we're going to put tariffs on chips. We're going to put tariffs on oil and gas. We're going to be putting tariffs on steel and aluminum and ultimately copper.

We also expect to see some confusion and probably delays at the borders. We could see goods backing up in warehouses as different trading partners try to sort through the new rules. So all of that is probably ahead in the coming days and weeks."
2,wsj,"When it comes to tariffs, president Donald Trump really looks up to

President McKinley like a lot. William McKinley, William McKinley, William McKinley, highly underrated. He has not been properly recognized. William McKinley as an example, he was a big tariff president. He was a strong believer in tariffs.

McKinley did oversee one of the biggest tariff bill's in US history.

He was the tariff king.

He called himself

A tariff man standing on a tariff

Platform. But in his second term, he basically abandoned that platform.

It really changes his mind in some sense and wants to shift the focus of trade policy away from protectionism and isolationism and allow for more international trade as a way of helping the US economy.

Here's how McKinley used tariffs, how Trump is following a similar playbook and why McKinley actually came to speak out against them. This is Doug Irwin. He literally wrote the book on the history of tariffs, and he said they can be classified into three main objectives.

The three Rs of trade policy are revenue restriction and reciprocity

Throughout McKinley's career. Tariffs were used for each of these at one point, and Trump wants to use all three too. The first one, revenue is the oldest use for tariffs in the us. Trump says this chart shows how tariffs created vast wealth for our country and how tariffs will make America wealthy. Again, it's the percent of all government revenue that comes from tariffs. For the last 70 years, it's hung around 2%, but 200 years ago, it was nearly a hundred.

We were very much an agrarian society with most people being farmers, and so import tariffs were just sort of an efficient way of raising revenue.

During the Civil War, the government started using excise taxes like we still have today, taxes on alcohol and gasoline. Even those made in the us and McKinley's story really starts around here in the 1880s when the US collected about half its revenue from tariffs, too much revenue, actually, the US had a huge surplus and had basically paid off all the Civil War debt. It was actually

A big problem, a problem like I hoped to have with this country someday. Our country was so rich we didn't know what to do with all the money we had.

No, really, it was like a problem.

If you've paid off all the debt, there's no reason to run a fiscal surplus because then the government's just accumulating money, the people's money and not spending it. It is just sitting in government coffers and in government safes. So what's the point of that?

So the tariff question was the alligator monster sized problem for Congress at the time. What rate should tariffs be in order to bring in less money and reduce the surplus? Congress ultimately decided that they should be higher. The debate was on this, what we now call the Laffer Curve. It shows the relationship between how high the tax rate is and how much revenue it brings. In this case from imports, they both wanted to get the revenue down to this range. Democrats wanted to lower the tariff rates so that they'd bring in less revenue on imported goods.

The Republicans said that's insanity. If you cut the tariff rates, you're going to encourage more imports. That's going to generate more revenue and it'll exacerbate the problem. So what you have to do is raise tariff rates to squeeze out imports, and then the revenue will go away.

Or as McKinley put it, if you increase them enough, you diminish importations and to that extent diminish the revenue. He, by the way, wasn't president.

All tax legislation has to start in the house ways and means committee who's chair of the house ways and means committee. William McKinley, a representative from the state of Ohio,

Which is why these tariff increases became known as the McKinley Tariffs, and they had one other goal restriction, or as it was called back then, protectionism

In the words of President McKinley, who is the tariff king? The protective system invokes the highest law of nature, self preservation.

Sometimes you don't want the revenue. You want to restrict imports from coming in from hurting domestic industries, and therefore you're just trying to keep imports out.

The McKinley tariffs raise the rate of imports on growing American industries, wool fabrics and yarn, and especially tin plate, which was used for just about everything back then. As McKinley put it. The point was to make the cost of foreign tin plate high enough to ensure its manufacturer in this country. It worked. Tin plate prices did go up at first because that's what happens when you raise tariffs, but so did us production. It boomed. Meanwhile, tin plate imports went down,

And so this gave tariff proponents a great success story to point to.

The protective tariff policy of the Republicans has been made and made the lives of our countrymen sweeter and brighter.

And those fewer imports meant that the other goal was accomplished too. It lowered tariff revenue, which lowered the surplus. But then

Most of the 1890s we were mired in this recession.

It had more to do with being on the gold standard than the tariffs, but the tariffs effect voters directly. They see prices go up

In people's minds. It was associated with that, and so they punished the Republican party. As a result.

Republicans lost the 1892 midterms badly. Even McKinley was out of office after a stint as Ohio governor. He won the 1896 presidential election, and as President McKinley began to think about using tariffs for their third purpose, reciprocity, he had Congress as part of another tariff package, give him the authority to reduce tariffs on just a few items so he could negotiate trade agreements. I'll lower my tariffs if you lower yours. By the end of his first term, the economy was dramatically different from when he was a congressman. Manufacturing output of US industries was rising fast, and the US was taking in less than half of its revenue from tariffs.

World economy is beginning to undergo a boom. American manufacturers, they're really good. They've sort of saturated the domestic market, and so we need foreign markets to sort of vent our surplus, and you're not going to export to the world if you are a very closed, protected economy. You have to open up

By his second term. He believed that was the future. At the big Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, McKinley gave a surprising speech to a crowd of tens of thousands. The former self-described tariff man said, the period of exclusiveness is passed. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times. Measures of retaliation are not if per chance, per

Chance. Some of our tariffs are no longer needed for revenue or to encourage and protect our industries at home. Why should they not be employed to extend and promote our markets abroad? So what he's basically saying there is that we don't need the revenue so much, and we don't need the protection against foreign competition. Why can't we use the tariff as a way of inducing other countries to open up their markets and achieve reciprocity? For him to propose this is really a dramatic step,

We'll never know if he would've followed through and made more trade agreements. The very next day. He was shot by an anarchist and later died. Vice President Teddy Roosevelt took office.

Theodore Roosevelt didn't have as strong views on the tariff as McKinley did. He wasn't as much of an expert, and he didn't push the way McKinley, I think, would've pushed for this new direction in trade policy.

Just a decade later, Democrats switched to an income tax system and tariffs were used sparingly, really just for restrictions on small, specific industries. But now tariffs are back.

The tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong.

President Trump has said he plans to use tariffs for all three Rs,

And we will use the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff dollars to benefit the American citizens and pay down our debt. We will make our own products and we will buy far less from foreign countries than we are buying right now, but we're going to have a reciprocal tax and we're going to charge them the same.

But these objectives can't all be accomplished at once.

If you really want to restrict imports, keep them out of the US market. Well, you can't really use that as a bargaining chip, and if you're trying to raise revenue, you can't have the rates too high and restrict access to the market because revenue is based on imports coming in. So you can't really achieve all three at the same time.

The White House didn't comment on where Trump's fascination with McKinley began, but said, the President is reviewing his options of balancing increasing revenue while restricting imports, but tariffs have never been used at a McKinley level in a modern day economy.

Today, we have integrated supply chains where all the component parts and the component raw materials are part of this very complex multi-country movement. And so tariffs are a little bit more disruptive today, perhaps a lot more disruptive today because there's so many chains to international commerce.

Now, Trump might take the mantle as the new

Tariff king, and I don't think he was as bad as I am. I think I believe in him even more than him."
1,wusa,"Trump begins a new week in his efforts to remake the federal government. He announced today plans to impose new tariffs starting tomorrow. Trump is making history tonight. He's the first sitting commander in chief to attend the Super Bowl. This is video of the president going out onto the field and taking pictures with law enforcement before the beginning of the game. Willie James Inman has that story from West Palm Beach, Florida.

Tonight, president Donald Trump is set to become the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. Trump says he'll announce on Monday that the United States will impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum and ports, including from Canada and Mexico.

Tariff. Trump's stop in New Orleans begins a new week as his administration undertakes a dramatic overhaul of the federal government. With the help of billionaire Elon Musk Trump is putting multiple departments and agencies under the cost cutting microscope. The president spoke about the initiatives, several of which are being challenged in court. We're

Talking about fraud, waste, abuse, and when a president can't look for fraud and waste and abuse, we don't have a country anymore.

So far more than 65,000 federal workers have taken the Trump administration's proposed buyout. According to the US Office of Personnel Management, the administration's intense focus on U-S-A-I-D is sparking debate between Republicans and Democrats.

I certainly think the government is far too big, far too bloated, and we're on a path now to start to see its shrink. This is the first step only, but we're moving in the right direction.

We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution in honoring Congress's role in the creation of the agencies in the role in deciding where money is allocated.

In addition, the Trump administration reportedly has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to halt almost all of its work that in effect shutters the agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage lending scandal.
